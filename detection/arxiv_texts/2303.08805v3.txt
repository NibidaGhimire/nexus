We report on the creation of an array of spin-squeezed ensembles of cesium atoms via Rydberg
dressing, a technique that offers optical control over local interactions between neutral atoms. We
optimize the coherence of the interactions by a stroboscopic dressing sequence that suppresses super-
Poissonian loss. We thereby prepare squeezed states of N= 200 atoms with a metrological squeezing
parameter ξ2= 0.77(9) quantifying the reduction in phase variance below the standard quantum
limit. We realize metrological gain across three spatially separated ensembles in parallel, with the
strength of squeezing controlled by the local intensity of the dressing light. Our method can be
applied to enhance the precision of tests of fundamental physics based on arrays of atomic clocks
and to enable quantum-enhanced imaging of electromagnetic fields.
Quantum projection noise limits the precision of state-
of-the-art measurements of time, acceleration, and elec-
tromagnetic fields based on spectroscopy of ensembles of
atoms. Entanglement among the constituent two-state
atoms, or equivalently spins, can enable enhanced preci-
sion by squeezing the quantum noise [1–3]. Spin squeez-
ing has been demonstrated in several experimental plat-
forms featuring all-to-all interactions, including atoms in
optical cavities [4–7], Bose-Einstein condensates [8–15],
and ions coupled by collective motion [16, 17]. How-
ever, a wide range of metrological tasks stand to bene-
fit from instead generating spin squeezing with local in-
teractions. Notably, entangling Rydberg atoms [18–29],
molecules [30], or solid-state spins [31, 32] via their native
interactions offers prospects for applying squeezing in op-
tical tweezer clocks [33, 34], electrometers [35], molecular
spectroscopy [30], and compact magnetometers [36].
For local control of spin squeezing in systems of neu-
tral atoms, several proposals have envisioned applying
the method of Rydberg dressing [24, 27–29, 37]. Here, an
off-resonant laser field hybridizes one of two ground spin
states with a Rydberg state to induce interactions with
a characteristic range on the few-micron scale [38–40].
Such short-range interactions are ideally suited to gener-
ating arrays of independent squeezed states for spatially
resolved sensing [15]. By offering local and dynamical op-
tical control [41, 42], Rydberg dressing further promises
to enable metrological protocols employing multiple in-
ternally entangled ensembles to maximize the dynamic
range of a sensor or the stability of a clock [43–45].
Several experiments have demonstrated coherent
Rydberg-dressed interactions in small systems [19, 20,
46, 47]. However, maintaining sufficient coherence to
scalably engineer many-body entanglement has so far
proven challenging [42, 48–50]. Decoherence is domi-
nated by facilitated excitation, wherein a single atom
that decays into a Rydberg state shifts the atomic transi-
tion for surrounding atoms into resonance with the dress-

ing light, triggering an avalanche of subsequent excita-
tions [48, 49, 51–53]. This effect is of greatest issue in
systems with high dimensionality, such as 3D optical lat-
tices [48, 50] and bulk gases [49]. These systems are par-
ticularly relevant in metrological applications, where in-
creased particle number enables increased measurement
precision.
In this Letter, we report on the generation of an array
of spin-squeezed atomic ensembles by Rydberg dressing.
For pseudospins encoded in the hyperfine clock states of
cesium, we generate Ising interactions by off-resonantly
coupling one clock state to a Rydberg state. Whereas
applying the dressing light continuously induces super-arXiv:2303.08805v3  [quant-ph]  23 Aug 20232
Poissonian loss attributable to avalanche effects, a stro-
boscopic pulse sequence suppresses this loss to enable
coherent interactions. We observe the dependence of the
resulting squeezing on the local intensity of the dress-
ing light and detect squeezing in three adjacent ensem-
bles, with a minimum metrological squeezing parameter
ξ2= 0.77(9).
Our experiments are conducted in a one-dimensional
array of optical microtraps [Fig. 1(a)], consisting of
nine sites with 25 µm spacing. Each array site con-
tains a cloud of typically N= 200 cesium atoms
with rms dimensions [1 .7(2),1.7(2),19(2)] µm, corre-
sponding to a peak density ρ0= 2.3(3)×1011cm−3.
We prepare the atoms in a superposition of the hy-
perfine clock states |↓⟩=6S1/2, F= 3, mF= 0
and
|↑⟩=6S1/2, F= 4, mF= 0
. To introduce Ising inter-
actions within each array site, we dress the state |↑⟩using
319 nm light detuned by an amount ∆ from the 60 P3/2
Rydberg state |r⟩[Fig. 1(b)]. A nonuniform intensity of
the dressing light across the array allows us to perform
experiments at multiple Rabi frequencies Ω in parallel.
The interactions induced by Rydberg dressing can be
understood as a suppression of the ac Stark shift that
the dressing light imparts to each atom due to the in-
fluence of nearby atoms [Fig. 1(b)]. This effect is most
pronounced for an ensemble of Natoms localized within
a critical length scale rc≈ |C6/2∆|1/6, below which the
van der Waals interaction VR=C6/r6between two Ry-
dberg atoms exceeds the pair-state detuning 2∆. In this
idealized limit, the Hamiltonian takes the form
H≈U0Sz−χ
NS2
z, (1)
where Sz= (N↑−N↓)/2 denotes the population differ-
ence between the clock states [24]. Here, U0≈Ω2/(4∆)
denotes an overall ac Stark shift that can read-
ily be removed by spin echo, while χ≈NΩ4/(16∆3)
parametrizes the mean-field interaction, which manifests
in an Szdependence of the ac Stark shift. The result-
ingSz-dependent spin precession, termed one-axis twist-
ing [1], provides a means of squeezing quantum fluctua-
tions [Fig. 1(c)].
Our experiment is guided by this idealized model of
spin squeezing by one-axis twisting but must contend
with two key factors beyond it. Firstly, we operate with
atomic clouds larger than the interaction ellipsoid with
radii rx,y,z
c≈(3,5,5)µm, so the collective spin model
in Eq. 1 only approximately describes the dynamics [54].
Secondly, the squeezing must compete with decay of the
Rydberg-dressed state, which in practice is often exac-
erbated by multibody loss processes that induce super-
Poissonian noise [48–50]. We focus first on minimizing
such loss to optimize the coherence of the dressing, be-
fore examining the role of the finite interaction range and
observing the resulting squeezing.
We maximize coherence in our system by implement-

ing a stroboscopic dressing sequence [Fig. 2(a)] de-
signed to suppress facilitated excitation to the Rydberg
state [Fig. 2(b)]. We apply the dressing light in a se-
quence of pulses, each smoothly shaped to ensure that
the dressing is adiabatic and ideally leaves all atoms in
the ground state |↑⟩at the end of the pulse. Nonideal-
ities, including incoherent excitation due to laser phase
noise and blackbody decay to nearby Rydberg SandD
states that are dipole-coupled to the dressing state |r⟩,
can nevertheless lead to atoms populating the Rydberg
manifold. A separation τdbetween the pulses provides
time for any contaminant atoms to decay or be expelled
by antitrapping, thereby averting avalanche effects. Such
stroboscopic dressing was proposed in Refs. [20, 50] and
implemented in Ref. [41] for measurements of mean-field
dynamics.
For spin squeezing, optimization of the dressing pulse
sequence is essential to avoiding even subtle loss processes
that add percent-level noise to the quantum state. To
probe such loss, we first prepare each atom in an equal su-
perposition state |π/2⟩= (|↑⟩+|↓⟩)/√
2, obtained by a
π/2 microwave rotation of the initial state |↓⟩[Fig. 2(a)].3
We then apply a sequence of dressing pulses separated by
a variable time τd. Since the dressing light affects only
state|↑⟩, any light-induced loss manifests in a population
difference between the two spin states, which we read out
by state-sensitive fluorescence imaging.
Figure 2(c) shows representative histograms of the
population imbalance Sz/Nbetween the clock states in a
single microtrap after a total dressing time τint= 30 µs.
For light applied in a single long pulse ( τd= 0), we ob-
serve loss from state |↑⟩and accompanying noise in the
atomic state populations. Performing the same analy-
sis for all microtraps, which experience different levels
of loss due to the spatially varying light intensity, we
plot the spin noise versus loss in Fig. 2(d). Specifically,
we define σ2= 4(∆ Sz)2/Nas the variance normalized
to that of a coherent spin state and plot σ2as a func-
tion of the fractional loss ℓ= (⟨Sz⟩0− ⟨Sz⟩)/N, where
⟨Sz⟩0≈0 is the population imbalance in the absence
of dressing light. For small loss ℓ, we observe a growth
σ2≈1 +gℓ, where the slope g= 17(1) exceeding unity
evidences super-Poissonian statistics.
The loss is suppressed by introducing a delay between
the dressing pulses. In particular, we divide the total
dressing time τintintoM= 48 pulses spaced by a vari-
able delay. The histogram of the state populations after
dressing with delay τd= 100 µs [Fig. 2(c)] exhibits sub-
stantially reduced loss and negligible broadening. Plot-
ting the dependence of the spin noise σ2on the delay
τd[Fig. 2(e)] reveals that the noise decays to the quan-
tum projection noise level σ2= 1 on a characteristic
timescale γ−1= 29(9) µs. We attribute this timescale
to a combination of the Rydberg atoms’ radiative decay
and ejection out of the microtraps via the repulsive pon-
deromotive force, both of which occur on times of order
100µs [54, 55]. We henceforth set τd= 100 µs to ensure
negligible broadening of the Szdistribution.
Observing the interactions induced by Rydberg dress-
ing requires measuring the Sz-dependent phase accrual
due to the dressing light. Specifically, the dressing light
shifts the clock transition of each atom by an amount

To experimentally determine the number of interact-
ing neighbors and the collective interaction strength, we
measure the ac Stark shift for atoms prepared in different
initial states |θ⟩= cos ( θ/2)|↑⟩+ sin ( θ/2)|↓⟩. We per-
form each measurement via the Ramsey sequence shown
in Fig. 3(a), where stroboscopic dressing is followed by a
π/2 microwave rotation that converts the acquired phase
into a measurable population difference. Based on the
total phase shift ϕ=R
U(t)dtmeasured in the Ramsey
sequence and the known shape of the dressing pulse, we
determine the ac Stark shift U[54]. The dependence of
Uon detuning ∆ is shown in Fig. 3(b) for three differ-
ent polar angles θ= (π/4, π/2,3π/4) of the collective
Bloch vector. The suppression of the ac Stark shift with
decreasing polar angle evidences interactions among the
Rydberg-dressed atoms in state |↑⟩.

c=Nccos2(θ/2) reveal the total number
of neighbors Ncwithin the interaction ellipsoid in each
microtrap [Fig. 3(d)]. The result of Nc≈13 neighbors,
approximately consistent with the atomic density and the
calculated Rydberg-dressed potential [54], confirms that
the total system size is N/N c≈15 times larger than the
interaction ellipsoid, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a).
To generate spin squeezing, we apply stroboscopic
Rydberg dressing to an initial spin-polarized state
|θ⟩=|π/2⟩along ˆ x. We isolate the twisting effect of the
Ising term in Eq. 1 by a spin echo sequence [Fig. 4(a)] that
removes the average ac Stark shift U0. After applying
M= 48 dressing pulses at a detuning ∆ ∗= 2π×8 MHz
and a central Rabi frequency Ω ≈2π×1.2 MHz,
we measure the spin projection in a given quadrature
Sα=Szcos(α) +Sysin(α) by performing a microwave
rotation by an angle αabout the mean spin vector
⟨S⟩ ∝ˆ xand reading out Szvia state-sensitive fluores-
cence imaging.
To quantify spin squeezing [Fig. 4(b)], we plot the
Wineland parameter ξ2=N(∆Sα)2/|⟨S⟩|2, where
ξ2<1 indicates enhanced angular resolution due to en-
tanglement [2]. Here, |⟨S⟩|is the length of the total spin
vector as determined from the contrast C= 2|⟨S⟩|/N
of a Ramsey fringe. We calibrate the atom number
Nby measurements of the quantum projection noise
of coherent spin states [54], where we remove a small
amount of common-mode technical noise by a linear re-
gression across microtraps. This same regression is ap-
plied to measurements of ∆ Sα. The contrast is limited to
C0= 0.95(1) by inhomogeneous trap light shifts that are
imperfectly canceled by spin echo due to atomic motion.
We choose a sufficiently short interaction time that theadditional contrast loss due to the dressing light, includ-
ing atom loss, is at most 1%.
To investigate the dependence of the squeezing on the
interaction strength χ, we leverage the variation in in-
tensity of the dressing light across the array. Figure 4(c)
shows the minimum squeezing parameter ξ2
min≡ξ2(αopt)
(green circles) for each of the nine array sites, com-
pared with the value for the same quadrature in the ab-
sence of dressing light (gray squares). In addition, we
plot an independent calibration of the twisting strength
Q≡R
χ(t)dt, based on the phase accumulated by coher-
ent states |θ⟩with different initial tilts in the full dress-
ing sequence with spin echo [41, 54]. We observe the
strongest squeezing in the array sites with the largest
twisting strength, achieving a minimum squeezing pa-
rameter ξ2
min= 0.77(9). We also observe correspond-
ingly strong antisqueezing ξ2
max≡ξ2(αopt−π/2) in the
orthogonal quadrature (orange diamonds).
The dependence of squeezing and antisqueezing on
twisting strength is summarized in Fig. 4(d). For com-
parison, the solid curves show a model of one-axis twist-
ing with Nc= 13 neighbors, accounting for the finite
baseline contrast C0. The squeezing and antisqueezing
are consistent with the model predictions augmented by
a small amount of technical noise. Our measurement in-
cludes all detection noise, which is on the scale of 3% of
the quantum projection noise. Other factors contribut-
ing excess noise may include laser intensity fluctuations
and residual effects of rare contaminant atoms.
The observed improvement in squeezing with increas-
ing twisting strength suggests that stronger squeezing is
attainable at higher laser intensity or longer interaction
time. We limit the duration of each dressing pulse to5
τp≈600 ns to avoid excess contrast loss attributable to
contaminant atoms [54]. We also limit the total duration
of the stroboscopic dressing sequence to minimize trap-
induced dephasing. This effect could be mitigated by
improved cooling or state-insensitive trapping to access
longer interaction times. In addition, higher intensity of
the dressing light could be achieved by addressing the
ensembles sequentially with a focused beam.
Stronger twisting will allow for observing limits to
squeezing due to the finite interaction range. The inho-
mogeneous density of each atomic cloud is predicted to
limit the squeezing to approximately ξ2
inh= 0.3 [27, 54]
for our parameters. Overcoming this limit, either in
an ordered array or in a shaped trapping potential,
would enable squeezing by an amount ξ2
c∝N−2/3
c set
by the number of interacting neighbors. For example,
in a fully three-dimensional system with the dressed
interaction potential in this work, a uniform density
ρ= 2×1011cm−3yields Nc≈60 and allows for squeez-
ing by ξ2≈0.09, or equivalently −10 log ξ2≈10 dB.
The squeezing might further be improved by addition of
a transverse field [29, 41] or by leveraging atomic motion
to spread correlations beyond the interaction range.
By enabling local, optical control of spin squeezing in
an array of atomic ensembles, Rydberg dressing is ide-
ally suited to enhancing multiplexed atomic clocks and
sensors. Prospective applications include clock compar-
isons for tests of fundamental physics [56], cascaded in-
terrogation schemes for clocks limited by local oscillator
noise [43, 45], and quantum-enhanced imaging of mag-
netic [15, 57] or electric [35] fields. The ability to access
many-body entanglement by stroboscopic Rydberg dress-
ing further promises to advance quantum simulations of
lattice spin models that benefit from optical control of
long-range interactions [27, 46, 58–61].
Note: During completion of this manuscript, we be-
came aware of related works demonstrating spin squeez-
ing using Rydberg interactions in two-dimensional arrays
of single atoms [62, 63]. Bornet et al. [63] achieve a
squeezing parameter ξ2≈0.4 via dipolar interactions
among Rydberg atoms. Eckner et al. [62] demonstrate
long-lived spin squeezing by Rydberg dressing in an op-
tical clock, observing squeezing ξ2≈0.4 that saturates
as the atom number is increased from N= 4 to N= 70.
The authors attribute this saturation to collective dis-
sipation, which might be mitigated by the stroboscopic
dressing introduced here.

Supplemental Material
In this supplement, we provide additional information about our experimental methods and theoretical models. In
Sec. I, we describe the experimental setup, calibrations, and data analysis methods. In Sec. II, we derive theoretical
models for the interactions induced by Rydberg dressing and the resulting spin squeezing, and we apply these models
to examine limits to squeezing imposed by the finite interaction range. We also present supporting information
regarding the contaminant atoms that require us to perform the Rydberg dressing stroboscopically.
I. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
A. Projection noise calibration
An accurate calibration of the atom number Nis crucial to quantifying spin squeezing. We calibrate the number
of atoms by measuring the quantum projection noise of coherent spin states with variable initial tilt θ. These data
generically allow for distinguishing quantum projection noise from any technical noise sources via the dependence on
θ. Fitting the projection noise with the known variance of the binomial distribution then provides a precise calibration
of the atom number. Specifically, for a coherent state prepared at a polar angle θon the Bloch sphere, the probability
that an atom is measured in state |↑⟩isp= cos2(θ/2). Accordingly, the fraction f↑of atoms measured in |↑⟩follows
a binomial distribution with mean pand variance σ2
f=p(1−p)/N. The variance of the fractional difference f↑−f↓
in populations of the two spin states, where f↓= 1−f↑, is then V[ f↑−f↓] = 4p(1−p)/N.
We prepare different initial states |θ⟩by applying a resonant microwave drive pulse of varying length. We perform
100 measurements of f↑at each initial state to determine the expectation value E[ f↑] and variance V[ f↑−f↓]. The
results of a typical projection noise calibration are shown in Fig. S1. We post-process our measurements of f↑by
performing a linear spatial regression across microtraps. This removes correlated noise that arises as a result of
common-mode experimental errors, such as microwave power fluctuations. The average amounts of technical noise
removed by the spatial regression across microtraps, normalized to the maximum variance, are on the 10% level. We
fit the remaining noise with the functional form
V[f↑−f↓] =4p(1−p)
N+ap2+/parenleftbiggb
N/parenrightbigg2
(S1)
with N,a, and bas free parameters. The term ap2accounts for atom-related technical noise during imaging: a
small fraction of the atoms decay into |F= 3⟩as they are imaged in |F= 4⟩, and aquantifies any fluctuations in
this fraction. The constant term baccounts for detection noise from our EMCCD camera. For the data plotted in
Fig. S1(a), we obtain mean values of N= 220(6) atoms, a= 0(2) ×10−5, and b= 2.3(1). The fit value for brepresents
an atom number resolution equivalent to 3% of the projection noise variance, while the remaining technical noise is
consistent with zero.

FIG. S2. Contrast calibration . (a) Schematic pulse train for contrast calibration with dressing light. Here Rϕ(θ) denotes a
microwave rotation about an axis ϕby an angle θ. In the case of our baseline contrast calibration, the same pulse sequence is
performed with the omission of the dressing pulses (blue). (b) Fits to Ramsey fringe with (blue circles) and without (orange
triangles) the application of dressing light, for calibrating the contrast of microtrap 5. (c) Measured loss Lwithin each microtrap

B. Contrast calibration
We calibrate the contrast Cused to calculate the Wineland squeezing parameter by Ramsey interferometry, as
shown in Fig. S2(a). This calibration is performed both with and without applying the dressing light [Fig. S2(b)]. In
both cases, we fix the Ramsey time to 4 .8 ms and include spin-echo pulses, thereby calibrating the contrast under the
same conditions as in the squeezing measurement. We attribute the non-unity baseline contrast to inhomogeneous
trap light shifts that are imperfectly canceled by spin echo due to atomic motion. This calibration is carried out both
before and after the squeezing measurement, with results for the contrast consistent within error.
In calibrating the contrast with dressing pulses, we make a small correction to the fringe amplitude obtained from
the fit to account for atom loss from the microtraps. We determine the average loss directly from the atomic signal in
the data used for squeezing by comparing measurements with and without dressing light taken in alternate shots of
the experiment. The resulting ratio N/N 0of atom number in each microtrap with and without dressing determines
the loss L= 1−N/N 0plotted in Fig. S2(c). We then multiply the amplitude of the Ramsey fringe measured after
dressing by N/N 0to obtain the contrast Cincluding loss, which we apply in calculating the squeezing parameter. The
data shown in Fig. S2(b) yield a loss-adjusted contrast C= 0.95(2) with the dressing light and a baseline contrast
C0= 0.96(2) in the absence of dressing light.
C. Atomic state preparation and detection
After initial cooling in a magneto-optical trap and optical molasses, cesium atoms are loaded into a 1064 nm optical
dipole trap with a ∼50µm waist and trap depth h×5(1) MHz. The atoms are then transported to a science
chamber by scanning the focus of an electrically tunable lens (Optotune). A bright molasses stage loads the atoms
into a one-dimensional array of 1064 nm microtraps, which is generated by a crossed acousto-optic deflector (AOD)
system. This array consists of a set of nine microtraps spaced 25 µm apart, each with a waist of 6 µm. The dipole trap
is briefly turned off to allow any atoms not confined in microtraps to escape, and is then turned back on to provide
additional confinement along the microtraps’ axial dimension. After state preparation, the measured temperature of
the atoms in each trap is T= 22(1) µK. The resulting rms cloud sizes are σ(x,y,z)= [1.7(2),1.7(2),19(2)] µm, where
ˆ zdenotes the vertical direction in the lab and ˆ xdenotes the axis of the array. With an average of N= 200 atoms per
trap, the peak atomic density is ρ0= 2.3(3)×1011cm−3.
The science chamber contains an array of eight stainless steel electrodes with independently tunable voltages. We
calibrate these voltages to minimize the electric field along three orthogonal axes by measuring the quadratic Stark
shift of the/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60P3/2/angbracketrightbig
Rydberg state. These calibrated voltages are fixed for the duration of the experimental sequence.
We perform state-sensitive fluorescence imaging on the D2line using 852 nm light. Prior to imaging, we change
the spacing of the microtraps from 25 µm to 50 µm apart by ramping AOD frequencies, phases, and amplitudes with3
a jerk-minimizing polynomial ramp over 5–6 ms, such that fractional fluorescence from one microtrap detected in an
adjacent trap is at most 1%. During imaging, we first use light tuned to the |F= 4⟩ − → | F′= 5⟩transition to image
only the |F= 4⟩atoms. After this, we reapply the same pulse to resonantly expel any remaining |F= 4⟩atoms. We
then apply a microwave πpulse to transfer atoms from |F= 3, mF= 0⟩ − → | F= 4, mF= 0⟩and perform resonant
fluorescence imaging once again. Typically, around 5% of all atoms are in |F= 3, mF̸= 0⟩states due to imperfect
optical pumping; these atoms do not contribute to the experiment, as they are not affected by microwave pulses or
Rydberg dressing light and do not contribute to detected fluorescence during the imaging sequence. We measure a
3% decrease in our imaging efficiency for |F= 3⟩atoms relative to |F= 4⟩. We attribute this to an imperfect πpulse
during |F= 3⟩readout and calibrate our fluorescence signals to account for this effect.
D. Microwave parameters, sequences, and calibration
We measure an average microwave Rabi frequency Ω MW= 2π×18.9(2) kHz, with percent-level inhomogeneity
in Ω MWacross microtraps. One small but important source of calibration error and drift is the differential ac Stark
shift from the trapping light, which shifts the clock state resonance by approximately 500 Hz. We initially calibrate
our microtrap light intensities such that the ac Stark shift of the clock transition is the same to within 5 Hz across
all microtraps. During a typical measurement, the center of the dipole trap (which provides confinement in the
axial dimension of each microtrap) can drift by ±3µm, which results in a measured microwave resonance drift of
approximately ±25 Hz, a non-negligible shift compared to the ∼200 Hz frequency scale set by typical Ramsey
sequence times.
We implement spin echoes primarily to cancel the average ac Stark shift from the Rydberg dressing light, as discussed
in Sec. I E, but secondarily to (a) cancel any remaining systematic drifts that result in microwave calibration error,
and (b) mitigate sensitivity to the percent-level gradient in microwave Rabi frequency. Borrowing spin-refocusing
techniques from NMR, we use the sequence MLEV-4 [1], in which every “unit” of 4 spin echoes takes the form of
rotations around (X, X, -X, -X), and where each pulse is a single πpulse rather than a composite pulse. This
sequence provides the best Ramsey contrast for our typical dressing Ramsey sequence times of ∼4.8 ms. The
microwave pulse train consists of 3 MLEV-4 “units” for a total of 12 π-pulses, one every ∼400µs, and is used in every
sequence in this paper that requires spin echoes.
E. Rydberg dressing laser system, parameters, and pulse shaping
To generate the 319 nm Rydberg dressing light, we start with 1275 nm light from an external-cavity diode laser
(LEOS Solutions) that is used to seed a pre-amplifier (Thorlabs BOA1130P) followed by a Raman fiber amplifier (RFA,
MPB Communications). The seed light is frequency-stabilized by a Pound-Drever-Hall lock to a ULE reference cavity
(Stable Laser Systems). Light from the RFA is resonantly doubled in two stages (LEOS Solutions), each consisting
of an LBO crystal in a bow-tie optical cavity. We use an electro-optic polarization modulator (QUBIG GmbH) and
α-BBO Glan-Taylor polarizer (Eksma) to stabilize the power of the 319 nm light (Supplemental Material, [2]), followed
by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) for generating and shaping the Rydberg dressing pulses. The dressing light is
then focused down to a waist of 55 µm and intersects the 1D array of microtraps at a 30◦angle of incidence [Fig. 1(a)],
such that the beam addresses most of the microtraps but with a spatially varying intensity that allows us to explore
different Rabi frequencies within a single measurement.
We dress with the 60 P3/2Rydberg state, which has an attractive van der Waals interaction characterized by the
coefficient |C6|= 2π×359 GHz µm6. We use σ+–polarized light to couple from the ground state/vextendsingle/vextendsingle6S1/2, F= 4, mF= 0/angbracketrightbig
to the/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60P3/2, J= 3/2, mJ= 3/2/angbracketrightbig
and/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60P3/2, J= 3/2, mJ= 1/2/angbracketrightbig
states. At our typical power of 300 mW and beam
waist of 55 µm, we measure Rabi frequencies Ω /(2π) = 1.3–1.5 MHz. As the sign of C6is negative, we work at a
positive (blue) detuning ∆ ∗≈2π×8 MHz from the/vextendsingle/vextendsingle6S1/2, F= 4, mF= 0/angbracketrightbig
− →/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60P3/2/angbracketrightbig
resonance to avoid crossing
the pair-state energy of two Rydberg atoms at any length scale. In prior work we operated at n= 43 due to an
enhanced C6coefficient from a nearby F¨ orster resonance [3], but we have since found that this near-F¨ orster-resonant
dressing causes increased loss compared to n= 60 under similar experimental conditions.
We shape the Rydberg dressing pulses by applying a 2 .5 MHz low-pass filter (Mini-Circuits BLP-1.9+) to a train
of square pulses produced by an arbitrary waveform generator, which is then used to modulate the RF power driving
the AOM. These shaped pulses allow us to avoid ∼2 MHz sidebands produced by square pulses of approximately
500 ns in length; the red-detuned 3rdand 4th–orders of these unwanted sidebands address the atoms at a frequency at
or very near resonance compared to our chosen +8 MHz detuning, leading to measurable excess loss. We characterize
the pulse shape by the intensity profile h(t) of our light as measured on a photodiode, normalized to a peak value4

For terms of order k >0 in Ω2, such as the k= 1 and k= 2 terms in the expansion for Ufound in Eq. S11, we define
a corrected effective interaction time

for a single shaped pulse. We additionally define T0=τp, representing the interaction time for an idealized square
pulse; for pulses typically used in our twisting and squeezing sequences, we find T1/T0≈0.95 and T2/T0≈0.83. We
account for these corrections in all fits that involve Ω.
F. Twisting and dressed pulse length calibrations
Once we determine a dressing pulse delay τd= 100 µs and fix our spin echo pulse separation at 400 µs [Fig. S2(a)],
we still have the freedom to choose a pulse length τpand total interaction time τint. Fixing the number of pulses
M= 48 and measuring the one axis twisting-like phase precession ϕof states initialized at θ= 3π/4 and π/2 on the
Bloch sphere, we calculate the twisting strength Qviaϕ=−Qcosθ, as in Ref. [3]. In Fig. S3(a), Qis plotted as a
function of the total dressed interaction time τint=Mτp= 48τp. A linear fit gives a mean-field interaction strength
ofχ= 2π×6.4(8) kHz for these data. We generally choose τpsuch that one or more microtraps has a twisting
strength Q≥1 rad, but also such that our contrast does not significantly decay.
After scanning τpat a fixed pulse number and thus a varying total interaction time, we may also ask whether the
contrast decay we observe for larger τpvanishes at fixed interaction time. In Fig. S3(b) we plot Qversus contrast
(normalized to the contrast with no dressing light) for three different pulse lengths τp= (630 ns ,940 ns ,1.9µs) and
corresponding pulse numbers M= (48, 32, 16), chosen such that the interaction time τint=Mτpremains constant.
The pulse delay remained fixed at τd= 100 µs, and as a result the number of total spin echoes (12, 8, 4) and Ramsey
times (4.8, 3.2, 1.6) ms were allowed to vary between datasets. Here we observe that longer dressing pulses lead5

Q) yields σQ= [4.1(8),2.1(4),1.2(1)] rad, respectively. For the shortest pulses, the value σQ= 4.1(8) rad
is consistent with the prediction of the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian with Nc= 16(6) atoms within the interaction
range (Sec. II C 1).
To accompany every noise measurement shown in this Letter, we took independent measurements of the quantities
Q, dressing Rabi frequency Ω p, and atom number Nfor each microtrap. Plotting Qas a function of NΩ4
pτint/(16∆3)
[Fig. S3(c)] allows us to observe an approximately linear relationship, with the slope describing the fraction of interact-
ing neighbors within each trap, Nc/N. While we cannot continuously measure Qand take other data simultaneously,
we calibrate Qboth before and after every noise measurement.
II. THEORY
A. Collective interactions via Rydberg dressing

resulting collective interaction strength χ. Consider a cloud of NRydberg-dressed atoms in the fully blockaded regime,

B. Rydberg-dressed ground state interaction potential and interaction strength distribution
To compare the measured interaction parameters ( χ, N c) with theoretical predictions, we calculate the dressed
ground-state interaction potential using Rydberg pair potentials [6], Rabi frequency Ω = 2 π×1.305 MHz, and
detuning ∆ ∗= 2π×8 MHz, as described in Ref. [3]. The interaction potential is shown in Fig. S5(a-b), where ϑ= 0
is referenced to the propagation direction of the Rydberg dressing beam, which is orthogonal to the axial ( ˆ z) direction
of the traps as defined in Sec. I C. From this interaction potential, we generate a matrix of pairwise interactions Jij
by simulating the spatial distribution of the atoms in a single microtrap, sampling atom positions from Gaussian7

values Ncdetermined from the suppression of the ac Stark shift in Fig. 3 of the main text.
C. Squeezing dynamics
In Fig. 4 of the main text we compare the measured squeezing with a model of one-axis twisting with total spin
S=Nc/2. Here we give expressions for this model, including the effect of finite baseline contrast C0. We also
compare the model of one-axis twisting with Ncneighbors to an exact calculation of the Ising dynamics with pairwise
interactions given by the Rydberg-dressed potential, and to an opposite limit of ideal one-axis twisting with global
interactions among all Natoms.
1. Spin squeezing by one-axis twisting
Analytic expressions for the squeezing arising from the one-axis twisting Hamiltonian were derived by Kitagawa
and Ueda in Ref. [7]. Briefly, the approach is to calculate the time evolution of the variance ⟨S2
y⟩and covariance
⟨SySz+SzSy⟩under the Hamiltonian Htwist =−χS2
z/Nfor a system initialized in a coherent spin state along ˆ x.
From these quantities, as well as ⟨S2
z⟩=S/2 which remains invariant, one obtains the spin variance
⟨S2
α⟩=⟨S2
z⟩cos2α+⟨S2
y⟩sin2α+⟨SySz+SzSy⟩sinαcosα (S17)
as a function of rotation angle α. By symmetry ⟨Sy⟩=⟨Sz⟩= 0, so extremizing Eq. S17 with respect to αyields the
minimum and maximum variances

In modeling the squeezing in our experiment we account for imperfect initial contrast C0. We assume that the im-
perfect contrast is due to uncorrelated phase shifts ϕj, with ⟨ϕ⟩= 0, applied to the atoms indexed j. Correspondingly,
the spin raising operator for the jthatom in the Heisenberg picture is modified as
s+
j→s+

leading to a reduced length of the collective Bloch vector
⟨Sx⟩ → C 0⟨Sx⟩, (S24)
where C0=⟨cosϕ⟩. In addition to shortening the Bloch vector, the imperfect contrast reduces the correlations

We apply Eqs. S26(a-c) to model the squeezing and antisqueezing in the main text.
In addition, we compare Eq. S26a to the measured dependence of contrast on twisting strength in Sec. I F of the
supplement. In the experimentally relevant regime Q≪S, the length of the collective spin vector decays as a Gaussian
function of the twisting strength: ⟨Sx⟩=Se−Q2/(2σ2
Q), where σQ= 2S/√

2. Effects of finite interaction range
While all-to-all coupled systems preserve a permutation symmetry that conserves the total system spin S, no such
symmetry exists for systems with finite-range interactions, and we thus expect the squeezing ξ2
minultimately to be
limited by a decrease in signal |⟨S⟩|with increasing interaction time. This limitation is particularly fundamental for
the case of Ising interactions: due to the absence of non-commuting terms in the Hamiltonian, correlations form only
between pairs of atoms that interact directly and thus, in the idealized limit where the atomic positions are pinned,
the correlations cannot spread beyond the interaction range. An additional limitation arising from the locality of
interactions is that the interaction strength is sensitive to the local density.9

FIG. S6. Effects of finite interaction range and inhomogeneous density. Simulated squeezing dynamics for an in-
homogeneous cloud matching our experimental trap geometry and Rydberg interaction parameters from Fig. S5. Solid blue
line denotes average value over 1000 instances, while blue shading denotes ±1σvalues. The olive curves and shading show
analytical predictions for the range of expected squeezing for all-to-all coupled systems with Nc= 13 atoms (light olive dotted,
our empirical value) to Nc= 19 atoms (dark olive dash-dotted, based on the estimate Nc=⟨χ⟩/|J0|from the simulated
distribution of interaction strengths in Fig. S5). We additionally show the analytical all-to-all prediction for N= 63 atoms (red
dash-dot), which would be achieved by extending the system to be larger than the interaction range in all three dimensions at
fixed density ρ= 2×1011cm−3, as well as simulated results for N= 200 (yellow dashed) and N= 1000 (orange dashed) on
a 3D lattice with the same density. The purple dash-dotted curve shows the analytical all-to-all prediction for our full system
size of N= 200 atoms.
To analyze the limits to squeezing with the local Ising interactions produced by Rydberg dressing, we perform a
full simulation of the squeezing dynamics in a Gaussian cloud of atoms. Because the Ising interactions contain no
non-commuting terms, one can efficiently compute the time evolution for any specified set of pairwise interactions
Jij[8]. Following the example of Ref. [8], we compute correlation functions of the form ⟨sα
isβ
j⟩between pairs of
individual spins ( i, j). From these pairwise correlations we calculate moments of collective observables, and thus the
squeezing parameter, following Eqs. S17-S21.
The results of the simulation are shown in Fig. S6. Each instance of the simulation samples N= 200 atoms from
a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution with standard deviations σ(x,y,z)= (1.7, 1.7, 19) µm as measured in our
experiment, corresponding to a peak density ρ0= 2.3×1011cm−3. For simplicity, the atoms are assumed to be at rest
during the simulation. From the atomic coordinates and the calculated Rydberg-dressed potential shown in Sec. II B,
we generate a pairwise interaction matrix and calculate the corresponding local mean-field interaction strengths χ
(Fig. S5). We then calculate the average twisting strength Q=⟨χ⟩τintas a function of the interaction time τint. In
Fig. S6, we plot the squeezing parameter ξ2
minaveraged over 1000 instances as a function of Qin solid blue, with
shading at ±1σ.
To examine the impact of the finite interaction range and the spatial inhomogeneity on the squeezing, we compare
the full simulation of the short-range interactions with models of ideal one-axis twisting. The olive curves and shading
in Fig. S6 account for the finite interaction range by showing analytical predictions for all-to-all coupled one-axis
twisting with total spin S=Nc/2, where we set either (1) Nc=⟨χ⟩/J0= 19 atoms (dark olive dash-dot), the average
number of neighbors predicted for our atomic cloud based on the calculated interaction potential; or (2) Nc= 13 atoms
(light olive dotted), the average extracted value across microtraps from the fits in Fig. 3. The purple dash-dotted curve
compares these to an all-to-all coupled system with N= 200 atoms, the number typically found within a microtrap.
All simulations obey the limiting early-time behavior ξ2
min≈1−Q. At the twisting strengths Q < 0.7 rad accessed
in Fig. 4 of the main text, the three models examined here are indistinguishable within experimental error, showing
that the short-range character of the interactions is not the limiting factor in the present experiment.
For stronger twisting, both the finite number of neighbors and the inhomogeneous twisting strength pose limitations
to the squeezing. At fixed density and dressing parameters, the number of neighbors could be increased by modifying
the microtrap geometry. In our present experiment with rms cloud sizes σ(x,y,z)= (1.7, 1.7, 19) µm (Sec. I C) and
interaction radii ∼r(x,y,z)
c = (3, 5, 5) µm (Sec. II B), the cloud is larger than the interaction radius in only one
dimension. Increasing the radial cloud sizes at fixed density ρ= 2×1011cm−3would produce Nc= 63 neighbors
within the interaction ellipsoid. In Fig. S6, we plot the analytical prediction (red dash-dotted curve) for an all-to-all
coupled system with N= 63 which achieves a minimum squeezing parameter ξ2
min= 0.09 (equivalently 10.5 dB).10
To confirm that the one-axis twisting model provides a good approximation of the attainable squeezing in a realistic
system with uniform density, we additionally simulate the full Ising dynamics on a 3-dimensional lattice of spacing
ρ−1/3= 1.7µm with unity filling within a spherical region containing N= 200 (yellow dashed curve) or N= 1000
(orange dashed curve) atoms. These simulations are consistent with the squeezing approaching 10 dB in an ordered
array of dimensions larger than the interaction range.
3. Comparison with alternative platforms
The predicted squeezing attainable by Rydberg dressing in a large system at uniform density, at the level of 10 dB,
is less than the record spin squeezing attained in optical cavities [9, 10] but comparable to the largest enhancements
in spectroscopic sensitivity observed to date. For reference, a clock stability 10.5 dB beyond the standard quantum
limit has been demonstrated by Ramsey spectroscopy using input states squeezed by 20 dB via cavity-based quantum
non-demolition measurement [9]. A larger spectroscopic enhancement of 11.8 dB has been accessed by an echo
protocol employing cavity-mediated interactions both to generate a non-Gaussian entangled state and facilitate its
detection [11]. This protocol, which achieves a Heisenberg scaling in metrological gain through one-axis twisting,
could also be applied in future experiments with Rydberg-dressed atoms to access a larger benefit than from squeezing
alone [12, 13].
Compared with alternative methods of generating entanglement, Rydberg dressing is particularly well suited to
applications that benefit from independent control of squeezing in multiple ensembles. Prior work in this context
has leveraged collisional interactions in BECs to access 3.4 dB of metrological squeezing across an array of up to 30
ensembles and a 24% enhancement in magnetic field gradiometry [14]. Rydberg dressing offers promise for achieving
larger metrological gain, with the added benefit of optical control for switching off interactions during the operation
of a sensor or clock.
D. Contaminant Rydberg states
In Fig. 2 of the main text, we show that introducing a delay between Rydberg dressing pulses significantly reduces
super-Poissonian loss that we attribute to the presence of atoms in contaminant Rydberg states. Here we identify
the dominant contaminant states based on their branching ratios, lifetimes, and range of influence within the system
of Rydberg-dressed atoms. We also explore how the creation of contaminant atoms and their influence on the larger
system depend on system size and dimensionality.
1. Decay channels and lifetimes
We calculate decay rates from |r⟩=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60P3/2, mJ= 3/2/angbracketrightbig
to nearby SandDstates, as well as C3coefficients and
lifetimes for these contaminant states, using the Alkali Rydberg Calculator (ARC) [6]. We focus our attention on
states with C3coefficients sufficiently large to shift atoms in our ensembles into resonance with the dressing beam. We
estimate a threshold C3coefficient from our dressing detuning (∆ ∗= 2π×8 MHz) and typical interatomic distance
ofri= 1.8µm as
C3≥∆∗r3
i= 2π×47 MHz µm3. (S28)
Figure S7(a) shows the branching ratio into a given contaminant state plotted against the characteristic distance,
d= (C3/∆∗)1/3, at which the interaction shift equals the detuning of the dressing light. The branching ratio is
calculated by taking the product of the decay rate into a given state from |r⟩and the lifetime of |r⟩. For the states
shown here, the lifetimes of the SandDstates are on the order of 75 µs and 100 µs, respectively. The lifetime of |r⟩
is 150 µs.
When an atom transitions into a contaminant Rydberg state, a natural question to ask is whether the lifetime of the
resulting excitation is set by the radiative lifetime of the state, or is instead set by the antitrapping experienced by the
Rydberg atom in the presence of 1064 nm light. To estimate the antitrapping lifetime, we neglect the small thermal
velocity for atoms at 22 µK and assume atoms start at rest with an initial spatial distribution corresponding to our
measured cloud σrmsvalues from Sec. I C. We calculate the force an atom would feel were it to decay to/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60S1/2/angbracketrightbig
at
t= 0, an illustrative example contaminant state which has both a high branching ratio from/vextendsingle/vextendsingle60P3/2, mJ= 3/2/angbracketrightbig
and
a large C3coefficient. We then calculate the time required for the atom to be forced outside of the 2 σrmscloud radii in
any direction. The results of 2000 independent simulation instances are shown in Fig. S7(b). We find that the mean11

thermal timescale for trap expulsion is 115 µs, which is comparable to the radiative lifetimes of the contaminant states.
We conclude that both effects must be contributing to the effective lifetimes of any contaminant state excitations in
the cloud.
2. Effects of system size and dimensionality
The stroboscopic dressing technique introduced in this work is of particular importance for systems with large atom
number N. To understand why, we consider how system size affects the typical interaction time needed to create a
contaminant atom in a simple model that assumes adiabatic dressing pulses but allows for an enhanced excitation
rate due to laser phase noise. The rate γexcof incoherent excitation from the ground state |↑⟩to the Rydberg state
|r⟩is given by
γexc=(γL+ Γr) Ω2
(γL+ Γr)2+ 4∆2, (S29)
where Γ ris the linewidth of the Rydberg state |r⟩with which we are dressing and the γLis the linewidth of the dressing
laser, presumed to be Lorentzian. Atoms also undergo two-photon scattering directly from |↑⟩into contaminant
Rydberg states at a rate (Ω /2∆)2γBB, where γBBis the blackbody decay rate from |r⟩. However, this rate is
insufficient to explain the loss in our experiments, suggesting that the dominant pathway is excitation to |r⟩at a
rateγexcthat is governed by laser noise, followed by decay to contaminant states at rate γBB. For sufficiently short
interaction times τintwe may take the total number of atoms N↑in the state |↑⟩to be constant, and the expected
number of excitations to |r⟩is then Nr=γexcτintN↑. For a decay rate γBBfrom|r⟩to a contaminant Rydberg state
|c⟩, the expected time Tcto produce a single atom in |c⟩is then
Tc=/radicalbigg2
γexcγBBN↑. (S30)
For the 60P 3/2Rydberg state, the room-temperature blackbody transition rate is γBB≈2π×800 Hz and the linewidth
is Γr≈2π×1 kHz. For a representative laser linewidth γL= 2π×10 kHz, Rabi frequency Ω = 2 π×1.2 MHz,
detuning ∆ = 2 π×8 MHz, and system with N↑= 100 atoms in |↑⟩, the continuous interaction time expected to
produce a single contaminant atom is Tc≈100µs. Note that Tcdecreases with larger system sizes as Tc∝1/√
N↑,
a scaling that highlights the particular importance of stroboscopic dressing techniques in larger systems.
We now consider how the influence of a contaminant atom on neighboring ground-state atoms depends on system
size and dimensionality. As shown in Fig. S7(a), the characteristic distance d= (C3/∆)1/3over which a contaminant12
atom strongly affects ground-state atoms is d≈10µm. We define Ndto be the number of atoms within a distance dof
a contaminant atom. For simplicity, we consider the worst-case condition that all Ndatoms are lost from the system,
corresponding to a super-Poissonian loss process in which atoms are lost in groups of size g= 1 + Nd. For a small
fractional atom loss ℓ, this process adds an amount gℓof noise to the normalized variance σ2, as observed in Fig. 2(d).
If a system of Natoms is small compared to din all dimensions, a single contaminant atom interacts with all ground-
state atoms and we have Nd=N↑=N/2. This is approximately the case in our present work, where dfor relevant
contaminant states is larger than the radius σx,yof each cloud and comparable to the length σz. For systems of density
ρthat are larger than dinDdimensions, however, the number of ground-state atoms affected by a contaminant atom
becomes Nd∝ρ×(C3/∆)D/3. This adverse scaling with density ρand dimensionality Dcorroborates the myriad
of experimental results that have observed avalanche decay when implementing Rydberg-dressed interactions in large
systems [15–18].
