1. Introduction
LetOKbe a henselian discrete valuation ring with ﬁeld of fractions Kand
residue ﬁeld kof characteristic p >0. LetW(k) be the ﬁeld of Witt vectors with
coeﬃcients in kandK0its ﬁeld of fractions. For some results, we will need the
following additional assumptions
(∗)kis perfect and Kis a ﬁnite extension of K0; in particular OKis of mixed
characteristic, complete and totally ramiﬁed over W(k).
One of the main scope of this paper is to extend Theorem A below to th e
logarithmic context. For clarity we recall some details.
1.1. The classical case: p-divisible groups and crystalline representa-
tions.Assume that OKsatisﬁes (∗). LetKbe a ﬁxed algebraic closure of Kand
GK= Gal(K/K) the absolute Galois group of K. LetBTOK(resp.BTK) be the
category of p-divisible groups (or Barsotti-Tate groups) over OK(resp.K). Let
RepZp(GK) (resp.RepQp(GK)) be the category of (continuous) representations of
GKon freeZp-modules of ﬁnite rank (resp. ﬁnite-dimensional Qp-vector spaces),
and letRepcris,{0,1}
•(GK) for•=Zp,Qp, denote the full subcategory of Rep•(GK)
consisting of crystalline representations with Hodge-Tate weights in{0,1}.LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 3
For anyHK= lim−→nHK,ninBTK, theTate module
Tp(HK) = lim←−nHK,n(K)
ofHKlies inRepZp(GK) naturally, and Vp(HK) :=Tp(HK)⊗ZpQp∈RepQp(GK).
ForH∈BTOK, letTp(H) :=Tp(HK) andVp(H) :=Vp(HK). Then, one has the
following well-known theorem.
Theorem A.The fully faithful functors
Tp:BTOK→RepZp(GK), Vp:BTOK⊗Q→RepQp(GK)
induce equivalences of categories
Tp:BTOK∼−→Repcris,{0,1}
Zp(GK), Vp:BTOK⊗Q∼−→Repcris,{0,1}
Qp(GK).
We refer to Section 2 for more details on the above result.
1.2. The logarithmic case: log p-divisible groups and semistable rep-
resentations. LetRepst
•(GK) for•=Zp,Qp, denote the full subcategory of
Rep•(GK) consisting of semistable representations. In view of Theorem A, a n
objectT∈Repcris,{0,1}
Zp(GK) corresponds to a p-divisible group HKoverKhaving
good reduction, i.e., HKextends to H∈BTOKwhich is unique up to unique iso-
morphism by Tate’s theorem (see [ 26, Thm. 4]). It is natural to ask the following
question
⋆Does an object T∈Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK) correspond to a p-divisible group HK
overKhaving “semistable reduction” in whatever sense?
To answer the question ⋆, one has to deﬁne the notion “having semistable re-
duction” for p-divisible groups over Kwhich is less clear than the notation “having
good reduction”. This notion is supplied by de Jong in [ 6, Def. 2.2] (see Deﬁnition
5.1) without the assumption ( ∗). We denote by BTst
Kthe full subcategory of BTK
consisting of p-divisible groups having semistable reduction in the sense of de Jong.
However, de Jong’s deﬁnition describes having semistable reduction without
specifying the degeneration. This is simply because it is not possible to construct
degenerations of p-divisible groups in the classical geometric world. It is well-
known that log geometry is the perfect framework for dealing with d egeneration.
LetS:= Spec( OK) endowed with the canonical log structure. Kato introduced log
p-divisible groups in [ 15] (see Deﬁnition 3.2), and dual representable log p-divisible
groups (see (3.3)) over Sserve as the degeneration of p-divisible groups having
semistable reduction over K. LetBTlog
S,dbe the category of dual representable log
p-divisible groups over S.
In order to answer the question ⋆under the stronger assumption ( ∗), we study
the relations among the three (instead of two in the crystalline case ) categories4 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK),BTst
K, andBTlog
S,d. For the relation between BTst
KandBTlog
S,d, we
do not add the assumption ( ∗).
Since the log structure of Sis supported on the closed point, the generic ﬁber
HK:=H×SSpecKofH∈BTlog
S,dis a classical p-divisible group over K(see the
proof of Theorem 5.19 for more details). Thus we have a natural fu nctor
( )K:BTlog
S,d→BTK, H/mapsto→HK.
We denote the compositions
BTlog
S,d( )K−−−→BTKTp−→RepZp(GK)
and
BTlog
S,d⊗Q( )K−−−→BTK⊗QVp−→RepQp(GK)
asTpandVp, respectively, by abuse of notation. Our ﬁrst main result is the
following theorem.
Theorem B.(a) The functor
( )K:BTlog
S,d→BTK
is fully faithful and has essential image the full subcategory BTst
K.
(b) Assume that OKsatisﬁes the extra assumption ( ∗). Then the functor
Tp:BTlog
S,d→RepZp(GK) (resp.Vp:BTlog
S,d⊗Q→RepQp(GK))
is fully faithful and its essential image is exactly the full subcategor y
Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK) (resp.Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK)).
One can illustrate the above theorem as the following diagram

of equivalences of categories. Part (a) of the theorem follows fro m Theorem 5.19
while part (b) is Theorem 6.12.
In Section 6.4 we deduce from Theorem B the following p-adic N´ eron-Ogg-
Shafarevich criterion for semistable reduction of abelian varieties.
Corollary C.Assume that OKsatisﬁes the extra assumption ( ∗), and let
AKbe an abelian variety over K. ThenAKhas semistable reduction if and only if
Tp(AK) is a semistable Galois representation.
An anonymous referee brought our attention to the relation betw een logp-
divisible groupsand stronglydivisible modules (asdeﬁned in [ 3,§2.2]), assuggested
by Breuil in [ 2, Rmk. 4.2.2.12]. We then noticed that another consequence of
Theorem B, also proved in Section 6.4, is the following corollary.LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 5
Corollary D.Assume that OKsatisﬁes the extra assumption ( ∗), andp≥3.
Then the category BTlog
S,dis anti-equivalent to the category of strongly divisible
modules of weight ≤1.
Strictly speaking, only part (b) of Theorem B is the exact analogueo f Theorem
A. One can try to use the strategy of the proof of Theorem A to pr ove Theorem B
(b). For this one needs to have at least
(1) a logarithmic version of Tate’s theorem [ 26, Cor. 1];
(2) a logarithmic version of [ 17, Cor. 2.2.6], which is [ 2, Thm. 1.4] when
p/ne}ationslash= 2 and k⊂Fp;
(3) a logarithmic version of Raynaud’s results [ 24,§2.1 and Prop. 2.3.1].
To the authors’ knowledge, these results have not appeared in th e literature. The
third author has an old unpublished draft on (1) in which a part of (3) has also
been considered.
At last, we would like to make some comments on our approach to Theo rem
B. Note that one could prove ﬁrst Corollary D and then deduce Theo rem B (b),
at least for p >2. However, this seems a demanding job as well. In our approach,
we use Fargues’ results from [ 7, 8], which do not require p >2, to relate the
two categories BTst
KandRepst,{0,1}
Zp(GK). Then we use Grothendieck’s theory
of panach´ ee extensions to study the relations between BTlog
S,dandBTst
Kwith the
help of Kummer log ﬂat cohomology, and Kis only assumed to be henselian here
(no completeness and no restriction on the residue ﬁeld). The theo ry of panach´ ee
extensions is alsoused to construct the Grothendieck monodromy for logp-divisible
groups,seethenextsubsection. Log p-divisiblegroupsaregeometricobjectsdeﬁned
in the Kummer log ﬂat topology. We believe that our approach involving log
geometry and Kummer log ﬂat cohomology is very natural, although it might not
be the only one.
1.3. Comparisons of monodromies. Objects of the equivalent categories
in (1.1) are endowed with natural monodromy maps. We complete our study of
the equivalences in (1.1) by showing that they preserve monodromy .
LetH∈BTlog
S,d, and let 0→H◦→H→H´ et→0 be the connected-´ etale
decomposition of H(see [27,§3.2]). By [ 27, Prop. 3.9], both H◦andH´ etare clas-
sicalp-divisible groups. By Kato’s classiﬁcation theorem of log p-divisible group,
see Theorem 3.15, any object H∈BTlog
S,dcorresponds to a pair ( Hcl,β), where
•Hclis a classical p-divisible group and called the classical part,
•β:H´ et(1)→H◦is a homomorphism of classical p-divisible groups called
theKato monodromy map ofH.
LetHµbe the multiplicative part of H◦, thenβfactors through Hµand we de-
note the resulting map H´ et(1)→Hµstill asβ, by abuse of notation. The map6 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
β:H´ et(1)→Hµcorresponds to a pairing
c(H):Tp(H´ et)⊗Tp((Hµ)∗)→Zp,
which we call the Kato monodromy pairing ofH(see Deﬁnition 5.18).
Now consider the generic ﬁber HKofH. Grothendieck’s theory of panach´ ee
extensions furnishes a pairing
cGr(HK):Tp(H´ et)⊗Tp((Hµ)∗)→Zp
toHKor equivalently to H, which we call the Grothendieck monodromy pairing of
HKor equivalently of H(see Deﬁnition 5.18).
Our next main theorem compares c(H) withcGr(H) (see Theorem 5.15).
Theorem E.For anyH∈BTlog
S,dwe have c(H) =cGr(HK).
Assume further that OKsatisﬁes the assumption ( ∗). In the equivalence tri-
angle (1.1), it seems that there is no monodromy associated to the o bjects of
Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK). However, consider the functors
Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK)
V( )/d47/d47Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK)≃
Dst/d47/d47Ma,{−1,0},
where
•the functor V( ) is given by T/mapsto→T⊗ZpQp,
•Madenotesthe categoryofadmissible ﬁltered( ϕ,N)-modules over K(see
[5,§4.1]), and Ma,{−1,0}denotes the full subcategory of Maconsisting of
objectsDsuch that Fil−1DK=DKand Fil1DK= 0,
•the functor Dst:Repst
Qp(GK)→Maassociating Dst(V) from (2.3) to
V∈RepQp(GK) is an exact tensor equivalence by [ 5, Prop. 4.2] and it
clearly restricts to an equivalence Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK)≃− →Ma,{−1,0}.
For anyT∈Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK), if we pass to Ma,{−1,0}along the two functors V( )
andDst, we havethe K0-linearendomorphism NontheK0-vectorspace Dst(V(T))
and we call NtheFontaine monodromy map ofT.
GivenH∈BTlog
S,d, our last main theorem compares the Kato monodromy map
βofHwith the Fontaine monodromy map of Vp(H) =V(Tp(H)) (see Theorem
6.14 and the paragraph after its proof).
Theorem F.Assume that OKsatisﬁesthe assumption( ∗) and let H∈BTlog
S,d.
Then the Kato monodromy map βofHdetermines the Fontaine monodromy map
ofTp(H), and vice versa rationally.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we rapidly introduce notations
and cite results in the literature that lead to the proof of Theorem A . Before
generalizing this result to the logarithmic context, we recall in Sectio n 3 results onLOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 7
logp-divisible groups. A useful technical lemma on panach´ ee extension s is proved
in Section 4. The proof of Theorem B starts with Section 5 and ends in Section
6.3. Corollaries C and D are proved in Section 6.4. Finally Theorems E and F on
monodromy are proved in Sections 5.3 and 6.5, respectively.
2. Details on the classical case
In this section we assume that OKsatisﬁes (∗), and give some details on The-
orem A and its proof. Also, we introduce notation used later.
ForH∈BTOK, letTp(H) :=Tp(HK) andVp(H) :=Vp(HK). Since Kis of
characteristic 0, the functors
Tp:BTK→RepZp(GK) andVp:BTK⊗Q→RepQp(GK)
are equivalences of categories. Then by Tate’s Theorem (see [ 26, Thm. 4]) the
functors
Tp:BTOK→RepZp(GK) andVp:BTOK⊗Q→RepQp(GK)
are fully faithful. It is a natural question to ask what the essential images of the
last two functors are. The answer needs Fontaine’s period rings.
LetBcrisbe the ring of crystalline periods and let Bst=Bcris[u] be the ring
of log-crystalline periods, where u= log[p♭] withp♭= (p,p1/p,···) (see [5]). Both
rings are endowed with an action of Frobenius ϕand a decreasing ﬁltration. Fur-
thermore, Bstis endowed with a unique Bcris-derivation Nsuch that N(u) =−1,
called the monodromy operator . For any T∈RepZp(GK), set
(2.1) V(T) :=T⊗ZpQp,
and consider the ﬁltered ϕ-module (resp. ﬁltered ( ϕ,N)-module)
(2.2) Dcris(T) :=Dcris(V(T)) := (V(T)⊗QpBcris)GK,
(2.3) (resp. Dst(T) :=Dst(V(T)) := (V(T)⊗QpBst)GK).
AZp-representation TofGKis called crystalline (resp.semistable ) if
dimQpV(T) = dim K0Dcris(T) ( resp. dim QpV(T) = dim K0Dst(T)),
and we denote the full subcategory of RepZp(GK) consisting of crystalline (resp.
semistable) representations by Repcris
Zp(GK) (resp.Repst
Zp(GK)). Note that a crys-
talline representation is automatically semistable, in other words Repcris
Zp(GK) is a
full subcategory of Repst
Zp(GK). Let•=Zp,Qp. We have the following diagram of
subcategories
Repst,{0,1}
•(GK)⊂Repst
•(GK)⊂Rep•(GK)⊂ ⊂Repcris,{0,1}
•(GK)⊂Repcris
•(GK),8 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
whereRepcris,{0,1}
•(GK) (resp. Repst,{0,1}
•(GK)) denotes the full subcategory of
Repcris
•(GK) (resp. Repst
•(GK)) consisting of objects with Hodge-Tate weights in
{0,1}.
Theorem A in the Introduction section answers the aforementione d question.
Forp= 2, the theorem is simply a reformulation of [ 19, Thm. 2.2.1], attributed
in loc. cit. to Fontaine, Kisin, Raynaud and Tate. For completeness, we present
below a full proof of Theorem A. It imitates the proof of [ 19, Thm. 2.2.1] and
basically it collects some famous results from the literature.
Proof of Theorem A . We only need to treat the case of Tp. By Tate’s the-
orem [26,§4.2, Cor. 1], the functor Tpis fully faithful. By Fontaine’s theorem
[10,§6.2], the image of the functor Tplands in Repcris
Zp(GK). It further lands in
Repcris,{0,1}
Zp(GK) by Tate’s theorem [ 26,§4, Cor. 2 on p. 180]. We are left with
showing that the essential image of TpisRepcris,{0,1}
Zp(GK).
LetTbe an object in Repcris,{0,1}
Zp(GK). By Raynaud’s theorem [ 24, Prop.
2.3.1], it suﬃces to show that T/pnTregarded as a ﬁnite group scheme over K
extends to a ﬁnite ﬂat group scheme over OKfor each n. Note that there exists
H∈BTOKsuch that T⊗ZpQp∼=Vp(H), and we regard Tas a lattice inside Vp(H)
with respect to this isomorphism. The existence of such His due to Breuil when
p≥3 andk⊂Fp(see [2, Thm. 1.4]), and due to Kisin for the rest cases (see [ 17,
Cor. 2.2.6]). We are going to use Hto produce the aforementioned integral models.
Leta,b∈Nsuch that pa+bTp(H)⊂paT⊂Tp(H). Then we have a diagram of
ﬁniteGK-modules, that is, ﬁnite ´ etale group schemes over K,
T/pnT∼=paT/pa+nTα− →Tp(H)/pa+nTβ← −Tp(H)/pa+b+nTp(H)∼=(Ha+b+n)K
withα(resp.β) injective (resp. surjective). By [ 24,§2.1], ker( β) extends to a ﬁnite
ﬂat group scheme NoverOK, and thus the ﬁnite ﬂat group scheme Ha+b+n/N
extendsTp(H)/pa+nT. Applying [ 24,§2.1] once again, we see that T/pnTalso
extends to a ﬁnite ﬂat group scheme over OK. We are done.
3. General results
This section mainly contains known results that will be used in the next sec-
tions.
3.1. Log p-divisible groups. In this subsection, we introduce Kato’s theory
of logp-divisible groups, which is developed in [ 15]. In the following, log structures
are deﬁned by sheaves of monoids for the ´ etale topology.
LetSbe an fs log scheme whose underlying scheme ˚Sis locally noetherian,
and let (fs /S) be the category of fs log schemes over S. We endow (fs /S) with the
Kummer log ﬂat topology (cf. [ 16,§2] and [22,§2]), and denote the resulting site
by (fs/S)kﬂ. Sometimes, we abbreviate (fs /S)kﬂasSkﬂto shorten the formulas.LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 9
Similarly, (fs /S)ﬂdenotesthe category(fs /S)with the classicalﬂattopology(fppf).
These two sites are denoted as Slog
ﬂandScl
ﬂrespectively in [ 15].
Definition 3.1.LetAbkﬂ(S) denote the categoryof sheavesof abelian groups
over (fs/S)kﬂ. We deﬁne (ﬁn /S)ras the full subcategory of Abkﬂ(S) consisting of
objectsFwhich are representable by an fs log scheme f:F→Ssuch that the
structure morphism fis Kummer log ﬂat and the underlying map of schemes is
ﬁnite. We call an object of (ﬁn /S)raﬁnite Kummer log ﬂat group log scheme , or
simply a ﬁnite kﬂ group log scheme .
Note that F∈(ﬁn/S)rwithF→Sstrict is just a classical ﬁnite ﬂat group
scheme over ˚Sendowed with the log structure induced from S. We denote the full
subcategory consisting of such objects by (ﬁn /S)c. LetGmbe the multiplicative
group endowed with the induced log structure. For F∈(ﬁn/S)r, theCartier dual
ofFis the sheaf
F∗:=HomSkfl(F,Gm).
The category (ﬁn /S)dis the full subcategory of (ﬁn /S)rconsisting of objects F
withF∗∈(ﬁn/S)r.
Definition 3.2.Alogp-divisible group (or alog Barsotti-Tate group ) overS
is an object HofAbkﬂ(S) satisfying:
(a)H= lim−→nHnwithHn:= ker(pn:H→H);
(b)p:H→His surjective;
(c)Hn∈(ﬁn/S)rfor anyn >0.
We denote the category of log p-divisible groups over SbyBTlog
S,r. We deﬁne
full subcategories
(3.3) BTlog
S,c⊆BTlog
S,d⊆BTlog
S,r
by:H∈BTlog
S,d(resp.H∈BTlog
S,c), ifHn∈(ﬁn/S)d(resp.Hn∈(ﬁn/S)c) for
n≥1. We call the objects of BTlog
S,dthedual representable log p-divisible groups .
ClearlyH∈BTlog
S,camounts to a classical p-divisible group over ˚S.
Recall that given a short exact sequence 0 →H′→H→H′′→0 inAbkﬂ(S),
ifH′,H′′are dual representable log p-divisible groups, the same is H(cf. [15,
Prop. 2.3]). Furthermore, the exactness of a sequence of log p-divisible groups is
equivalent to the exactness of the sequences of kernels of multiplic ation by pnfor
one (equivalently all) n >0.
3.2. Kato monodromy. In this subsection, we assume that the underlying
schemeof Sis˚S= Spec(A)withAanoetherianhenselianlocalring. Let k=A/mA
andp:= char(k)>0. Suppose further that the log structure MSofSadmits a
chartγ:PS→M SwithPan fs monoid, and that γinduces an isomorphism
P=PS,¯s∼− →M S,¯s/O×
S,¯s, where ¯sdenotes a geometric point above the closed point
sof Spec(A) and thus O×
S,¯s= (Ash)×, withAshthe strict henselization of A.10 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
Remark 3.4.Note that the assumption on the chart γimplies that the canoni-
cal mapMS,s/O×
S,s∼− →M S,¯s/O×
S,¯sis an isomorphism, where ( −)sdenotes the stalk
for the Zariski topology at sand by abuse of notation MSalso denotes the restric-
tionMS,zarofMSto the small Zariski site of S. In fact, let η:S´ et→Szardenote
the canonical map of small sites; the existence of the global chart γimplies that
η∗MS,zar∼− →M Sby [23, Ch. III, Prop. 1.4.1.2]. Then for any ´ etale neighborhood
(U,u) ofs, the restriction of MSto the small Zariski site of Uis just the inverse
image ofMS,zaralongU→S, thereforeMS,s/O×
S,s∼− →M U,u/O×
U,uby [23, Ch.
III, Rmk. 1.1.6]. In particular, we get MS,s/O×
S,s∼− →M S,¯s/O×
S,¯s. Therefore, the
requirement P∼− →M S,¯s/O×
S,¯sis equivalent to requiring P∼− →M S,s/O×
S,s.
The torsion subgroups of an object of BTlog
S,dlie in (ﬁn /S)d, and the following
theorem of Kato describes an object F∈(ﬁn/S)das an extension of classical ﬁnite
ﬂat group schemes.
Proposition 3.5 (Kato, [ 15]).LetF∈(ﬁn/S)rand letF◦be the connected
component of Fthat contains the image of the identity section. Then
(a)F◦∈(ﬁn/S)c.
(b)F´ et:=F/F◦∈(ﬁn/S)r.
(c) Assume that Fis killed by a power of p. ThenF∈(ﬁn/S)dif and only
ifF´ et∈(ﬁn/S)c. If this is the case, then F´ etis classically ´ etale over S.
As a consequence, to understand objects of BTlog
S,d, we ﬁrst need to under-
stand the extensions of a classical ﬁnite ´ etale group scheme by a c lassical ﬁnite ﬂat
group scheme in the category Abkﬂ(S) or, equivalently, in (ﬁn /S)rsince the latter
subcategory is closed by extensions (see [ 15, Prop. 2.3]).
LetF′,F′′∈(ﬁn/S)cand ﬁx a positive integer nthat kills both F′andF′′.
We assume F′′´ etale and write F′′(1) :=F′′⊗Z/nZZ/nZ(1) where Z/nZ(1) denotes
the Cartier dual of Z/nZ. Let
EXTSkfl(F′′,F′) (resp. EXT Sfl(F′′,F′))
denote the category of extensions of F′′byF′in (fs/S)kﬂand (fs/S)ﬂ, respectively.
Let
HOM(F′′(1),F′)⊗ZPgp
denote the discrete category associated with the set Hom S(F′′(1),F′)⊗ZPgp. The
functor Φ 1: EXT Sfl(F′′,F′)→EXTSkfl(F′′,F′),Fcl/mapsto→Fcl, extends to a functor
(3.6) Φ = Φ γ: EXT Sfl(F′′,F′)×HOM(F′′(1),F′)⊗ZPgp→EXTSkfl(F′′,F′),
deﬁned as
Φ(Fcl,β) :=Fcl+BaerΦ2(β)
where + Baerdenotes the Baer sum and the functor
(3.7) Φ 2= Φ2,γ: HOM(F′′(1),F′)⊗ZPgp→EXTSkfl(F′′,F′), β/mapsto→Φ2(β),
is constructed as follows.LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 11
Fora∈Pgp, letMadenote the log 1-motive
[Zua−→Gm,log], ua(1) =a,
whereGm,logis Kato’s logarithmic multiplicative group on (fs /S)kﬂ(see [16, Thm.
3.2]). Then Ea,n:=H−1(Ma⊗L
ZZ/nZ) ﬁts into a short exact sequence
(3.8) 0 →Z/nZ(1)→Ea,n→Z/nZ→0,

exact sequence

one deﬁnes Φ 2(β)∈EXTSkfl(F′′,F′) as the Baer sum of the extensions Φ 2(νi⊗ai).
Theorem 3.10 (Kato) .The functor Φγin(3.6)is an equivalence of categories.
Proof. See [15, Thm. 3.3] or [ 27, Thm. 3.8]. /square
Clearly, the construction of the functor Φ 2(3.7) involves the chosen chart γ
and therefore the functor Φ depends on the chosen chart of S. However, once the
chart is ﬁxed, Φ( Fcl
1,β1)≃Φ(Fcl
2,β2) if and only if β1=β2andFcl
1≃Fcl
2. In
particular, the following deﬁnition makes sense.
Definition 3.11.LetF∈EXTSkfl(F′′,F′). Theβ∈HOM(F′′(1),F′)⊗ZPgp
corresponding to Fguaranteed by Theorem 3.10 is called the Kato monodromy of
the extension FofF′′byF′. ForF∈(ﬁn/S)d, theKato monodromy ofFis
deﬁned to be the Kato monodromy of Fas an extension of F´ etbyF◦. IfPgp≃Z,
βis called the Kato monodromy map .
We can prove more: once ﬁxed Fin EXT Skfl(F′′,F′), the Kato monodromy of
Fis essentially independent of the chart chosen on S, as explained in the result
here below.
Lemma3.12.Letγ′:P′
S→MSbe another chart. Assume that it induces an
isomorphism γ′
¯s:P′∼− →M S,¯s/O×
S,¯s, and set g=γ′−1
¯s◦γ¯s:P∼− →P′. Letβ′denote
the Kato monodromy of the extension FinEXTSkfl(F′′,F′)with respect to γ′, and
letggpbe the group envelope of g. Then
(id⊗ggp): HOM( F′′(1),F′)⊗ZPgp→HOM(F′′(1),F′)⊗ZP′gp
maps the Kato monodromy βofFconstructed via the chart γto the Kato mon-
odromyβ′constructed using γ′.
Proof. Note that γ′◦gS, γ:PS→MSare morphisms of sheaves of monoids
that induce the same map P→MS,¯s/O×
S,¯s. Therefore, by Remark 3.4, ( γ′◦g)−
γ:P→Mgp

S, that is, Ea,n−Ea′,n∈EXTSfl(F′′,F′). In particular, Φ 2,γ(ν⊗a)−Φ2,γ′(ν⊗

consequence, if β=/summationtext

ofFwith respect to γ′is (id⊗ggp)(/summationtext

Corollary 3.13.IfP=P′=N, the Kato monodromy map does not depend
on the chart.
Proof. Clearly, the only possible automorphism of the monoid Nis identity.

Now, we recall the analogous result for log p-divisible groups. Let H′=
lim−→nH′
n,H′′= lim−→nH′′
nbe two objects in BTlog
S,c(i.e., classical p-divisible groups),
and assume that H′′is ´ etale. Let us denote by
EXTSkfl(H′′,H′) (resp. EXT Sfl(H′′,H′))
the category of extensions of H′′byH′inBTlog
S,r(resp. in BTlog
S,c), and by
HOM(H′′(1),H′)⊗ZPgp
the discrete category associated with the set Hom S(H′′(1),H′)⊗ZPgp, where
H′′(1) := lim−→nH′′
n⊗Z/pnZZ/pnZ(1).
Let
Hcl= lim−→nHcl
n∈EXTSfl(H′′,H′),
andβ∈HOM(H′′(1),H′)⊗ZPgp. The element βinduces a compatible system
{βn∈HOM(H′′
n(1),H′
n)⊗ZPgp}n.
We apply the functor (3.6) to the pair ( Hcl
n,βn) for each n≥1 and write Φn
γ(resp.
Φn
2,γ) in place of Φ γ(resp. Φ 2,γ) in order to indicate its dependence on n. Then
we get a compatible system {Φn

Note that since Hcl

and Φ 2,γ(β) := lim−→nΦn
2,γ(βn) is an object of BTlog

γ(Hcl
n,βn) by Φ γ(Hcl,β). The association of
Φγ(Hcl,β) to the pair ( Hcl,β) gives rise to a functor
(3.14) Φ = Φ γ: EXT Sfl(H′′,H′)×HOM(H′′(1),H′)⊗ZPgp→EXTSkfl(H′′,H′).
Theorem 3.15 (Kato) .LetSbe as above. Assume that there exists a global
chartγ:PS→MSsuch that the induced map P→MS,¯s/O×

LetH′,H′′∈BTlog

Φγ: EXT Sfl(H′′,H′)×HOM(H′′(1),H′)⊗ZPgp→EXTSkfl(H′′,H′)
in(3.14)is an equivalence of categories.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 3.10. /square
As in the ﬁnite case, we have a notion of monodromy.
Definition 3.16.Given an object Hof EXT Skfl(H′′,H′), we call the β∈
HOM(H′′(1),H′)⊗ZPgpcorresponding to Hguaranteed by Theorem 3.15 the
Kato monodromy of the extension H. If, furthermore, Pgp≃Zwe call it Kato
monodromy map .
3.2.1.Discrete valued base. Now, let S= Spec OKequipped with the canonical
log structure. We ﬁx a uniformizer πofOK, and thus ﬁx a chart P:=N→
Γ(S,MS),1/mapsto→π, which satisﬁes the condition in Theorem 3.15. For H∈BTlog
S,d,
letH◦(resp.Hµ) be the connected (resp. multiplicative) subgroup of H. As
explained in [ 27,§3.2], they are classical p-divisible groups, and we have a short
exact sequence
(3.17) 0 →H◦→H→H´ et→0,

monodromy βofHfactors as H´ et(1)→Hµ֒→H◦, and, if no confusion arises, we

by Corollary 3.13, the Kato monodromy map βdoes not depend on the chart.
3.3. Kummer log ﬂat cohomology. LetSbe an fs logschemewhoseunder-
lying scheme is locally noetherian. Let (fs /S)ﬂbe theclassical ﬂat site on (fs/S),
i.e., a covering{fi:Ui→U}iof an fs log scheme UoverSis a set-theoretic cover-
ing where the morphisms fiare strict and their underlying morphisms of schemes
are ﬂat and locally of ﬁnite presentation [ 16,§4]. We have a forgetful map of sites:
ε: (fs/S)kﬂ→(fs/S)ﬂ.14 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
In order to understand the cohomology on (fs /S)kﬂ, one needs to understand the
higherdirectimages Riε∗. Thefollowingtwotheoremswillbeusefulforourpurpose
in this paper. For more results on Riε∗we refer to [ 29].
Theorem 3.19.[16, Theorem 4.1] LetGbe a commutative group scheme that
is either ﬁnite ﬂat or smooth aﬃne over the underlying scheme ofS. Then, we
have
R1ε∗G≃lim−→nHomS(Z/nZ(1),G)⊗(Gm,log/Gm),
where the quotient Gm,log/Gmis taken in (fs/S)ﬂ.
Theorem 3.20.[29, Theorem 2.3] IfGis a torus, then we have
(a)R2ε∗G≃lim−→n(R2ǫ∗G)[n] =/circleplustext
ℓ(R2ǫ∗G)[ℓ∞], where ℓvaries over all
prime numbers;
(b)(R2ε∗G)[ℓr]is supported on the locus where the prime ℓis invertible;
(c) ifnis invertible on S, then
(R2ε∗G)[n]≃G[n](−2)⊗∧2(Gm,log/Gm).
The following example will be used later.
Example 3.21.LetRbe a strictly henselian discrete valuation ring with frac-
tion ﬁeld Kand letS= SpecRequipped with the canonical log structure. Let H
denote both a ﬁnite abelian group and the associated constant gro up scheme over
R, and let H∗be its Cartier dual. For any resolution of H
0→Zrα− →Zr→H→0
by free abelian groupsofﬁnite rank, we get a shortexact sequenc e ofgroup schemes
0→H∗→Gr
m→Gr
m→0.
Applying ε∗to this sequence, we get a long exact sequence
···→(R1ε∗Gm)rβ− →(R1ε∗Gm)r→R2ε∗H∗→(R2ε∗Gm)r.
By Theorem 3.19, we have R1ε∗Gm≃(Q/Z)⊗Z(Gm,log/Gm) and the morphism β
is just ˇα⊗ZIdGm,log/Gm, where ˇαdenotes the Pontryagin dual of α. Therefore, βis
surjective. Let (st /S) be the full subcategory of (fs /S) consisting of fs log schemes
overSwhose structure map to Sis strict, and denote by (st /S)ﬂthe classical
ﬂat site on (st /S). Then, for any U∈(st/S) and any point uofU, the stalk of
Gm,log/Gmat ¯uis either 0 or Z, where ¯uis a geometric point above u. Thus, the
restriction of∧2(Gm,log/Gm) to (st/S)ﬂis zero. By Theorem 3.20, the restriction
ofR2ε∗Gmto (st/S)ﬂis zero. Therefore, the restriction of R2ε∗H∗to (st/S)ﬂis
also zero. Then the Leray spectral sequence

ﬂ(S,Gm) =

´ et(S,Gm) = 0 for j >0, and thus
(3.23) Hi
ﬂ(S,H∗) = 0 for i >1.
Then the exact sequence (3.22) gives us an exact sequence

(3.24)H2
kﬂ(S,H∗)≃H1
ﬂ(S,ˇH⊗Z(Gm,log/Gm))≃H1
´ et(S,ˇH⊗Z(Gm,log/Gm)) = 0.
We are left to compute H1
kﬂ(S,H∗). Note that the restriction map
H1
kﬂ(S,H∗)→H1

which can also be induced by the split short exact sequence

The panach´ ee extensions of a panchable sequence SinCform a category
(indeed, a groupoid) that we denote as EXTPAN C(S). It follows immediately
from the exact sequence
···→Ext1
C(D5,D2)→Ext1
C(D5,D3)→Ext2
C(D5,D1)
that EXTPAN C(S) is not empty if and only if the Yoneda product
(3.29) c(S) :=D2·D4∈Ext2
C(D5,D1)
is trivial. Further, the automorphism group of an object Din EXTPAN C(S) is
(3.30) Hom( D,D)≃Hom C(D5,D1),
where the left most Hom means morphisms as panach´ ee extensions . Finally, by
[14, Expos´ e IX, Prop. 9.3.8], the set ExtpanC(S) of isomorphism classes of objects
in EXTPAN C(S) is a torsor under Ext1
C(D5,D1) with the action given by
ω: Ext1
C(D5,D1)×ExtpanC(S)→ExtpanC(S) (3.31)
([E],[D])/mapsto→j∗[E]+Baer[D]
where the Baer sum is taken as extension classes of D5byD2.

The main result of this section is Lemma 4.8 comparing panach´ ee exte nsion in
diﬀerent categories. Let S:= Spec OKequipped with the canonical log structure.
Let (Sch/K) be the category of schemes over K, and let (Sch /K)ﬂdenote the ﬂat
site on (Sch /K). Let Ckﬂ(resp. Cﬂ, resp. CK) be the abelian category of sheavesof
Z/pnZ-modules on the site Skﬂ= (fs/S)kﬂ(resp.Sﬂ= (fs/S)ﬂ, resp. (Sch /K)ﬂ).
Throughout this section S= (Dµ,...,D´ et) denotes a panachable sequence in

Assume that there exists a panach´ ee extension of SKinCK; then the horizontal
functor is an equivalence of categories and any panach´ ee ex tension ofSKextends
to a unique (up to unique isomorphism) panach´ ee extension o fSinCkﬂ.
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is immediate. Now assume that there exists a
panach´ ee extension DKofSKinCK. We claim that EXTPAN Ckfl(S) is not empty.
The obstruction to the existence of panach´ ee extensions of SinCkﬂis given by the
classc(S)∈Ext2
Ckfl(D´ et,Dµ)≃H2
kﬂ(S,L) withL=HomS(D´ et,Dµ); see (3.29)
and (4.5).
Claim: There exists a ﬁnite Galois unramiﬁed ﬁeld extension K′ofKsuch that
c(S) becomes zero in H2
kﬂ(S′,L), where S′is the spectrum of the ring of integers of
K′and we endow it with the canonical log structure. Let 0 →L→L1→L2→0
be the canonical smooth resolution of L, see [21, Thm. A.5]. Since Hj
ﬂ(S,Li)∼=
Hj
´ et(S,Li) for any j, we get an exact sequence
H1
´ et(S,L2)→H2
ﬂ(S,L)→H2
´ et(S,L1).
This exact sequence together with the second part of (3.22) and H1
ﬂ(S,R1ε∗L)∼=
H1
´ et(S,R1ε∗L) (see [25, Tag 0DDU]), give us the claim.
By the claim, we have c(S)∈H2
kﬂ(S,L)S′. If necessary, we enlarge K′so
thatD´ etand (Dµ)∗become constant over K′as in the proof of Lemma 4.7. Since
c(SK) = 0, by hypothesis, and the map θ5in the proof of Lemma 4.7 is an iso-
morphism, we have c(S) = 0. We can then ﬁx a panach´ ee extension DofSin
Ckﬂ.
Now, we prove that g−1

gives a bijection

1induces a
bijection
(4.10) ExtpanCkfl(S)∼−→ExtpanCK(SK), j∗[E]+[D]/mapsto→j∗[EK]+[DK].
In particular, the functor g−1
1in (4.9) is essentially surjective.
We now prove that g−1
1is fully faithful. First, note that any automorphism of
DKextends uniquely to an automorphism of D; in fact, by (3.30) and [ 21, Chapter20 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO

(4.11) Hom( D,D)≃HomS(D´ et,Dµ)≃HomSpec(K)(D´ et,Dµ)≃Hom(DK,DK).

(4.11) and the vertical ones are bijections since γandγKare isomorphisms. There-
fore, the lower one is also bijective and the full faithfulness of g−1

We conclude this section with a technical result that will be useful in t he study
of monodromy pairings.

(c) Since OKis strictly henselian, both D´ etand (Dµ)∗are constant, ﬁnite rank

5. Logp-divisible groups and p-divisible groups with sst reduction
The main result of this section is Theorem 5.19, that is part (a) ofour Theorem
B; wefurther showthat the genericﬁber functor respectsmono dromy(see Theorem
5.15).
LetS:= Spec OKequipped with the canonical log structure. Let HKbe a
p-divisible group over K. We say that HKhasgood reduction if it extends to
ap-divisible group over OK. In this section, we will apply several times Tate’s
theorem [ 26, Thm. 4] in case char( K) = 0 and de Jong’s theorem [ 6, Cor. 1.2]
in case char( K)>0 stating that the generic ﬁber functor on p-divisible groups is
fully faithful. We have the following deﬁnition of semistable reduction o fp-divisible
groups following de Jong [ 6, 2.2 Deﬁnition].
Definition 5.1.LetHKbe ap-divisible group over K. We say that HKhas
semistable reduction if there exists a ﬁltration 0 ⊆Hµ
K⊆Hf
K⊆HKsuch that
(a)Hf
K(resp.HK/Hµ
K) extends to a p-divisible group H†(resp.H‡) over
OK;
(b) under the condition ( a), the morphism Hf

amorphism f:H†→H‡ofp-divisiblegroupsover OKwithHµ:= Ker(f)
a multiplicative p-divisible group and H´ et:= Coker( f) an´ etale p-divisible

Thep-divisible groups H†,H‡are denoted as H1,H2in [6]. We have changed
the numbering to avoid a conﬂict of notation with the torsion subgro ups ofH.
5.1. The canonical ﬁltration. As stated in [ 6, 2.4 Lemma (i)] any HKas
aboveadmitsa canonical ﬁltration , i.e., aﬁltrationwhere H´ etisthe´ etalequotientof
H‡andHµis the multiplicative part of H†, which is then connected. Its existence
and uniqueness are guaranteed by the lemma below.
Lemma 5.3.LetHKbe ap-divisible group over Kwith semistable reduction.
ThenHKadmits a canonical ﬁltration 0⊆Hµ
K⊆Hf
K⊆HKand for any other
ﬁltration 0⊆H′µ
K⊆H′f
K⊆HKas in Deﬁnition 5.1 we have H†is isomorphic to
the connected component of H′†. In particular, the canonical ﬁltration is unique.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove the existence of a canonical ﬁltration by “extractin g”
it from any ﬁltration 0 ⊆Hµ
K⊆Hf
K⊆HKas in Deﬁnition 5.1. If H†is not
connected, we consider the generic ﬁber of ( H†)◦in place of Hf

K⊆HKis canonical by construction. The
horizontal and vertical sequences in (5.5) are short exact seque nces ofp-divisible
groups, since BTOKis closed by extensions [ 20, I, (2.4.3)].
Let now 0⊆Hµ
K⊆Hf
K⊆HKbe a canonical ﬁltration and 0 ⊆H′µ
K⊆H′f
K⊆
HKa ﬁltration as in the statement of the lemma. Then the composition of the

[26, Thm. 4] in case char( K) = 0 and [ 6, Cor. 1.2] in case char( K)>0, and hence
Hf
K⊆H′f
K. The inclusion Hf
K⊆H′f
Kcorresponds to a map H†→H′†. SinceH†LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 23
is connected, the map H†→H′†factors through ( H′†)◦֒→H′†. Thus we actually
haveHf
K⊆(H′†)◦
K⊆H′f
K. Similarly the composition ( H′†)◦
K→HK→H´ et
K
is the 0 map, and thus ( H′†)◦
K⊆Hf

K=Hf
K, and thus
H†≃− →(H′†)◦by [26, Cor. 2] and its positive characteristic analogue. /square
5.2. From semistable reduction to log p-divisible groups. LetHKbe
ap-divisible group with semistable reduction and ﬁx a ﬁltration Hµ
K⊆Hf
K⊆HK
andp-divisible groups H†,H‡as in Deﬁnition 5.1. For any n, we have a panachable
sequence
(5.6)SK,n= (Hµ
K,n, Hf
K,n, Hf
K,n/Hµ

n) (5.7)
inCkﬂ(or in Cﬂ). Restricting diagrams (5.2) to the pn-torsion subgroups, we see
thatHK,nhas a structure of panach´ ee extension of SK,ninCK, in particular,
the category EXTPAN CK(SK,n) is not empty. Hence, we can apply the results of
Section 4 and extend HKto a logp-divisible group.
Lemma 5.8.LetHKbe ap-divisible group with semistable reduction. The
following holds.
(a) The Cartier dual H∗
K:= lim−→nHom(HK,n,µpn)ofHKhas semistable re-
duction.
(b) LetSK,nandSst
nbe the panachable sequences attached to a ﬁltration of
HKas in(5.6)and(5.7). The panach´ ee extension HK,nofSK,nextends
to a unique (up to unique isomorphism) panach´ ee extension HnofSst
nin
CkﬂandHn∈(ﬁn/S)d.
(c) For any positive integers mandn, the inclusion HK,n֒→HK,m+nextends
to a unique inclusion Hn→Hm+n.
(d)H:= lim−→nHnis an object in BTlog
S,dthat extends HKand is independent
of the chosen ﬁltration.
(e) The canonical ﬁltration of HKis0⊆(Hµ)K⊆(H◦)K⊆HKwithHµ
the multiplicative part of the log p-divisible group Hin (d) and H◦its
connected part.
Proof. (a) Applying Cartier duality ()∗to both diagrams in (5.2), we see
thatH∗
Kcomes equipped with a ﬁltration
0⊆H∗,µ
K⊆H∗,f
K⊆H∗
K,
whereH∗,µ
K:= (H´ et)∗
KandH∗,f
K:= (H‡)∗
K. Hence, the p-divisible group H∗
Kover
Khas semistable reduction.
(b) By Lemma 4.8 HK,nextends to a unique (up to unique isomorphism)
panach´ ee extension HnofSst
ninCkﬂ. Note that Hnis an extension of H´ et
nbyH†
n
and hence it lies in (ﬁn /S)rby [16, Thm. 9.1]. By applying Cartier duality in24 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
(5.2) and taking the pn-torsion subgroups, we see that the Cartier dual H∗
nofHn
is a panach´ ee extension of (( H´ et)∗
n,(H‡)∗
n,...,(H†)∗
n,(Hµ
n)∗) and it extends H∗
K,n
by the uniqueness statement in Lemma 4.8. It follows that Hn∈(ﬁn/S)d.
(c) Since Ker( pn:Hm+n→Hm+n) restrictsto the panach´ eeextensionof HK,n,
it agrees with Hnby Lemma 4.8.
(d) It follows from (b) and the proof of (c) that Hsatisﬁes conditions (a) and
(c) in Deﬁnition 3.2. For the surjectivity of the multiplication by p, note that His
an extension of the classical p-divisible group H´ etoverSbyH†. Furthermore, H
sits in the middle of a diagram

H´ etH´ et
where rows and columns are exact sequences of log p-divisible groups; we view it
as a compatible system of diagrams on the p-power torsion subsheaves in Ckﬂ. For
the independence statement, it suﬃces to retrace the proof of L emma 5.3. Then
diagram (5.4) and the uniqueness statement in (b) say that Hremains the same if
we replace the datum of Hµ,H†,H‡,H´ etwithHµ,H†,◦,H‡,H‡,´ et. On the other
hand, diagram (5.5) and the uniqueness statement in (b) say that Hremains the
same if we replace the datum of Hµ,H†,◦,H‡,H‡,´ etwithH†,µ,H†,◦,(H‡)′,H‡,´ et.
HenceHis isomorphic to the p-divisible group in BTlog
S,dconstructed using the
canonical ﬁltration.
The proof of (e) is immediate since (3.17) extends the vertical sequ ence in the
middle of the leftmost diagram in (5.2) for the canonical ﬁltration. /square
5.3. Monodromy pairings. LetHKbe ap-divisible group with semistable
reduction and Hthe logp-divisible group that extends HK(see Lemma 5.8). Let
SK,n= (Hµ
K,n,H◦
K,n,...,H´ et
K,n) be the panachable sequence (5.6) constructed from
the canonical ﬁltration, and let Sst
n= (Hµ

CkﬂandCﬂ. Inthissectionwestudythreepairings H´ et

We will show that they agree.LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 25
The ﬁrst pairing was constructed in [ 14, Expos´ e IX, (9.5.4)] via Galois descent
from the strictly henselian case. We present an alternative direct c onstruction
below.
Recall that πis a ﬁxed uniformizer of OKand the ﬁxed chart on SisNS→
MS,1/mapsto→π. By Theorem 3.10, and Section 3.2.1, the level n-part of the log p-
divisible group His (as element in EXT Skfl(H´ et

for some Hcl
n∈EXTSfl(H´ et
n,H◦
n) and some βn∈HomS(H´ et
n(1),H◦
n), called Kato
monodromy map. By construction, the extension Φn
2(βn) is the push-out along βn
of the sequence (3.9) with F′′=H´ et
n. Sinceβnfactors through a map
βµ
n:H´ et
n(1)→Hµ

the extension Φn
2(βn) is also the push-out of an extension Hβ

The map δis surjective by [ 27, App. D, Prop. D.1 (2)]. We identify H0(S,R1ε∗L)

induced by the isomorphism α, the logarithmic monodromy pairing is mapped to
the Kato monodromy map. Therefore, the logarithmic monodromy p airing agrees
with the Kato monodromy pairing. /square

Similarly one deﬁnes the Grothendieck monodromy pairing cGr(HK) by passing to
the inverse limit on cGr(HK,n).
Note that by Theorem 5.15 c(H) andcGr(HK) are the same pairing.
5.4. Criterion for semistable reduction of p-divisible groups.
Theorem 5.19.There is an equivalence of categories
BTlog
S,d→BTst
K, H/mapsto→H×SSpecK.
Proof. LetH∈BTlog
S,d. ThenHn→Sis Kummer. Since the log structure
ofSis supported on the closed point, the map Hn×SSpecK→SpecKhas to
be strict. It follows that H×SSpecKis a classical p-divisible group over Kand
hence, we have a functor
( )K:BTlog
S,d→BTK, H/mapsto→H×SSpecK.
It remains to prove that this functor is fully faithful with essential imageBTst
K.
We determine the image of the functor. In the connected-´ etale d ecomposition
(3.17) of HbothH◦andH´ etlie inBTlog
S,c, andH◦(resp.H´ et) is connected (resp.
´ etale) (see [ 15, Prop. 2.7 (3)] or [ 27, Prop. 3.9]). Let Hµ⊂H◦be the maxi-
mal multiplicative p-divisible subgroup of H◦. Now the connected log p-divisible
group (H/Hµ)◦overShas trivial multiplicative subgroup; hence, the monodromy
morphism associated with H/Hµin Kato’s classiﬁcation of log p-divisible groups
must be trivial (see [ 27, Cor. 3.14]). In particular, H/Hµis classical. Then the
p-divisible group HK:=H×SSpecKhas a ﬁltration 0 ⊆Hµ
K⊆Hf
K⊆HKwhich
veriﬁes the condition of semistable reduction with H†=H◦andH‡=H/Hµ.
Therefore the image of the functor ( ) Kis contained in BTst
K, and this is the
essential image by Lemma 5.8(d).
We show that the functor is faithful. Let f:G→Hbe a morphism in BTlog
S,d
such that fK:=f×SSpecK= 0. It suﬃces to show that f= 0. Let 0→
G◦→G→G´ et→0 be the connected-´ etale decomposition of G. Thenfinduces
morphisms f◦:G◦→H◦andf´ et:G´ et→H´ et. Since f◦×SSpecK= 0 andLOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 29
f´ et×SSpecK= 0, we must have f◦= 0 and f´ et= 0 by [ 26, Thm. 4] and [ 6,
Cor. 1.2]. It follows that ffactors as G→G´ et¯f− →H◦→H. The vanishing of fK
implies that ¯fK= 0. Applying [ 26, Thm. 4] and [ 6, Cor. 1.2] again, we get ¯f= 0.
Therefore f= 0.
At last, we show that the functor is full. Let GandHbe inBTlog
S,d, and
letgK:GK→HKbe a morphism of BTK. It is enough to extend gKinto a
morphism of BTlog
S,d. The composition γK:G◦
K→GKgK−−→HK→H´ et
Kextends to
a morphism γ:G◦→H´ etby [26, Thm. 4] and [ 6, Cor. 1.2]. Since G◦is connected
andH´ etis ´ etale, γhas to be trivial and thus γK= 0. Then one can see that
gKinducesG◦
K→H◦
KandG´ et
K→H´ et
Kwhich extend to morphisms g◦:G◦→H◦
andg´ et:G´ et→H´ etrespectively. In order to extend gK, it suﬃces to identify the
push-forward of Gas an extension of G´ etbyG◦alongg◦and the pull-back of H
as an extension of H´ etbyH◦alongg´ et, as depicted below

similar argument in the beginning of this part shows that gKinduces 1 Hµand
an isomorphism gK,µ:GK/Hµ
K→HK/Hµ
K, and the latter extends to a unique
isomorphism gµ:G/Hµ→H/Hµby [26, Thm. 4] and [ 6, Cor. 1.2]. We identify
G/HµwithH/Hµthroughgµ, and denote it by H‡. For each positive integer n, let

6. Fontaine’s conjecture for log p-divisible groups
LetOKsatisfy the stronger assumption ( ∗) from the Introduction and let Sbe
SpecOKequipped with the canonical log structure.30 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
In this section, we will prove the second part of Theorem B, which is t he
logarithmic analogue of Fontaine’s conjecture on Galois representa tions associated
withp-divisible groups.
6.1. From log p-divisible groups to Galois representations. Now for a
logp-divisible group H∈BTlog
S,d, we denote by Vp(H)∈RepQp(GK) thep-adic
Galois representation attached to the generic ﬁber HKofH.
Let 0→H◦→H→H´ et→0 be the connected-´ etale decomposition of H∈
BTlog
S,d. By Theorem 3.15, there exists a classical p-divisible group HcloverSthat
is an extension of H´ etbyH◦, and a homomorphism β:H´ et(1)→H◦, such that
H= Φ(Hcl,β). By the construction of Φ( Hcl,β), thep-adic Galois representation
Vp(H) can be constructed from the pair ( Vp(Hcl),β) as follows.
Let
(6.1) Vπ:=Vp(Mπ[p∞])∈RepQp(GK)
be thep-adic Galois representation associated to the log p-divisible group Mπ[p∞]
ofthe log1-motive Mπ= [Z1/mapst≀→π−→Gm,log]. Note that Vπisalsothe p-adicGalois rep-
resentation associatedto the Tate curve with q-invariant π. ThusVπis a semistable
representation by [ 1, IV.5.4] and we have a short exact sequence of p-adic Galois
representations
(6.2) 0 →Qp(1)→Vπ→Qp→0.
Tensoring with the unramiﬁed representation Vp(H´ et) ofGK, we get a short exact
sequence
(6.3) 0 →Vp(H´ et)(1)→Vπ⊗QpVp(H´ et)→Vp(H´ et)→0.
Thep-adic Galois representation Vp(Φ2(β)) associated to the log p-divisible
group Φ 2(β) is given by the push-out
(6.4) 0 /d47/d47Vp(H´ et)(1) /d47/d47
Vp(β)
/d15/d15Vπ⊗QpVp(H´ et) /d47/d47
/d15/d15Vp(H´ et) /d47/d470
0 /d47/d47Vp(H◦) /d47/d47Vp(Φ2(β)) /d47/d47Vp(H´ et) /d47/d470.
ThenVp(H) is given by the Baer sum of Vp(Φ2(β)) andVp(Hcl) as extensions of
Vp(H´ et) byVp(H◦).
Aiming to prove that Vp(H) is semistable, we ﬁrst check that usual operations
on extensions of p-adic Galois representations respect semistability.
Lemma 6.5.Let0→V1→V2→V3→0be an extension of p-adic Galois
representations with V1andV3semistable.
(a)V2is semistable if and only if the sequence
0→Dst(V1)→Dst(V2)→Dst(V3)→0LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 31
is exact, where Dst(V) := (V⊗QpBst)GKis the functor from [5,§4.1], see
also(2.3).
(b) Letf:V1→V′
1be a homomorphism of semistable p-adic Galois repre-
sentations. Assume that V2is semistable. Then the push-out f∗V2ofV2
alongfis also semistable.
(c) Letg:V′
3→V3be a homomorphism of semistable p-adic Galois repre-
sentations. Assume that V2is semistable. Then the push-back g∗V2ofV2
alonggis also semistable.
(d) Let0→V1→V′
2→V3→0be another extension of p-adic Galois
representations. Assume that both V2andV′
2are semistable. Then the
Baer sum of V2andV′
2as extensions is also semistable.
Proof. (a) The sequence is obviously left exact. It is exact if and only if
dimK0(Dst(V2)) = dim K0(Dst(V1))+dim K0(Dst(V3)).
SinceV1andV3are semistable, we get
dimK0(Dst(V1))+dim K0(Dst(V3)) = dim Qp(V1)+dim Qp(V3) = dim Qp(V2).
SinceV2is semistableif andonlyif dim K0(Dst(V2)) = dim Qp(V2), the result follows.
(b) Since f∗V2is a push-out, we have the following commutative diagram
0 /d47/d47Dst(V1) /d47/d47
Dst(f)
/d15/d15Dst(V2) /d47/d47
/d15/d15Dst(V3)
0 /d47/d47Dst(V′
1) /d47/d47Dst(f∗V2) /d47/d47Dst(V3)
with exact rows. Since V2is semistable, the last map of the upper row of the
diagram is actually surjective by (a). And thus so is the last map of th e lower row.
Again by (a), f∗V2is semistable.
(c) Since g∗V2is a pull-back, we have the following commutative diagram
0 /d47/d47Dst(V1) /d47/d47Dst(g∗V2) /d47/d47
/d15/d15Dst(V′
3)
Dst(g)
/d15/d15δ′/d47/d47H1(GK,V1⊗QpBst)
0 /d47/d47Dst(V1) /d47/d47Dst(V2) /d47/d47Dst(V3)δ/d47/d47H1(GK,V1⊗QpBst)
with exact rows. Since V2is semistable, we get δ= 0 by (a). Therefore δ′= 0.
Again by (a), we have that g∗V2is semistable.
(d) Since the Baer sum is constructed out of product, push-out a nd pull-back,
the result follows from (a), (b) and (c). /square
Lemma6.6.The Galois representation Vπ⊗QpVp(H´ et)is semistable.32 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
Proof. SinceH´ etis a classical p-divisible group over S, the representation
Vp(H´ et) is crystalline, in particular semistable. By [ 5, Prop. 4.2], the tensor
productVπ⊗QpVp(H´ et) of two semistable representations is also semistable. /square
Proposition 6.7.LetH∈BTlog
S,d. ThenVp(H)∈RepQp(GK)is semistable
with Hodge-Tate weights in {0,1}.
Proof. SinceHclis a classical p-divisible group, Vp(Hcl) is semistable (see
Theorem A). As Vp(H) is given by the Baer sum of Vp(Φ2(β)) andVp(Hcl) as
extensions of Vp(H´ et) byVp(H◦), we are reduced to showing that Vp(Φ2(β)) is
semistable by Lemma 6.5 (d). But the semi-stability of Vp(Φ2(β)) follows from
Lemma 6.6 and Lemma 6.5 (b).
SinceVp(H´ et)andVp(H◦)arep-adicGaloisrepresentationsassociatedtoclassi-
calp-divisible groups, they are crystalline representations with Hodge- Tate weights
in{0,1}by Theorem A. The representations Vp(H◦),Vp(H´ et) andVp(H) are all
Hodge-Tate. By [ 10, Prop. 1.6 (iii)], the functor DHT(−) := (−⊗QpBHT)GKis an
exact functor on the category of Hodge-Tate representations , therefore we have a
short exact sequence
0→DHT(Vp(H◦))→DHT(Vp(H))→DHT(Vp(H´ et))→0.
It follows that the Hodge-Tate weights of Vp(H) are in{0,1}. /square
6.2. From Galois representations to log p-divisible groups. In this sub-
section we associate to any ρ∈Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK) a logarithmic p-divisible group in
BTlog
S,d. The key ingredient is Fargues’ theory of p-divisible rigid analytic groups
in [7, 8]. In this subsection, analytic space means paracompact strictly K-analytic
space in the sense of Berkovich, or equivalently, quasi-separated rigidK-analytic
space that has an admissible aﬃnoid covering of ﬁnite type. The equiv alence is
locally described by associating Berkovich spectrum M(A) with the maximal spec-
trum Sp( A) whenAis a strictly K-aﬃnoid algebra.
Recall that a p-divisible rigid analytic K-group is a commutative rigid analytic
K-group such that the p-multiplication is topologically nilpotent, ﬁnite, and sur-
jective [8, Def. 1.1]. One should not confuse p-divisible rigid analytic groups with
p-divisible groups; indeed any object in BTKproduces a p-divisible rigid analytic
K-group, but the converse does not hold: Grig
ais a counterexample.
LetBTrig
Kbe the category of p-divisible rigid analytic K-groups. This notation
is taken from [ 8,§1], and the corresponding notation in [ 7,§2.1, Def. 3] isRK. Let
Cbe the completion of a ﬁxed algebraic closure of K. By [8,§1] or more precisely
[7, Cor. 17], there is an equivalence of categories between BTrig
Kand the category
of triples (Λ ,W,α), where Λ is a (continuous) representation of GKon a ﬁnite rank
freeZp-module, Wis a ﬁnite dimensional K-vector space, and
α:WC(1) :=W⊗KC(1)→Λ⊗ZpC=: ΛCLOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 33
is aC-linear map which is compatible with the Galois actions. Given a triple
(Λ,W,α), letGrigbe the corresponding p-divisible rigid analytic K-group. Then
as stated in [ 8,§1] Λ can be recovered from Grigas
(6.8) Λ = Tp(Grig[p∞]),
whereGrig[pn] is thepn-torsion subgroup of GrigandGrig[p∞] := lim−→nGrig[pn].
Note that Grig[p∞] can be viewed as an object in BTKby [7,§1.2, Cor. 2].
Letρ:GK→GL(Λ) be in Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK), and consider the triple
(Λ,(ΛC(−1))GK,α)
withαthe canonicalinclusion. Let Grig(ρ) be thep-divisiblerigid analytic K-group
corresponding to (Λ ,(ΛC(−1))GK,α), see the beginning of [ 8,§2];
here we add a superscriptrigto stress that it is a rigid analytic object. We
regardGrig(ρ)[p∞] as an object in BTK, andρis justTp(Grig(ρ)[p∞]) by (6.8).
We are going to show that Grig(ρ)[p∞] has semistable reduction and thus extends
to a unique G∈BTlog
S,dby Theorem 5.19.
Proposition 6.9.We have Grig(ρ)[p∞]∈BTst
K.
Proof. By [7,§1.4, Prop. 8], Grig(ρ) ﬁts into a short exact sequence
0→Grig(ρ)◦→Grig(ρ)→π0(Grig(ρ))→0
of sheaves of abelian groups on the big ´ etale site of M(K), where Grig(ρ)◦denotes
the identity component of Grig(ρ) andπ0(Grig(ρ)) is the ´ etale analytic group of
connected components. By [ 7,§2.8, Prop. 21], the above short exact sequence
gives rise to a short exact sequence
0→Grig(ρ)◦[p∞]→Grig(ρ)[p∞]→π0(Grig(ρ))→0
ofp-divisible rigid analytic groups, which can also be regarded as a short e xact
sequence of p-divisible groups over Kby [7,§2.10, Cor. 13].
By [8, Prop. 2.1], since ρis semistable with Hodge-Tate weights in {0,1}, the
action ofGKonπ0(Grig(ρ))(K) is unramiﬁed and Grig(ρ)◦is isomorphic to the
open unit ball ˚Bd
Kof dimension d. Therefore, the p-divisible group π0(Grig(ρ)) in
BTKextends to an´ etale p-divisiblegroup G´ etoverOK. By [7,§6, Thm. 6.1], there
exists ap-divisible formal group FoverOKwhose associated rigid analytic group
isGrig(ρ)◦. LetG◦:=F[p∞] be the (formal) p-divisible group over OKassociated
withF(see [7, Introduction]), and let Gµbe the multiplicative part of G◦. Then34 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
we have G◦
K=Grig(ρ)◦[p∞],G´ et
K=π0(Grig(ρ)), and a commutative diagram

Claim: Grig(ρ)[p∞]/Gµ
Kextends to a unique p-divisible group over OKup to
unique isomorphism.
The uniqueness follows from Tate’s theorem (see [ 26, Thm. 4]). We show the
existence. Let HKbe the Cartier dual of Grig(ρ)[p∞]/Gµ
K. It suﬃces to show that
HKextends a p-divisible group over OK. Letτdenote the Galois Zp-representation
associatedto HK. Thenτasasubrepresentationof ρ∨(1) issemistablewith Hodge-
Tate weights in{0,1}by [4, Cor. 3.16 (ii)], where ( −)∨denotes the dual represen-
tation and (−)(1) denotes the Tate twist of Galois representation. Since G◦/Gµis
connected and has no multiplicative part, its Cartier dual is connect ed and thus
the associated Galois representation has no non-trivial potentially unramiﬁed quo-
tient. Obviously the Galois representation associated to the Cartie r dual (G´ et)∗
ofG´ ethas no non-trivial potentially unramiﬁed quotient. It follows that τhas
no non-trivial potentially unramiﬁed quotient. Then the p-divisible rigid analytic
group associated to τis connected and comes from a p-divisible formal group Fτ
overOKby [8, Prop. 2.1] and [ 7, Thm. 6.1]. Thus we have HK= (Fτ[p∞])K, i.e.
thep-divisible group H:=Fτ[p∞] over OKextendsHK. This ﬁnishes the proof of
the claim.
Now the upper row and the right-most column of (6.10) together ex tend to the
following diagram

with exact row and column over OKandγ=β◦α. To ﬁnish the proof, we need to
show that ker( γ) (resp. coker( γ)) is a multiplicative (resp. ´ etale) p-divisible group.
But this is clear, as ker( γ) = ker(α) and coker( γ) = coker( β). /square
Corollary 6.11.Anyρ∈Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK)arises from a dual representable
logp-divisible group under the functor Tp:BTlog
S,d→RepZp(GK).
Proof. This follows from Proposition 6.9 and Theorem 5.19. /square
6.3. Proof of the second part of Theorem B. Now we are ready to prove
the second part of Theorem B. We make it into a separated theorem .
Theorem 6.12.The functor
Tp:BTlog
S,d→RepZp(GK)(resp.Vp:BTlog
S,d⊗Q→RepQp(GK))
is fully faithful and has essential image the full subcatego ryRepst,{0,1}
Zp(GK)(resp.
Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK)).
Proof. We only prove the case of Tp. By deﬁnition, the functor Tpin the
statement is the composition BTlog
S,d( )K−−−→BTKTp−→RepZp(GK). By Theorem
5.19, the functor ( ) Kis fully faithful. Since the base ﬁeld Kis of characteristic
0, the functor Tp:BTK→RepZp(GK) is fully faithful. It follows that the functor
Tpin the statement is fully faithful. The rest follows from Proposition 6.7 and
Corollary 6.11. /square
6.4. Consequences of Theorem B. Theproof of Corollary C is now imme-
diate. By Theorem B, it suﬃces to show that AKhas semistable reduction if and
only ifAK[p∞] has semistable reduction, and this follows from [ 14, Expos´ e IX] as
explained in [ 6, proof of 2.5].
Also the proof of Corollary D is now easy. By [ 3, Conj. 2.2.6 (1)] (proved in
[18, Thm. 2.3.5] for p >2) and [3, Thm. 2.2.7 (2)], there is an anti-equivalence
between the category of strongly divisible modules of weight ≤1 and the category
Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK). Then one concludes by Theorem B(b).

(3) the functor Dst:Repst
Qp(GK)≃− →Ma,V/mapsto→(V⊗QpBst)GK(see [5,§4.1],
as well as Subsection 1.1) is an exact tensor functor, as well as an e quiv-
alence of categories by [ 5, Prop. 4.2]. Here we take its restriction to
Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK), which is an equivalence with the category Ma,{−1,0}.
For any object in BTlog
S,d(resp. in BTst
K), there is an associated Kato mon-
odromy (resp. Grothendieck monodromy). By Theorem 5.15 Kato m onodromy
is compatible with Grothendieck monodromy along the equivalence of c ategories
( )K. It seems that there is no monodromy associated to a representa tionρin
Repst,{0,1}
Zp(GK). Nevertheless if we pass to Ma,{−1,0}, we have the K0-linear endo-
morphism Non theK0-vector space Dst(ρ⊗ZpQp). Given an object H∈BTlog
S,d,
it is natural to investigate the relation between the Kato monodrom yβofHand
the map NonDst(Vp(H)). This subsection is devoted to this investigation.
For convenience, for V∈Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK) we call the map NofDst(V) the
Fontaine monodromy map ofV, as well as of Dst(V) by abuse of terminology.
Let 0→H◦→H→H´ et→0 be the connected-´ etale decomposition (see
(3.17)) of H, and let ( Hcl,β) be the pair guaranteed by Theorem 3.15, and thus
β:H´ et(1)→H◦is the Kato monodromy of Haccording to Deﬁnition 3.16. Let
Vπ∈Repst,{0,1}
Qp(GK) be the representation (6.1) associated to the log 1-motive
Mπ= [Z1/mapst≀→π−→Gm,log]. It ﬁts into a short exact sequence 0 →Qp(1)a− →Vπb− →Qp→
0 inRepst,{0,1}
Qp(GK), see (6.2). Since the Fontaine monodromy map decreases the
slope by 1 (see [ 5,§3.3]), the Fontaine monodromy map of Vπfactors as
Dst(Vπ)Dst(b)−−−−→Dst(Qp)Nπ−−→Dst(Qp(1))Dst(a)−−−−→Dst(Vπ).
SinceDst:Repst
Qp(GK)≃− →Mais a tensor functor, the Fontaine monodromy map
ofVp(Mπ[p∞]⊗ZpH´ et) factors as
Dst(Vp(Mπ[p∞]⊗ZpH´ et))→Dst(Vp(H´ et))1Dst(Vp(H´ et))⊗Nπ
−−−−−−−−−−−−→ Dst(Vp(H´ et)(1))
→Dst(Vp(Mπ[p∞]⊗ZpH´ et)).
LetNβbe the composition
(6.13)Nβ:Dst(Vp(H))→Dst(Vp(H´ et))1Dst(Vp(H´ et))⊗Nπ
−−−−−−−−−−−−→ Dst(Vp(H´ et)(1))
Dst(Vp(β))−−−−−−−→ Dst(Vp(H◦))→Dst(Vp(H)).LOGp-DIVISIBLE GROUPS AND SEMISTABLE REPRESENTATIONS 37
Note that the operator Nβhas mixed information from Fontaine’s monodromy and
Kato’s monodromy.
The main result of this subsection is the following theorem.
Theorem 6.14.The Fontaine monodromy map of Dst(V(H))agrees with Nβ
deﬁned in (6.13).
We need a lemma for proving it.
Lemma6.15.LetD1,D2∈Ma,{−1,0}.
(a) The slopes of D1andD2lie in[−1,0].
(b) Assume that D1is of slope 0and the slopes of D2lie in[−1,0). Then
(b.1) Both D1andD2have trivial Fontaine monodromy map.
(b.2) Let 0→D2i− →Dq− →D1→0be an extension in the abelian category
Ma,{−1,0}. Then the Fontaine monodromy map NDofDfactors as
Dq− →D1ND−−→D2i− →D.
(b.3) Let f:D2→D3be a map in Ma,{−1,0}. Assume that the slopes of
D3lie in[−1,0). Letf∗Dbe the pushout of Dalongf, as depicted
in the diagram

LetNf∗Dbe the map deﬁned in (b.2) for f∗D. Then
Nf∗D=f◦ND.
(b.4) Let g:D4→D1be a map in Ma,{−1,0}. Assume that D4is of slope
0. Letg∗Dbe the pullback of Dalongg, as depicted in the diagram
0 /d47/d47D2i /d47/d47Dq/d47/d47D1/d47/d470

LetNg∗Dbe the map deﬁned in (b.2) for g∗D. Then
Ng∗D=ND◦g.
(b.5) Let 0→D2i′
− →D′q′
−→D1→0be another extension of D1byD2,
and letD+BD′be the Baer sum of extensions in Ma,{−1,0}. Then
we have
ND+BD′=ND+ND′.38 ALESSANDRA BERTAPELLE, SHANWEN WANG, AND HEER ZHAO
Proof. (a) This follows from the admissibility.
We prove the assertions in (b). Both (b.1) and (b.2) follow from the f act that
the Fontaine monodromy map decreases the slope by 1.
(b.3) Since f∗Dis a quotient of D3⊕D, the Fontaine monodromy map Nf∗D
off∗Dis induced by that of D3⊕D. We have the following commutative diagram

from which we get j◦(f◦ND)◦c=Nf∗D. Sincecis surjective and jis injective,
we must have Nf∗D=f◦ND.
(b.4) Since g∗Dis a subobject of D⊕D4, the Fontaine monodromy map Ng∗D
ofg∗Dis induced by that of D⊕D4which is ND⊕0. We have the following
commutative diagram

from which we get Ng∗D=d◦(ND◦g)◦e. Sinceeis surjective and dis injective,
we must have Ng∗D=ND◦g.
(b.5) By deﬁnition D+BD′is constructed as in the following diagram

Proof of Theorem 6.14. For anyG∈BTlog
S,d, letNGbe the Fontaine mon-
odromy map of DG:=Dst(Vp(G)) =Dst(Tp(G)⊗ZpQp).
NowletH∈BTlog
S,dbe asinthe beginning ofthis subsection. Let Hβ:= Φ2(β),
and thus His the Baersum of HclandHβas extensions of H´ etbyH◦. We consider
DH(resp.DHcl, resp.DHβ) as an extension of DH´ etbyDH◦canonically, and let
NH(resp.NHcl, resp.NHβ) be the map DH´ et→DH◦deﬁned as in Lemma 6.15
(b.2). By construction, DHis the Baersum of DHclandDHβas extensions of DH´ et
byDH◦. By Lemma 6.15 (b.5), we have NH=NHcl+NHβ=NHβwhich can be
further computed as Dst(Vp(β))◦NH´ et⊗ZpMπ[p∞]by Lemma 6.15 (b.3). Previously
we have seen that NH´ et⊗ZpMπ[p∞]= 1Dst(Vp(H´ et))⊗Nπ. Therefore, NHagrees with
Nβ. /square
Theorem 6.14 tells us that the Fontaine monodromy map NHofDst(Vp(H))
is determined by the Kato monodromy map of H, i.e. one direction of Theorem F
holds. Now we discuss the other direction. Using [ 1,§II.4], one can easily compute
Nπwhich is an isomorphism of K0-vector spaces. It follows that
Vp(β) =Vst/parenleftbig
NH◦(1Dst(V(H´ et))⊗Nπ)−1/parenrightbig
,
whereVst:Ma≃− →Repst
Qp(GK) is the functor deﬁned in the third paragraph of [ 5,
§4.1] which is quasi-inverse to Dstby [5,§4.1 Cor.]. One should not confuse Vst
withVpwhich associates to an object of BTOK(orBTlog
S,d) itsQp-representation
ofGK. SinceVp:BTOK⊗Q→Repcris,{0,1}
Qp(GK) is an equivalence of categories by
Theorem A, the Kato monodromy βofHis rationally determined by NH.
