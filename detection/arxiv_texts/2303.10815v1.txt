Abstract
We develop a microscopic theory for the multimode po-
lariton dispersion in materials coupled to cavity radiation
modes. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamil-
tonian, we devise a general strategy for obtaining simple
matrix models of polariton dispersion curves based on the
structure and spatial location of multi-layered 2D materials
inside the optical cavity. Our theory exposes the connections
between seemingly distinct models that have been employed
in the literature and resolves an ambiguity that has arisen
concerning the experimental description of the polaritonic
band structure. We demonstrate the applicability of our
theoretical formalism by fabricating various geometries of
multi-layered perovskite materials coupled to cavities and
demonstrating that our theoretical predictions agree with
the experimental results presented here.
Introduction. Strongly coupling matter to quantized radi-
ation via an optical cavity enables the generation of exciting
new chemical1–11and physical phenomena12–20in a highly
controllable manner. Polaritons, light-matter hybrid quasi-
particles, are formed under light-matter coupling strengths
that are larger than competitive dissipative processes such
as cavity loss.21–24The properties of polaritons are read-
ily characterized in absorption or photoluminescence spec-
tra, by Rabi-splitting features, and by new dispersion with
an eﬀective mass much smaller than matter.15,16,25Despite
decades of research on polaritons, many aspects of polariton
physics remain elusive.26,27
The polariton dispersion in a Fabry–P´ erot cavity for a
single mode coupled to a one-dimensional excitonic chain
model with orientation parallel to the cavity mirrors, is ob-
tained by diagonalizing a simple 2 ×2 matrix.26–30The di-
agonal elements of this 2 ×2 matrix (one for the photon
and another for the exciton) correspond to the uncoupled
excitonic and photonic energies at a particular longitudinal
wavevector, and the oﬀ-diagonal terms capture the light-
matter coupling. When considering Ncavity modes coupled
to an exciton chain, one may extend the 2 ×2 matrix to an
(N+ 1)×(N+ 1) matrix where the single exciton couples
to allNcavity modes. The experimentally obtained polari-
ton dispersion, on the other hand, often deviates from the
predictions of the ( N+1)×(N+1) model and instead is bet-
ter described by a 2 N×2Nmodel.13,26,27,31This 2N×2N
model matrix is constructed by making Ncopies of the exci-
ton branch where each exciton branch couples to one cavity
mode branch, such that the overall matrix is block diago-
nal withN2×2 subblocks. Previously, classical Maxwell
theory has been used to investigate the polariton dispersion,
where the 2 N×2Nmodel appears to predict the observed
polariton dispersion correctly.27,31However, these studies do
not provide a full microscopic understanding of these eﬀects,
the origin of the 2 N×2Nmodel from the microscopic light-
matter Hamiltonian, or discuss its validity in relation to the
spatial geometry of the material.
In this work, we develop a quantum mechanical micro-
scopic theory to understand and predict the multi-mode po-
lariton dispersion of multi-layered materials coupled to radi-
ation in a Fabry–P´ erot cavity. In the following, we develop
a general (N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model (with Ne≤Nexciton
branches) that, for speciﬁc geometries and spatial locations
of multi-layered materials, reduces to ( N+ 2)×(N+ 2),
2N×2N, or (N+ 1)×(N+ 1) models. We then show that
1arXiv:2303.10815v1  [cond-mat.mtrl-sci]  20 Mar 2023the (N+1)×(N+1) model, which is derived for a single-layer
material, cannot be directly used for multi-layered materials
often studied in experiments. We demonstrate that regard-
less of inter-layer coupling, for ﬁlled cavities, the 2 N×2N
model is appropriate. Finally, we show the applicability of
this theoretical formalism by preparing multi-layered per-
ovskite materials coupled to cavities with various spatial ge-
ometries inside the cavity. We show that the multimode po-
lariton dispersion predicted by our theoretical model agrees
reasonably well with the experimental results provided here.
Exciton-Polariton Hamiltonian. Here we consider a
generalized Tavis-Cummings10,16,32(GTC) Hamiltonian de-
scribing a (Frenkel) exciton-polariton system beyond the
usual long-wavelength approximation,10,16,32–34which we
rigorously derive from the p.A Hamiltonian using orbital
and nuclear-centered gauge transformations, with details
provided in the Supporting Information (SI). The exciton-
polariton Hamiltonian of a multi-layered material in a cavity
with cavity quantization along yis given as

The GTC Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in each kxsub-
space containing only {ˆakx,ky,ˆdkx,m}and their Hermitian
conjugates with ˆhGTC(kx) as the Hamiltonian in the kx
block. Despite its convenience, an undesirable feature of the
GTC Hamiltonian is that it does not converge with respect
to the number of cavity modes. In the SI, we show that
this is due to the absence of the dipole-self energy term in
the GTC Hamiltonian and that, perhaps counterintuitively,
the GTC Hamiltonian produces accurate results only when
considering a small number of energetically relevant cavity
modes.
General strategy for multi-layered materials. For
materials with an arbitrary thickness placed inside a cav-
ity, we develop a general strategy for obtaining the polari-ton dispersion based on deﬁning new matter operators that
take advantage of the structure of the light-matter coupling.
Consider a total multi-layer width of ly=δly·Ny(with inter-
layer distance δly), wherely≤Ly. Considering Nenerget-
ically relevant cavity mode branches such that we restrict

where Λ NOis generally a non-orthogonal matrix. Note that
here{n1,n2,...}are chosen such that the above Ny×Nema-
trix contains linearly independent columns. In most cases,
Ne=N=nmax−nmin, so that relevant cavity mode func-
tions are linearly independent. We numerically construct
the Λ NOmatrix by ﬁrst initializing it with a single column
and then adding a column only if the rank (deﬁned as the
number of non-zero singular values) of the matrix containing
this additional column increases by one.
Next, we perform a QRdecomposition of Λ NOto obtain
the orthonormal matrix Λ O(corresponding to Q). Using Λ O,
we deﬁne a unitary matrix UOof dimension Ny×Nysuch

Note that when Ne= 1, the above matrix reduces to
the (N+ 1)×(N+ 1) form31,35(such as for a single-layer
material). Meanwhile, when Ne=Nand for Ω(πm

Ly), the above matrix reduces to the 2 N×2N
(such as for a ﬁlled cavity) form.26,27,31
In Fig.1 we brieﬂy summarize the schematic forms of the
Hamiltonian for various cavity setups that can be diagonal-
ized to obtain the polariton dispersion. Using the general
strategy outlined above, for a single layer material shown
in Fig. 1e, we ﬁnd the widely used ( N+ 1)×(N+ 1)
matrix.26–28,31,36–39In this model, within each kxblock,
one exciton state, corresponding to ˆd†

This 2N×2Nmatrix model contains Nnon-interacting 2×2
blocks as shown in Fig. 1f. Therefore, in a ﬁlled cavity there
existsNexciton that couple to Ncavity modes of matching
ky. We also obtain the same 2 N×2Nmodel when con-
sidering interacting layers τy/negationslash= 0 (see detailed analyticalexpressions in the SI).
For partially ﬁlled cavities we ﬁnd two interesting matrix
models depending on the position of the material inside a
cavity. For a thin material placed at the middle of the cav-
ity we ﬁnd a ( N+ 2)×(N+ 2) matrix (Fig. 1g) model
which is composed of two isolated (N

Numerical Results. Fig. 2 presents numerical results
for various multi-layered materials. In Fig. 2a-d we con-
sider a thin material which is either placed next to a mirror
(Fig. 2a-b) or in the middle of the cavity (Fig. 2c-d). We
chooseLy= 20000 a.u. and a thickness ly=δly·Ny=
2000/lessmuchLywithδly= 20 a.u. and Ny= 100. The
light-matter coupling used in Fig. 2a-d is gc= 5 meV,

we choose ω0= 2.2 eV with τx= 150 cm−1. The posi-

Here, we include ﬁve energetically relevant cavity modes

Fig. 2a shows that the ( N+ 1)×(N+ 1) model shown

In Fig. 2c-d we consider a material placed in the middle of

the (N+ 2)×(N+ 2) model shown in Fig. 1f (with details
provided in Eqns. S30-S31) correctly predicts the polariton
bands in comparison to the numerical results obtained by
directly diagonalizing ˆhGTC(kx). Note that in Fig. 2a-b the
anti-crossings grow gradually larger with respect to the ky
of the cavity mode (which scales as k3/2
yas shown in the
SI). By contrast, Fig. 2c-d shows that the anti-crossings are
large for odd kywhile they are negligible for even ky, as the
spatial dependence for even cavity modes becomes zero at
the center of the cavity. Thus, the location of the material
inside the cavity plays a crucial role in setting the polariton
dispersion.

Fig. 2e-f presents the dispersion and absorption spectra for
a ﬁlled cavity. Here, we use gc= 2 meV and use Ny= 999
withY0=δly
2= 10 and the rest of the parameters are
maintained as in Fig. 2a-d. Fig. 2e presents the correspond-
ing multimode polariton dispersion computed numerically
by diagonalizing Eq. 1 compared with the 2 N×2Nmodel
in Eqn. S19. The 2 N×2Nmodel reproduces the band dis-
persion, as expected. Overall, the results in Fig. 2 demon-
strates the validity of the approximate semi-analytical mod-
els which are suitable for speciﬁc position and properties of
the multi-layered material inside the cavity.
In Fig. 3 we explore how the spatial location and the thick-
ness of the material modiﬁes the polariton dispersion. In
Fig. 3a-c we explore the dependence of the polariton disper-
sion on material thickness by plotting polariton bands as a
function of Ny(number of layers) at various kxvalues while
keepinggc= 4.743 meV a constant. Our numerical results
show that the polariton dispersion at the two limiting ex-
tremes,Ny= 1 (single layer) and Ny= 999 (ﬁlled), can
be obtained using the ( N+ 1)×(N+ 1) and the 2 N×2N
models, respectively. For any intermediate values of Ny,
i.e. partially ﬁlled cavities, accurate polariton dispersion
can be obtained using the general ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne)
model (compare the violet dots with the black solid lines)
given in Eqn. 6. Similarly, Fig. 3d-f presents the polariton
bands at three speciﬁc value of kxand as a function of the
material location Y0. Here we use gc= 4.743 meV while

2= 9000 a.u., the polari-
ton dispersion can be obtained by the ( N+2)×(N+2) and
by (N+ 1)×(N+ 1) models, respectively.
Overall, we numerically demonstrate that the general
(N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model can be used to compute the multi-
mode polariton dispersion for arbitrary geometries of multi-
layered materials. We demonstrated that in speciﬁc scenar-
ios, simpliﬁed models such as 2 N×2N, (N+ 1)×(N+ 1)
and (N+ 2)×(N+ 2) model can be used to compute the
polariton dispersion. Our work sheds light on the recently
discussed ambiguity26,27,31,41–43of using (N+ 1)×(N+ 1)
and 2N×2Nmodels for ﬁtting experimental dispersion.
While for single-layer thin materials the ( N+ 1)×(N+ 1)
model is appropriate, the 2 N×2Nmodel is appropriate for
obtaining polariton dispersions in ﬁlled cavities. However,
our result suggest that the general (N+Ne)×(N+Ne)model
should be used in all circumstances for extracting parameters
related to light-matter coupling.
Comparison with Experiment. Here we implement
the general ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model to compute the
multimode polariton dispersion for a multi-layered per-
ovskite material and compare to the experimentally ob-
tained reﬂectance spectrum. We prepare a multi-layered
2D perovskite material BA 2(MA) 2Pb3I10, where BA =
CH3(CH 2)3NH3and MA = CH 3NH3that is sandwiched be-
tween an Ag and Au layer that act as mirrors. We also use
a Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layer as a spacer toextend the quantization length of the cavity when making
partially ﬁlled cavities. Experimental details can be found
in the SI. Note that the layers of the perovskite material can
be considered non-interacting, thus allowing us to directly
implement the general ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model to obtain
the multimode polariton dispersion.
Fig. 4 presents the multimode polariton dispersion ob-
tained experimentally via the reﬂectance spectra. Fig. 4a
shows the reﬂectance spectra obtained for ﬁlled cavity. To
obtain the theoretical multimode polariton dispersion we
model the matter as a dispersionless material with a matter
excitation energy of ω0= 2.05 eV (such that /epsilon1(kx) =ω0)
and a refractive index of ηPX= 2.2.44We directly use this
refractive index to obtain the uncoupled photon band disper-
sionωc(k) =c
η|k|for the ﬁlled cavity presented in Fig. 4a.
We use an individual layer thickness of δly= 50 a.u.45Note
that forδly/lessmuchly(that is for large Ny), the explicit value of
theδlydoes not matter. We ﬁnd gc≈4.2 meV (such that

Ly}, for constructing the general
(N+Ne)×(N+Ne) matrix. In addition to this we can also
construct approximate ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne) models by ig-
noring weakly coupled excitonic branches. A numerical way
to perform this approximation is by using a tolerance fac-
tor/epsilon1tol(set to 0.1 here) below which the singular values are
considered to be 0 when checking for linear independence
via the use of Eqn. 2 for constructing Λ NO. The disper-
5sion obtained with the general ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model
(dashed lines) and the approximate ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne)
model (black circles) is overlayed on the experimentally ob-
tained reﬂectance in Fig. 4a-c. These results show that our
theoretical model is able to ﬁt the experimental dispersion
very well. Note that the upper polariton branches are not
visible in the experimental dispersion for this structure be-
cause the thick semiconductor absorbs too much above-gap
light.46,47
In Fig. 4a only two parameters gcandLyare used for
ﬁtting the experimental dispersion. As can be seen, these
parameters provide accurate band dispersion compared to
the experimental results. The numerically computed ap-
proximate ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne) matrix model at kx= 0 is
shown in Fig, 4d, which exactly takes the form of the widely
used 2N×2Nmodel.26–28,31
Next in Fig. 4b we manufacture a partially ﬁlled cavity by
using PMMA as a spacer. The refractive index of the PMMA
isηPMMA = 1.5. For a cavity ﬁlled with materials of diﬀer-
ent refractive index, we obtain an eﬀective refractive index
through ﬁtting such that 1 .5<η< 2.2. Here we obtain, the
length of the perovskite material ly= 5550 a.u., the length
of the cavity Ly≈24142 a.u., gc≈5.39 meV and the eﬀec-
tive refractive index η= 1.65 by ﬁtting the dispersion curves
visually. Here we have considered ﬁve energetically relevant
cavity mode branches (the 3rd to 7th cavity mode branch
alongy) withky∈{3π
Ly,4π
Ly,5π
Ly,6π
Ly,7π
Ly}. These parameters
ﬁt the dispersion with reasonable accuracy. The numerically
computed approximate ( N+Ne)×(N+Ne) matrix at kx= 0
is shown in Fig, 4e for the case shown in Fig, 4b. As can
be seen here, the matrix has a ( N+ 2)×(N+ 2) structure
with a very complex set of couplings between the cavity and
exciton branches.
Finally, in Fig. 4c we show results after fabrication of par-
tially ﬁlled cavities with the material placed near the center
of the cavity. Here, we ﬁt and obtain Ly= 28278 a.u.,
ly= 4500 a.u., η= 1.67,gc≈5.146 meV and addition-
ally ﬁnd the location of the material Y0= 5.1×Ly, by
visually ﬁtting the dispersion. Here we have considered ﬁve
energetically relevant cavity mode branches (3rd to 7th cav-
ity mode branch along y). The corresponding approximate
(N+Ne)×(N+Ne) matrix at kx= 0 is shown in Fig. 4e
for the case shown in Fig. 4f which, similar to the previous
case, has a ( N+2)×(N+2) structure with a complex set of
couplings. In all cases we capture all of the subtle features
of the experimental dispersion with reasonable accuracy.
Conclusions. In this work we have presented a micro-
scopic theory for obtaining multimode polariton dispersion
of a material inside a cavity. Starting with the GTC Hamil-
tonian, we develop a general strategy to obtain the polariton
dispersion in multimode cavities, which takes the form of a
general (N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model. Unlike the widely used
2N×2Nor (N+ 1)×(N+ 1) models, our approach can
be used for a material of arbitrary thickness and position
within the cavity to obtain the multimode polariton disper-
sion. In contrast to previous approaches of directly ﬁtting
matrix elements, our method relies on structural parame-
ters like the thickness and location of the material inside
the cavity. We show that in certain limiting scenarios, the
general (N+Ne)×(N+Ne) model reduces to the widely used
2N×2N(for a ﬁlled cavity) model or the ( N+ 1)×(N+ 1)
(single or thin layer placed beside a mirror) model, and ﬁnd
other interesting models such as the ( N+2)×(N+2) model
that describes a thin material placed in the middle of thecavity.
While in this work we have employed a simple tight-
binding model for the matter, our strategy can be general-
ized to using ab initio electronic structure theory with mul-
tiple bands. In future research, we will extend this approach
toward ab initio modeling.

k,ξ(ˆak,ξ) is the photon creation (annihilation)
operator for radiation mode kwith polarization ξ∈{s,p}. Note that we assume the charges of the nuclei are unity for simplicity, but
the generalization beyond this is straightforward. The vector potential is then given as [1]

First, we perform a nuclear-centered Power-Zienau-Woolley (PZW) transformation following Ref. [2, 3] for the nuclear DOF with the
unitary transformation operator ˆUnuc=e−iˆA(Ru)·/summationtext

approximation of dropping of all spin degrees of freedom which also means that we drop all degeneracies coming from the orbital part
of the electronic levels [6]. Overall, here we consider a charge neutral system such that we have equal number of electron and charged
nuclei. Using this transformation one obtains [5] ˆH/prime

2 Exciton-Polariton Hamiltonian
We construct a simple (Frenkel) exciton-polariton Hamiltonian using the d.E Hamiltonian provided in the previous section. We adopt a
simple two-band model with dispersionless valence and conduction bands, separated in energy by ω0. We use a matter basis containing
a ground state|G/angbracketright=/producttext

where one electron is placed in a localized excited state from a localized ground state at Ru[7, 6]. These localized excitons interact via
nearest-neighbor interactions as is done in the standard Frankel exciton model. We also assume that within this basis, the permanent
dipolesµα,α= 0 and only retain the transition dipoles µα,α/primewithα/negationslash=α/prime. Further, using a transformation Uφ=/producttext

Note that the above Hamiltonian can be generalized to ab initio systems where there are multiple energetically relevant electronic
transitions with transition dipole moments aligned along arbitrary directions such that both sandppolarization need to be taken into
account.
We can further apply additional approximations to simplify the above Hamiltonian. First, we perform the rotating wave approximation

We investigate the validity of the approximations used to obtain the generalized Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian below in Sec. 3. Impor-
tantly, we show that the ˆHGTC remains valid only when considering a few energetically relevant cavity modes.
32.1 d.E Hamiltonian at kz= 0
We place the localized excitations in a grid with positions Rn,m,l =Xnˆx+Ymˆy+Zlˆz. To simplify our considerations, we will only
consider nearest-neighbor coupling, such that ˆd†
n,m,lcouples to ˆdn±1,m,l,ˆdn,m±1,land ˆdn,m,l±1throughτx,τyandτz, respectively.
Since here we focus on multi-layer materials where the inter-layer coupling is weak or negligible, we set τy= 0.
Next, we consider periodic boundary conditions along ˆ xand ˆzdirections, such that RN+1,m,l≡R1,m,landRn,m,N +1≡Rn,m,1.
Due to the periodic boundaries in the ˆ xand ˆzdirections, the cavity modes k= (kx,ky,kz) are quantized such that kx=2π

nx= 0,±1,±2,...,±nxmaxandkz=2π

n= 1,2,...,Nxwith a similar expression for Zl.
In most experiments, including ours, the polariton dispersion is plotted along kxwhilekzis set to 0. To obtain this dispersion, we deﬁne

and their Hermitian conjugates. A simpliﬁed form of the Hamiltonian, the generalized Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, is obtained by

which is block-diagonal in each kxsubspace containing only {ˆakx,ky,ˆdkx,m}and their Hermitian conjugates with ˆhGTC(kx) as the
Hamiltonian in the kxblock. In this work, we use ˆHGTC(kz= 0) due to its simple block-diagonalized structure, as opposed to
ˆHd.E(kz= 0), and develop simple matrix models to obtain the polariton dispersion for multi-layered material inside the cavity.
3 Mode truncation and dipole self-energy
Here we discuss how to deal with energetically oﬀ-resonant cavity modes in the GTC Hamiltonian ˆHGTC and comment on the role of
missing DSE terms. To assess the accuracy of ˆHGTC(kz= 0), we consider a single layer material placed inside an optical cavity as
depicted in Fig. S1a. The exact polariton dispersion is computed by solving ˆHd.E(kz= 0) given in Eqn. S15, and is shown as dark blue
solid lines with ﬁlled circles in Fig. S1b-d. These exact results are computed by converging with respect to the number of cavity mode
alongkyand the number of Fock states for each of these modes. In Fig. S1 we use τx= 150 cm−1andω0−2τz= 0.62 eV.
When using the ˆHd.E(kz= 0), our result shows that the energetically oﬀ-resonant cavity modes do not contribute to the low-energy
polaritonic subspace, as one expects. However, counterintuitively, the contributions to the DSE term these oﬀ-resonant modes and the
associated light-matter coupling term are non-negligible. DSE makes a positive contribution, while the coupling term makes a negative
contribution. Thus, when performing mode truncation by removing cavity modes with ky>kymaxthat are energetically oﬀ-resonant
inˆHd.E(kz= 0), both the corresponding coupling terms as well as the associated DSE terms must be dropped. This means we must
restrict the sum/summationtext
ky→/summationtext
ky≤kymaxfor both the coupling terms as well as the DSE terms despite the DSE being purely a matter
operator (which ensures gauge invariance [10, 11]).
Therefore, when considering ˆHGTC(kz= 0) which ignores the dipole self-energy but retains the light-matter coupling term partially
(since we employ the RWA), this balance is broken. As a result, a very undesirable feature of ˆHGTC(kz= 0) (and thus the ˆHGTC) is
that the polariton eigenspectrum (or polariton dispersion) computed with it does not converge with respect to the number of cavity
modeky. This is shown in Fig. S1(b)-(d).
In Fig. S1(b), we present the polariton band structure computed exactly using direct diagonalization of ˆHd.E(kz= 0) compared with
the approximate ˆHGTC(kz= 0) using diﬀerent numbers of kycavity modes. Here we choose a light-matter coupling gc= 25 meV where
gk=/radicalbigg
ωc(kx,ky)
ωc(0,π/Ly)gc(note thatkz= 0 andωc(kx,ky)≡ωc(kx,ky,0) =c/radicalBig
k2x+k2y). When considering only one mode ˆHGTC(kz= 0)
provides visually indistinguishable results compared to the exact benchmark. However, as number of kycavity modes are increased in
ˆHGTC(kz= 0) the cavity dispersion starts to diverge. The same is observed in Fig. S1(c), where we compute the polariton bands at
kx= 0 as a function of the coupling gc. This result corroborates previous work in the single-molecule cavity setup [10] and in circuit
QED [12] under the long-length approximation. Note that here, importantly, in contrast to these other works, we only make the long
wavelength approximation on the atomic scale, not on the scale of the entire materials.
To illustrate the cancellation of the DSE and coupling terms for the oﬀ-resonant cavity modes, in Fig. S1(d), we considered eight cavity
mode branches ky∈{π
Ly,2π
Ly,...,8π
Ly}whereky=π
Lymode is resonant with matter excitations at kx= 0 (the rest of the modes can
be regarded as oﬀ-resonant) with gc= 30 meV. We compare the full dipole gauge Hamiltonian (i.e. ‘exact’) with an approximation
where we remove all the dipole self-energy (DSE) terms associated with oﬀ-resonant cavity modes ky>π
Lywhile retaining the coupling
terms between matter and oﬀ-resonant cavity modes (cyan dashed lines). Finally, we compute the dispersion when including the DSE
4terms associated with the oﬀ-resonant cavity modes ( ky>π
Ly), while removing the coupling terms between matter and oﬀ-resonant
cavity modes (red solid lines). As explained before, it can be seen that the DSE terms (coming from the oﬀ-resonant modes) contribute
a positive amount while the coupling terms contribute a negative amount, and the magnitude of these two contributions is the same
(up to the second order in light-matter coupling as shown in Ref. [10]) but with opposite signs. When including both, their overall
contribution (originating from the oﬀ-resonant modes) vanishes, and thus a single-mode GTC generates accurate results compared to
exact. Therefore, when using the GTC model, we must restrict our consideration to a few energetically relevant cavity modes and, the
(conveniently) drop all energetically oﬀ-resonant modes from the Hamiltonian.
4 Various cavity setups and corresponding matrix models
4.1 Single Layer
First, we consider the simplest scenario, a single layer, such that the sum over mand the index itself can be removed (such that
ˆdkx,m→ˆdkx). The ˆhGTC(kx) Hamiltonian for a single layer is then written as,
ˆhGTC(kx) =/summationdisplay

kxˆdkx+/summationdisplay
kygk/parenleftbig
ˆa†
kˆdkx+ ˆakˆd†
kx/parenrightbig
sin(kyY0), (S17)
where/epsilon1(kx) =ω0−2τxcos(kxδlx),Y0is the location of the single layer along the ˆydirection inside the cavity. For this single layer
placed between the two mirrors 0 < Y0< Ly, the ˆhGTC(kx) Hamiltonian can be written conveniently in the single excited subspace
using the basis spanning {ˆa†
kx,ky|G,0/angbracketright,ˆd†
kx|G,0/angbracketright}where|G,0/angbracketrightrepresents the matter ground state with no photons in the cavity. For a
givenkx, this is the basis of Ncavity modes to account for kyand one matter state for the exciton. Therefore, ˆhGTC(kx) matrix takes
the form of the widely used ( N+ 1)×(N+ 1) matrix [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

where Ω(ky) =gksin(ky·Y0) and/epsilon1(kx) =ω0−2τxcos(kxδlx). Diagonalizing the above matrix provides the polariton dispersion along
kxfor a single layer coupled to cavity radiation modes.
4.2 Filled cavity with non-interacting layers
Here, we consider a material ﬁlling the cavity ( ly=Ly). We assume that mth layer is centered at Ym= (m−1

m= 1,2,...Nyandky=nyπ

Diagonalizing the above matrix provides the polariton dispersion along kxfor a multi-layer (non-interacting) material ﬁlling up the
entire cavity. The same results are obtained when considering interacting layers τy/negationslash= 0 (shown in the supporting information). This is
because the same transformation also diagonalizes the inter-layer coupling term.
4.3 Filled cavity with interacting layers
Here we consider a ﬁlled cavity with interacting layers. For τy/negationslash= 0, we focus on the light-matter coupling term (within a kxsubspace),

5 Experimental Details
5.1 CH 3(CH 2)3NH 3)2(CH 3NH 3)2Pb3I10crystal synthesis
.
The synthesis followed an aqueous solution crystallization procedure. Lead (II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999% trace metals bases) powder (2720
mg, 5.9 mmol) was dissolved in hydriodic acid solution (HI, 9 mL, 57% wt.) with 1 mL hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2, 50% wt.) as
the reducing agent. The solution was heated to 105oC under constant magnetic stirring. Addition of methylammonium iodide (MAI,
≥99%, anhydrous 636 mg, 4.0 mmol) and n-butylammonium iodide (BAI, 382 mg, 1.9 mmol) produced black precipitation instantly
and redissolved in 5 mins. The solution was subjected to a controlled cooling rate of 0.5oC/h to room temperature in an oil bath. The
crystals were collected by vacuum ﬁltering and washed twice with toluene. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
5.2 Perovskites cavities fabrication.
The three cavity samples in the main text all consist of exfoliated single crystals of CH 3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3I10placed between
a pair of metallic mirrors. The bottom mirror, a 30 nm gold ﬁlm, was deposited on cover glass (Richard-Allan Scientiﬁc, 24 ×50 #1.5)
by electron-beam evaporation (Angstrom EvoVac deposition system) with a deposition rate of 0.05 nm/s. This thin glass/Au mirror
allows partial light transmission for spectroscopic interrogation. The top mirror was a 200 nm silver deposited by the same method.
For the partially ﬁlled cavity of Figure 4b, thin perovskite ﬂakes were mechanically exfoliated with PVC tape (Nitto SPV224 PVC
Vinyl Surface Protection Specialty Tape) and transferred onto the bottom Au mirror. A 1040 nm thick layer of PMMA [Poly(methyl
methacrylate), 950 MW, Kayaku Advanced Materials] was then deposited on the perovskite through spin-coating at 1000 rpm. The
structure is then baked at 170 °C for 5 mins to homogenize the interface, before depositing the top silver mirror.
For the partially ﬁlled cavity of Figure 4c, a 515 nm PMMA spacer was spin-coated at 3000 rpm on the bottom Au mirror. The
structure is baked at 170 °C for 5 mins before exfoliating perovskite single crystals on top of the PMMA. A second PMMA spacer was
subsequently spin-coated (3000 rpm, baked at 130 °C for 2 mins) on the perovskite ﬂakes, followed by deposition of the top silver mirror.
For the ﬁlled cavity sample of Figure 4a, the perovskite ﬂakes were exfoliated onto the bottom Au mirror with PVC tape. The top
silver mirror was evaporated on a Si substrate, then template-stripped and deposited on the Au/perovskite structure using thermal
release tape.
