Abstract
This paper mainly concerns the KAM persistence of the mappin gF:Tn×E→Tn×Rnwith
intersection property, where E⊂Rnis a connected closed bounded domain with interior points.
By assuming that the frequency mapping satisﬁes certain top ological degree condition and weak
convexity condition, we prove some Moser type results about the invariant torus of mapping F
with frequency-preserving under small perturbations. To o ur knowledge, this is the ﬁrst approach
to Moser’s theorem with frequency-preserving. Moreover, g iven perturbed mappings over Tn, it is
shown that such persistence still holds when the frequency m apping and perturbations are only con-
tinuous about parameter beyond Lipschitz or even H¨ older ty pe. We also touch the parameter without
dimension limitation problem under such settings.
Keywords: Mapping with intersection property, invariant torus, freq uency-preserving.

1 Introduction
The celebrated KAM theory is established by Kolmogorov [ 15], Arnold [ 1] and Moser [ 22]. It mainly
concerns the stability of motions or orbits in dynamical systems und er small perturbations and indeed
has a long history of over sixty years. So far, as well known, KAM th eory has been widely spread to
various systems, such as volume-preserving ﬂows due to Broer et al [3], generalized Hamiltonian systems
due to Parasyuk [ 24] and Li and Yi [ 18,19], ﬁnitely diﬀerentiable Hamiltonians due to Salamon [ 30],
Bounemoura [ 2] and Koudjinan [ 16], Gevrey Hamiltonians due to Popov [ 25], and multiscale dynamical
systems due to Qian et al [ 26]. For other related results, see for instance, [ 5–7,27,29,32,38]. In studying
discrete dynamical systems, Moser [ 22] ﬁrstly studied the persistence of invariant tori of twist mappings
with perturbation only on the action variable, namely of the following f orm

wheregis assumed to be of class C333. He stated a diﬀerentiable invariant curve theorem, which
also is of great importance for the study of stability of periodic solut ions. An analytic invariant curve
theorem was provided in [ 34] by Siegel and Moser. Concentrating on ﬁnitely diﬀerentiable case, Svanidze
established a KAM theorem for twist mappings in [ 35]. The version of class Cαwithα >4 and the
optimal situation of class Cαwithα >3 about mappings on the annulus were due to R¨ ussmann [ 28]
and Herman [ 12,13], respectively. For relevant works on the existence of invariant to ri of voluming-
preserving mappings, see Cheng and Sun [ 4] (3−dimensional), Feng and Shang [ 10], Shang [ 33] and
Xia [37] (n≥3). Cong et al [ 8] gave the persistence of the invariant tori when considering mapp ings
with the intersection property, which has diﬀerent numbers of act ions and angular variables. Levi and
Moser [17] gave a Lagrange proof of the invariant curve theorem for twist m appings using the method

1introduced by Moser[ 23]. The invariantcurvetheorem for quasi-periodicreversiblemapping s wasstudied
by Liu [20]. For some reversible mappings, see Sevryuk’s book [ 31]. Recently, Yang and Li [ 39], Zhao
and Li [40] have extended the existence of invariant tori to resonance sur faces of twist mappings and
multiscale mappings, respectively. Apart from above, Liu and Xing [ 21] presented a new proof of Moser’s
theorem for twist mappings with a parameter.
Among the KAM theory for Hamiltonian systems, the preservation o f prescribed frequency is also
important in studying invariance of dynamics under small perturbat ions, see Salamon [ 30] for instance,
especiallywithoutcertainnondegeneracysuchasKolmogorovorR¨ ussmannconditions,seeDuetal[ 9]and
Tong et al [ 36]. However, as generally known, the frequency of dynamical syste ms may have a drift eﬀect
bytheperturbationsduringtheKAMiteration, andthereforeitisin deeddiﬃcult tofrequency-preserving.
To the best of our knowledge, there are no KAM results for twis t mappings on this aspect, no one knows
whether the prescribed frequency could be preserved for an i nvariant torus. In this paper, we will touch
this question. To this end, it is necessary to propose some transve rsality conditions involving topological
degree condition as well as certain weak convexity condition to over come the drift of frequency, see [ 9,36]
and the references therein. Based on them, we will establish the KA M persistence with frequency-
preserving for twist mappings with intersection property. The so- called intersection property is that any
torus close to the invariant torus of the unperturbed system inte rsects its image under the mapping.
More precisely, denote by Tn=Rn/2πZnthen-dimensional torus, and let E⊂Rnbe a connected closed
bounded domain with interior points. Then consider the twist mapping F:Tn×E→Tn×Rnwith
intersection property
F:/braceleftBigg
θ1=θ+ω(r)+εf(θ,r,ε),
r1=r+εg(θ,r,ε),(1.1)
where the perturbations fandgare real analytic about ( θ,r) onTn×E,ωis assumed to be only
continuous about ronE, andεis a suﬃciently small scalar. By introducing parameter translation
technique, we prove in Theorem 3.1the persistence of invariant tori of such a family of twist mappings
with the frequency unchanged under small perturbations, and as a byproduct, this gives rise to the
ﬁrst result for Moser’s theorem with frequency-preserving .Moreover, using similar approach, we also
investigate the perturbed mapping F:Tn×Λ→Tnwith parameter
F:θ1=θ+ω(ξ)+εf(θ,ξ,ε), (1.2)
provided with Λ the same as E, andεis a suﬃciently small scalar. The perturbation fis analytic about
θonTn, andonly continuity with respect to the parameter ξ∈Λ is assumed for fandω.Under such
weak settings, we show the unexpected frequency-preservin g KAM persistence via transversality conditions
in Theorem 3.2.As an explicit example, one could deal with irregular perturbations, s uch as nowhere
diﬀerentiable systems.
Thispaperis organizedasfollows. Section 2introducessomebasicnotationson modulusofcontinuity.
In Section 3, we state Theorem 3.1with frequency-preserving for twist mapping ( 1.1) satisfying the
intersection property. When n= 1, we obtain Moser’sinvariantcurvetheorem with frequency-pre serving,
see Corollary 3.1. Theorem 3.2concerns mapping ( 1.2) with only angular variables, and shows the
persistence of invariant torus with frequency-preserving, wher e the perturbation f(θ,ξ,ε) is real analytic
aboutθ, continuous about the parameter ξ, and the frequency ω(ξ) is also continuous about ξ. To
emphasize the weak regularity, we provide Corollary 3.2with nowhere H¨ older about parameter. Some
discussions involving parameter without dimensional limitation problem are also given in Section 3. The

out a series of decreasing domains for frequency, we construct a translation to keep frequency unchanged
during the iterative process. In addition, we have to construct a c onjugate mapping to overcome the loss
of intersection property. Finally, Section 5is devoted to the proof of our main results.
22 Preliminaries
To describe only continuity, we ﬁrst introduce some deﬁnitions in this section, involving the modulus of
continuity and the norm based on it.
Deﬁnition 2.1. A modulus of continuity is denoted as ̟(x), which is a strictly monotonic increasing
continuous function on R+that satisﬁes
lim
x→0+̟(x) = 0,
and
lim
x→0+x
̟(x)<+∞.
Deﬁnition 2.2. Let a modulus of continuity ̟be given. A function f(x)is said to be ̟continuous
aboutx, if
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤̟(|x−y|),∀0<|x−y| ≤1.
It is well known that a mapping deﬁned on a bounded connected close d set in a ﬁnite dimensional
space must admit a modulus of continuity, see [ 11,14]. For example, for a function f(x) deﬁned on
[0,1]⊂R1, it automatically admits a modulus of continuity
̟f(x) := sup
y∈[0,1],0<|x−y|≤1|f(x)−f(y)|.
We therefore only concentrate on modulus of continuity througho ut this paper, especially in Theorem
3.2.
Next we will introduce the comparison relation between the strengt h and the weakness of modulus of
continuity.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Assume̟1,̟2are two modulus of continuity. We say ̟1is to be not weaker than ̟2
if
lim
x→0+̟1(x)
̟2(x)<+∞,
and denote it as ̟1≤̟2(or̟2≥̟1).
Remark 2.1. (a) If the function fis real analytic about xon a bounded closed set, then fis naturally
continuously diﬀerentiable with xof order one. Obviously, one has |f(x)−f(y)| ≤c|x−y|for some
c >0independent of x,y, that is, there exists a modulus of continuity ̟1(x) =xwith
|f(x)−f(y)| ≤c̟1(|x−y|),∀0<|x−y| ≤1.
(b) The classical α-H¨ older case corresponds to modulus of continuity ̟α
H(x) =xαwith some 0< α <1,
and the Logarithmic Lipschitz case ̟LL(x)∼(−logx)−1asx→0+is weaker than arbitrary α-
H¨ older continuity, that is, ̟α
H(x)≤̟LL(x). Both of them characterise regularity weaker than that
of Lipschitz.
It needs to be pointed out that, the regularity of the majority of f unctions is indeed very weak from
the perspective of Baire category, such as nowhere diﬀerentiable . In fact, the nowhere diﬀerentiable
regularity could be even worse. More precisely, we present the follo wing theorem constructing very weak
continuity, one can see details from Theorem 7.2 in [ 36].
Theorem 2.1. Given a modulus of continuity ̟1, there exists a function f(actually, a family) on R
and a modulus of continuity ̟2≥̟1, such that fis̟2continuous, but nowhere ̟1continuous.
Remark 2.2. These kind of functions are usually constructed by trigonom etric series admitting self-
similarity, similar to Weierstrass function and so on.
3Remark 2.3. As a direct application, we can construct a family of functio ns, which are nowhere Lipschitz
or even nowhere H¨ older continuous.
Finally, in order to specify the norm based on the modulus of continuit y, we need to give the domains
of the variables in detail. Throughout this paper, let
D(h) :={θ∈Cn: Reθ∈Tn,|Imθ| ≤h},
G(s) :={r∈Cn: Rer∈E,|Imr| ≤s}
be the complex neighborhoods of TnandEfor given h,s >0. For each vector r= (r1,···,rn)∈Rn, we
denote by |r|thel1-norm of r:
|r|=|r1|+···+|rn|.
Also, for ease of notation, we write D(h,s) :=D(h)×G(s). Next we introduce the norm deﬁned as
follows.
Deﬁnition 2.4. For the perturbation function f(θ,r,ε), which is real analytic about (θ,r)∈ D(h,s), one
can also claim that f(θ,r,ε)is̟1(x) =xcontinuous about rdue to Remark 2.1, deﬁne its norm as
follows
||f||D(h,s):=|f|D(h,s)+[f]̟1,
where
|f|D(h,s)= sup
(θ,r)∈D(h,s)|f(θ,r)|,
and
[f]̟1= sup
θ∈D(h)sup
r′,r′′∈G(s)
0<|r′−r′′|≤1|f(θ,r′,ε)−f(θ,r′′,ε)|
̟1(|r′−r′′|).
Remark 2.4. As to weaker continuity described by certain modulus of cont inuity̟≥̟1, one only
needs to change ̟1to̟in the norm accordingly.
3 Main results
This section is divided into two parts, namely stating our main KAM resu lts as well as giving some
further discussions.
3.1 Frequency-preserving KAM
Before starting, let us make some preparations. Following Remark 2.1, there exists a modulus of con-
tinuity̟1(x) =xsuch that fandgare automatically ̟1continuous about r. Besides, the following
assumptions are crucial to our KAM theorems.
(A1) Let p∈Rnbe given in advance and denote by E◦the interior of E. Assume that
deg(ω(·),E◦,p)/\e}atio\slash= 0. (3.1)
(A2) Assume that ω(r∗) =pwith some r∗∈E◦by (3.1), and
|/a\}bracketle{tk,ω(r∗)/a\}bracketri}ht−k0| ≥γ
|k|τ,∀k∈Zn\{0}, k0∈Z,|k0| ≤M0|k|,
whereγ >0,τ > n−1 is ﬁxed, and M0is assumed to be the upper bound of |ω|onE.
4(A3) Assume that B(r∗,δ)⊂E◦withδ >0 is a neighborhoodof r∗. There existsa modulus ofcontinuity
̟2such that
|ω(r′)−ω(r′′)| ≥̟2(|r′−r′′|), r′,r′′∈B(r∗,δ),0<|r′−r′′| ≤1.
Via these assumptions, we are now in a position to present the followin g KAM theorem for twist
mapping with intersection property, which is the ﬁrst frequency-preserving result on Moser’s th eorem to
the best of our knowledge.
Theorem 3.1. Consider mapping (1.1)with intersection property. Assume that the perturbations are
real analytic about (θ,r), and the frequency ωis continuous about r. Moreover, (A1)-(A3)hold. Then
there exists a suﬃciently small ε0, a transformation Wwhen0< ε < ε 0. The transformation Wis a
conjugation from FtoˆF, andˆF(θ,r) = (θ+ω(r∗),r−˜r)is the integrable rotation on Tn×Ewith
frequency ω(r∗) =p, where˜ris the translation about the action rresulting from the transformation W,
and the constant ˜r→0asε→0. That is, the following holds:
W◦ˆF=F◦W.
Whenn= 1, consider the area-preserving mapping of the form ( 1.1), which obviously satisﬁes
the intersection property. Correspondingly, we obtain Moser’s inv ariant curve theorem with frequency-
preserving as stated in the following corollary.
Corollary 3.1. Consider mapping (1.1)forn= 1. Assume that the perturbations are real analytic about
(θ,r), and the frequency ωis continuous and strictly monotonic concerning r. Moreover, (A2)and(A3)
hold. Then there exists a suﬃciently small ε0, a transformation Wwhen0< ε < ε 0. The transformation
Wis a conjugation from FtoˆF, andˆF(θ,r) = (θ+ω(r∗),r−˜r)is the integrable rotation on T×E
with frequency ω(r∗) =pforp∈ω(E◦)◦ﬁxed, where ˜ris the translation about rresulting from the
transformation W, and the constant ˜r→0asε→0. That is, the following holds:
W◦ˆF=F◦W.
Besidesconcentratingontwistmappingswithaction-angularvariab les,Herman[ 12,13]ﬁrstconsidered
the smooth mappings that contain only angular variables. It inspires us to investigate the perturbed
mappings on Tnas well. We therefore consider the following mapping F:Tn×Λ→Tndeﬁned by
θ1=θ+ω(ξ)+εf(θ,ξ,ε), (3.2)
whereθ∈Tn=Rn/2πZn,ξ∈Λ⊂Rnis a parameter, Λ is a connected closed bounded domain with
interior points, and εis a suﬃciently small scalar. Assume that the perturbation f(θ,ξ,ε) is real analytic
aboutθ, continuous about the parameter ξ, and the frequency ω(ξ) is continuous about ξ. We will prove
that mapping ( 3.2) has an invariant torus with the frequency unchanged during the it eration process.
Moreover, the assumptions (B1)-(B3) corresponding to (A1)-( A3) are respectively
(B1) Let q∈Rnbe given in advance and denote by Λ◦the interior of the parameter set Λ. Assume that
deg(ω(·),Λ◦,q)/\e}atio\slash= 0. (3.3)
(B2) Assume that ω(ξ∗) =qwith some ξ∗∈Λ◦by (3.3), and
|/a\}bracketle{tk,ω(ξ∗)/a\}bracketri}ht−k0| ≥γ
|k|τ,∀k∈Zn\{0}, k0∈Z,|k0| ≤M1|k|,
whereτ > n−1,γ >0 andM1is assumed to be the upper bound of |ω|on Λ.
5(B3) Assume B(ξ∗,δ)⊂Λ◦withδ >0 is the neighborhood of ξ∗. There exists a modulus of continuity
̟2with̟1≤̟2such that
|ω(ξ′)−ω(ξ′′)| ≥̟2(|ξ′−ξ′′|), ξ′,ξ′′∈B(ξ∗,δ),0<|ξ′−ξ′′| ≤1.
Similar to Theorem 3.1, we have the following theorem on Tn,where the parameter-dependence for
the perturbations is shown to be only continuous. This result is new, and unexpected, thanks to the
parameter translation technique introduced in [ 9,36] as we forego.
Theorem 3.2. Consider mapping (3.2). Assume that the perturbation f(θ,ξ,ε)is real analytic about θ
onD(h),̟1continuous about ξonΛ, andωis continuous about ξonΛ. Moreover, (B1)-(B3)hold.
Then there exists a suﬃciently small ε0, a transformation Uwhen0< ε < ε 0. The transformation U
is a conjugation from FtoˆF, andˆF(θ) =θ+ω(ξ∗)is the integrable rotation on Tn×Λwith frequency
ω(ξ∗) =q. That is, the following holds:
U◦ˆF=F◦U. (3.4)
The main diﬀerence between Theorems 3.1and3.2is that the analyticity of the perturbation f
aboutrcan be used in Theorem 3.1to ensure that fis at least Lipschitz continuous about r, that is,
there exists a modulus of continuity ̟1(x) =x. In fact, it prohibits us from extending rto complex
strips in the KAM scheme if fis assumed to be only continuous about r. However, for Theorem 3.2
we consider the case where there is no action variable rbut only parameter ξ. In this situation, the
perturbation fbeing continuous about ξis enough, and we will employ condition (B3) directly in the
proofof frequency-preserving. Explicitly, the parameter-depe ndencefor fcould be veryweak, such as the
arbitrary α-H¨ older continuity ̟α
H(x) =xαwith any 0 < α <1, then̟2in (B3) being the Logarithmic
Lipschitz type ̟LL(x)∼(−logx)−1asx→0+allows for Theorem 3.2due to Remark 2.1. Actually,
in view of Theorem 2.1, we could deal with the case which admits extremely weak regularity, at least
nowhere diﬀerentiable. In order to show the wide applicability of Theo rem3.2, we directly give the
following corollary.
Corollary 3.2. Consider mapping (3.2), where the perturbation f(θ,ξ,ε)is assumed to be real analytic
aboutθonD(h)and continuous about ξonΛ, but nowhere H¨ older continuous, the frequency mapping
ω(ξ)is continuous about ξonΛ. Besides, assume that (B1)-(B3)hold with certain ̟2weaker than the
modulus of continuity ̟1automatically admitted by fwith respect to ξ. Then the conjugacy (3.4)in
Theorem 3.2holds as long as ε >0is suﬃciently small.
Remark 3.1. One could construct explicit applications following Examp le 7.5 in [ 36] and we omit here
for simplicity.
3.2 Further discussions
Here we make some further discussions, including how to touch the p arameter without dimension limita-
tion problemunder ourapproach,aswell asthe importanceofthe w eakconvexityin preservingprescribed
frequency.
3.2.1 Parameter without dimension limitation
The parameter without dimension limitation problem, as is known to all, is fundamental and diﬃcult in
KAM theory, especially using the classical digging frequency method . More precisely, both the angular
variable and the action variable have dimensions of n, but the dimension of the parameter may be less
thann. We will touch this question by employing our parameter translation t echnique. To this end, let
us start with a discussion of the topological conditions (A1) and (B1 ).
As can be seen in the proof, these conditions are proposed to ensu re that the new parameters ˆ rν+1
andξν+1could be found in the next KAM step, while the prescribed frequencie s remain unchanged due
6to frequency equations ( 4.18) and (5.8), see (4.19) and (5.9) respectively. Here we have used the fact that
the non-zero Brouwer degree does not change under small pertu rbations from the KAM iteration, and
therefore the solvability of the frequency equations (( 4.18) and (5.8)) remains. Actually, the continuity of
the frequency mapping ω(ξ) with respect to parameter ξis enough to guarantee this, see the new range
conditions that can replace the topological conditions (A1) and (B1) below:
(A1*) Let p=ω(r∗)∈˜Ω⊂Rnsatisfy the Diophantine condition in (A2), where ˜Ω is an open set of
ω(Ω), and Ω ⊂E⊂Rnis open.
(B1*) Let q=ω(ξ∗)∈˜Ω⊂Rnsatisfy the Diophantine condition in (B2), where ˜Ω is an open set of
ω(Ω), and Ω ⊂Λ⊂Rmis open. Here 1 ≤m≤+∞could be diﬀerent from n.
One notices that ω−1(˜Ω) is also an open set due to the continuity of ω. As a result, as long as the
perturbations in KAM are suﬃciently small, the solvability of the frequ ency equations ( 4.18) and (5.8)
do not change thanks to the continuity of ω(note that we avoid the boundary of range), and the
uniform convergence of {rν}and{ξν}could still be obtained by Cauchy theorem through weak convexity
conditions (A3) and (B3). Besides, the Brouwer degree requires t hat the domain of deﬁnition and range
of mapping should be of the same dimension, while the range condition ( A1*) and (B1*) removes this
limitation. Consequently, we directly give the following conclusion.
Theorem 3.3. Replace(A1)and(B1)with(A1*)and(B1*)respectively, leaving the other assumptions
unchanged. Then the frequency-preserving KAM persistence in Theorem 3.1, Corollary 3.1, Theorem 3.2
and Corollary 3.2is still allowed. Especially, for Theorem 3.2and Corollary 3.2related to perturbed
mapping with parameter, the dimension of parameter could be diﬀerent from that for angular variable.
3.2.2 Weak convexity
We end this section by making some comments on our weak convexity c onditions (A3) and (B3). Such
conditions were ﬁrstly proposed in [ 9,36] to keep the prescribed frequency in Hamiltonian systems un-
changed, and were shown to be unremovable in the sense of frequency-pr eserving, see the counterexample
constructed in [ 9].Although the KAM theorems of the mapping form are somewhat diﬀer ent from the
former, the weak convexity conditions still ensure frequency-pr eserving KAM persistence, as shown in
Theorems 3.1and3.2.

In this section, we will show details of one cycle of KAM steps. Throug hout this paper, cis used to

4.2.2 Transformation
ForFν, onDν+1, introduce a transformation Uν+1:= id+( Uν+1,Vν+1) that satisﬁes

where id denotes the identity mapping. Since

Also, one has
Fν:

θ1
ν=θν+ω0(r0)+fν(θν,rν,ε),

rν=rν+1+Vν+1(θν+1,rν+1−ν/summationtext
i=0r∗
i).
By the right side of ( 4.3), we obtain
θ1
ν=θν+ω0(r0)+fν(θν,rν,ε)
=θν+1+Uν+1(θν+1,rν+1−ν/summationdisplay

+gν(θν+1+Uν+1,rν+1+Vν+1,ε).
Therefore, ( 4.3) implies that
ω0(r0)+¯fν+1(θν+1,rν+1,ε)+Uν+1(θν+1+ω0(r0)+¯fν+1,rν+1−ν/summationdisplay
i=0r∗

i=0r∗

=Vν+1(θν+1,rν+1−ν/summationdisplay
i=0r∗
i)+gν(θν+1+Uν+1,rν+1+Vν+1,ε). (4.5)
11Following the iteration process before, the ω0(r0) on the right side of ( 4.5) is actually
ω0(r0) =ω0(rν)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(rν).
Since the frequency ω0is continuous about r, assume that there exists a modulus of continuity ̟∗such
that
[ω0]̟∗=|ω0(rν)−ω0(rν+1)|
̟∗(|rν−rν+1|)<+∞. (4.6)
The perturbation fis̟1continuous about rwith̟1≤̟∗due to̟1(x) =x, one has
[f0,i]̟1=|f0,i(rν)−f0,i(rν+1)|
̟1(|rν−rν+1|)<+∞,0≤i≤ν−1. (4.7)
Consequently, from ( 4.6) and (4.7), we may deduce that
ω0(rν) =ω0(rν+1)+O(̟∗(|Vν+1|)),
and
f0,i(rν) =f0,i(rν+1)+O(̟1(|Vν+1|)).

The transformation Uν+1= id+(Uν+1,Vν+1) needs to satisfy the homological equations

The homological equations ( 4.8) are uniquely solvable on Dν+1. Let us start by considering the ﬁrst
equation in ( 4.8). Formally, denote Uν+1(θν+1,rν+1−ν/summationtext
i=0r∗
i) as
Uν+1(θν+1,rν+1−ν/summationdisplay
i=0r∗

0<|k|≤Kν+1Uk,νei/angbracketleftk,θν+1/angbracketright,

0<|k|≤Kν+1fk,νei/angbracketleftk,θν+1/angbracketright.
By comparing the coeﬃcients above, we have
Uk,ν+1(ei/angbracketleftk,ω0(r0)/angbracketright−1) =fk,ν. (4.11)
The details of estimating ( 4.11) can be seen in the following lemma.
Lemma 4.3. The equation (4.11)has a unique solution Uk,ν+1onG(sν+1)satisfying the following
estimate
||Uk,ν+1||G∗≤c2||fν||D4γ−1
0|k|τe−|k|(hν+1+3
4(hν−hν+1)).
Proof.We notice that the coeﬃcients fk,νdecay exponentially, i.e.,
||fk,ν||G∗∗≤ ||fν||D4e−|k|(hν+1+3
4(hν−hν+1)).
There exists a k0∈Zsatisfying |/angbracketleftk,ω0(r0)/angbracketright−k0

Therefore,

In the same way, we get

Thus,
||Vk,ν+1||G∗≤||gk,ν||G∗∗

0|k|τe−|k|(hν+1+3

4.2.3 Translation
In the usual iteration process, one has to ﬁnd out a decreasing se ries of domains that the Diophantine
condition fails. To avoid this, we will construct a translation to keep t he frequency unchanged in this
section. Consider the translation
Vν+1:θν+1→θν+1, rν+1→rν+1+r∗
ν+1:= ˆrν+1,
where ˆrν+1∈Bcµν(ˆrν). The action has a shift under the translation Vν+1, but the angular variable is
unchanged. To make the frequency-preserving, it requests tha t
ω0(ˆrν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrν+1)−ω0(r0)+ω0(r0) =ω0(r0),
i.e.,
ω0(ˆrν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrν+1) =ω0(r0).
We will demonstrate the equation in the following subsection. After t he translation Vν+1, the mapping
¯Fν+1becomes Fν+1=¯Fν+1◦Vν+1, i.e.,
Fν+1:

θ1

i+gν+1(θν+1,ˆrν+1,ε).
The corresponding new perturbations are

144.2.4 Frequency-preserving
In this section, we will show that the frequency is unchanged during the iteration process under the
conditions (A1) and (A3). The topological degree condition (A1) st ates that we can ﬁnd a ˆ rν+1such
that the frequency remains preserved. Besides, the weak conve xity condition (A3) ensures that {ˆrν}is a
Cauchy sequence. The following lemma is crucial to our consideration .
Lemma 4.4. Assume that
(H2) ||ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i||G(sν+1)≤cµ1
2
0.
Then there exists a ˆrν+1∈Bcµν(ˆrν)such that
ω0(ˆrν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrν+1) =ω0(r0). (4.16)
Proof.The proof is an induction on ν. Obviously, ω0(r0) =ω0(r0) whenν= 0. Now assume that for
someν≥1, one has
ω0(ˆrj)+j−1/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrj) =ω0(r0),ˆrj∈B(ˆrj−1)⊂B(r0,δ),1≤j≤ν. (4.17)
We need to ﬁnd out a ˆ rν+1in the neighborhood of ˆ rνthat satisﬁes
ω0(ˆrν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrν+1) =ω0(r0). (4.18)
Sinceµ1

0is suﬃciently small and the condition (A1) holds, we have
deg/parenleftBig
ω0(·)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(·),B(r0,δ),ω0(r0)/parenrightBig
= deg(ω0(·),B(r0,δ),ω0(r0))/\e}atio\slash= 0, (4.19)
whereω0(r0) =p, andp∈Rnis given in advance. This shows that there exists at least a ˆ rν+1∈B(r0,δ)
with some δ >0 such that ( 4.16) holds. Remark 2.1tells us that there exists a modulus of continuity
̟1(x) =xsuch that fis̟1continuous about r, and following ( 4.1), one has
[f0,i]̟1≤cµi,0≤i≤ν,
i.e.,
|f0,i(ˆrν+1)−f0,i(ˆrν)| ≤cµi̟1(|ˆrν+1−ˆrν|),0≤i≤ν.
Following Deﬁnitions 2.1and2.3, and together with (A3), one has
lim
x→0+x
̟2(x)<+∞,
this means ̟1≤̟2. The equations ( 4.17) and (4.18) imply that
ω0(ˆrν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrν+1) =ω0(ˆrν)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆrν).
Then
|f0,ν(ˆrν+1)|=|ω0(ˆrν)−ω0(ˆrν+1)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0(f0,i(ˆrν)−f0,i(ˆrν+1))|
15≥ |ω0(ˆrν)−ω0(ˆrν+1)|−ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0|f0,i(ˆrν)−f0,i(ˆrν+1)|
≥̟2(|ˆrν−ˆrν+1|)−c(ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0µi)̟1(|ˆrν−ˆrν+1|)
≥̟2(|ˆrν−ˆrν+1|)
2.
The last inequality holds since εis suﬃciently small such that c(ν−1/summationtext
i=0µi)≤1
2, and̟1≤̟2. Therefore,
|ˆrν−ˆrν+1| ≤̟−1
2(2|f0,ν(ˆrν+1)|)≤̟−1
2(2cµν)≤c̟−1
1(2cµν)≤cµν, (4.20)
where the last inequality is due to Deﬁnition 2.1, i.e.,lim
x→0+x
̟1(x)<+∞. This implies that {ˆrν}is a
Cauchy sequence and ˆ rν+1∈Bcµν(ˆrν).
4.2.5 Estimates on new transformations
According to ( 4.12) and (4.13), the estimates on transformations are given in the lemma below.
Lemma 4.5. Assume that there exists a constant c3, and
(H3) c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1)≤min{sν+1,hν−hν+1

Then the followings hold.
(i)||Uν+1−id||D3≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1).
(ii)Uν+1:Dν+1→ Dν.
(iii)SetWν+1:=Uν+1◦Vν+1, one has Wν+1:Dν+1→ Dν, and
||Wν+1−id||Dν+1≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1).
Proof.(i) Since Uν+1(θν+1,rν+1−ν/summationtext
i=0r∗
i) =/summationtext
0<|k|≤Kν+1Uk,ν+1ei/angbracketleftk,θν+1/angbracketright, we get
||Uν+1||D3≤ ||Uk,ν+1||G∗/summationdisplay
0<|k|≤Kν+1e|k|(hν+1+1

≤ ||fν||D4γ−1

0<|k|≤Kν+1|k|τe−|k|hν−hν+1

≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1). (4.21)
Besides,
||Vν+1||D3≤ ||Vk,ν+1||G∗/summationdisplay
0<|k|≤Kν+1e|k|(hν+1+1
2(hν−hν+1))
≤ ||gν||D4γ−1

0<|k|≤Kν+1|k|τe−|k|hν−hν+1
4
≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1). (4.22)
Thus, (i) is due to ( 4.1), (4.21), and (4.22).
16(ii) By (θν+1,rν+1)∈D3, (H3) implies that
|θν−θν+1|=||Uν+1||D3
≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1)
≤hν−hν+1
4,
|rν−rν+1|=||Vν+1||D3
≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1)
≤sν+1.
Thus, Uν+1:Dν+1⊂D4→D3⊂ Dν.
(iii) now follows from (i) and (ii) immediately.
4.2.6 Estimates on the new perturbations
In what follows, we are able to show the estimates on the new pertur bations.
Lemma 4.6. Assume that
(H4) γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1)≤̟−1
∗(γn+m+1
0sm
νµ2
ν).
Then there exists a constant c4such that
||¯fν+1||Dν+1+||¯gν+1||Dν+1
≤c4γn+m+2
0sm
νµ2
ν(γn+m+1
0sm
ν(hν+1−hν+2)−1Γ(hν−hν+1)+γn+m+1
0sm−1
νΓ(hν−hν+1)+1).
Moreover, if
(H5) 2mc4µ1−ρ
ν(γn+m+1
0sm
ν(hν+1−hν+2)−1Γ(hν−hν+1)+γn+m+1
0sm−1
νΓ(hν−hν+1)+1)≤1,
then
||fν+1||Dν+1+||gν+1||Dν+1≤γn+m+2
0sm

Proof.Note that ¯fν+1and ¯gν+1are solved by the implicit function theorem from ( 4.9) and (4.10). Thus,
||¯fν+1||Dν+1≤c||∂θν+1fν||ˆDν+1||Uν+1||Dν+1+c||∂rν+1fν||ˆDν+1||Vν+1||Dν+1
+c||RKν+1fν||Dν+1+c̟∗(|Vν+1|), (4.23)
where̟1(|Vν+1|)≤̟∗(|Vν+1|) is due to ̟1≤̟∗.
The intersection property implies that there exists a θ0
ν+1such that for each r0
ν+1∈G(sν+1), one has
¯gν+1(θ0
ν+1,r0
ν+1,ε) = 0,
i.e.,
sup
θν+1∈D(hν+1)||¯gν+1(θν+1,rν+1,ε)||
= sup

1
2||¯gν+1||Dν+1≤ ||¯gν+1−g0,ν||Dν+1.
Therefore,
||¯gν+1||Dν+1≤c||¯gν+1−g0,ν||Dν+1

Following ( 4.23), (4.24), (H4), and estimates obtained earlier, we have

4.3 The preservation of intersection property
In the previous Section 4.2.3, we have constructed a translation Vν+1such that the frequency ω0(r0)
unchanged. The translation Vν+1truns¯Fν+1intoFν+1=¯Fν+1◦Vν+1but drops the intersection
property. For this purpose, we construct the conjugation of ¯Fν+1such that it has the same properties
as¯Fν+1. Denote by ˆFν+1the conjugation of ¯Fν+1, that is, ˆFν+1=V−1
ν+1◦¯Fν+1◦Vν+1, where
V−1
ν+1:θ1
ν+1→θ1
ν+1,ˆr1
ν+1→ˆr1
ν+1−r∗
ν+1.
Therefore, ˆFν+1has the form
ˆFν+1:

θ1
ν+1=θν+1+ω0(r0)+fν+1(θν+1,ˆrν+1,ε),
ˆr1
ν+1= ˆrν+1−ν+1/summationtext
i=0r∗
i+gν+1(θν+1,ˆrν+1,ε).
It ensures that the mapping ˆFν+1still has the intersection property.
5 Proof of the main results
In this section, we will show the proof of Theorem 3.1, Corollary 3.1and Theorem 3.2successively.
185.1 Proof of Theorem 3.1
5.1.1 Iteration lemma
The iteration lemma guarantees the inductive construction of the t ransformations in all KAM steps. Let
s0,h0,γ0,µ0,F0,D0be given in Section 4.1, and set K0= 0,r∗
0= 0, 0< ρ <1 is a constant. We deﬁne
the following sequences inductively for all ν= 0,1,2,···.

Lemma 5.1. Consider mapping (1.1)forν= 0,1,2,···. Ifε0is suﬃciently small such that (H1)−(H5)
hold, and
||fν||Dν+||gν||Dν≤γn+m+2
0sm
νµν,
then the iteration process described above is valid, and the following properties hold.
(i)There exists a real analytic transformation Wν+1:=Uν+1◦Vν+1that satisﬁes Wν+1◦ˆFν+1=
ˆFν◦Wν+1, where
ˆFν+1:

θ1
ν+1=θν+1+ω0(r0)+fν+1(θν+1,ˆrν+1,ε),
ˆr1
ν+1= ˆrν+1−ν+1/summationtext
i=0r∗
i+gν+1(θν+1,ˆrν+1,ε).
Also, the transformation Wν+1has the estimate
||Wν+1−id||Dν+1≤c3γn+m+1
0sm
νµνΓ(hν−hν+1). (5.1)
(ii){ˆrν}is a Cauchy sequence and
|ˆrν+1−ˆrν| ≤cµν.
(iii)The estimate on new perturbations is
||fν+1||Dν+1+||gν+1||Dν+1≤γn+m+2
0sm
ν+1µν+1.
Proof.The proof is an induction on ν. It is easy to see that we can take suﬃciently small ε0to ensure
that (H1) −(H5) hold. Since
ˆFν+1=V−1
ν+1◦¯Fν+1◦Vν+1
=V−1
ν+1◦(U−1
ν+1◦ˆFν◦Uν+1)◦Vν+1,
andWν+1=Uν+1◦Vν+1, we have that Wν+1◦ˆFν+1=ˆFν◦Wν+1. For the estimate ( 5.1) in (i), see
Lemma4.5. In addition, we notice that (ii) is due to ( 4.20), and (iii) follows from Lemma 4.6.
195.1.2 Convergence
Observe that
ˆFν+1=W−1
ν+1◦ˆFν◦Wν+1

ν+1◦W−1
ν◦ˆFν−1◦Wν◦Wν+1

Denote
Wν+1:=W1◦W2◦···◦ Wν+1,
then (5.2) implies that
Wν+1◦ˆFν+1=F0◦Wν+1.
The transformation Wν+1is convergent since
||Wν+1−Wν||Dν+1=||W1◦···◦ Wν◦Wν+1−W1◦···◦ Wν||Dν+1
≤ ||Wν||Dν||Wν+1−id||Dν+1

Therefore, lim
ν→∞Wν:=W, as well as F∞= lim
ν→∞ˆFν, we thus deduce that
W◦F∞=F◦W.
It remains to consider the following convergence. By Lemma 4.4, one has
ω0(ˆr1)+f0,0(ˆr1) =ω0(r0),
ω0(ˆr2)+f0,0(ˆr2)+f0,1(ˆr2) =ω0(r0),
...
ω0(ˆrν)+f0,0(ˆrν)+···+f0,ν−1(ˆrν) =ω0(r0). (5.4)
Taking limits on both sides of ( 5.4), we obtain
ω0(ˆr∞)+∞/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ˆr∞) =ω0(r0) =ω(r∗),
that is, for given r∗∈E◦, the mapping F∞onD∞becomes the integrable rotation

r1
∞=r∞−˜r,
whereω(r∗) =p, andpis given in advance. Besides, ˜ r=∞/summationtext
i=0r∗
i→0 asε→0. This completes the proof
of the frequency-preserving KAM persistence in Theorem 3.1.
205.2 Proof of Corollary 3.1
This subsection is devoted to the proof of Corollary 3.1. We will show that the assumption on ω(r)
here contains the transversality condition (A1). In fact, the fre quency mapping ω(r) is injective on E◦,
and consequently, it is surjective from E◦toω(E◦). Therefore it is a homeomorphism and by Nagumo’s
theorem, we have that the Brouwer degree deg( ω,E◦,p) =±1 for some p∈ω(E◦)◦. Finally, by applying
Theorem 3.1we directly obtain the desired frequency-preserving KAM persiste nce in Corollary 3.1.
5.3 Proof of Theorem 3.2
This section outlines the proof of Theorem 3.2. We focus on describing the parts of the proof of Theorem
3.2that diﬀer from those of Theorem 3.1. We shall see that ̟1≤̟2is used directly by assumption
(A3) in the process of proving Lemma 5.2. Moreover, there is no need to construct a conjugation of ¯Fν+1
since the mapping we considered in Theorem 3.2does not have the intersection property. The parts we
leave out in this section are similar to those described in Section 4.
Consider the mapping F:Tn×Λ→Tndeﬁned by
θ1=θ+ω(ξ)+εf(θ,ξ,ε),
whereξ∈Λ⊂Rnis a parameter, Λ is a connected closed bounded domain with interior p oints. For
θ0∈D(h0), andξ0∈Λ0:={ξ∈Λ| |ξ−ξ0|<dist (ξ0,∂Λ)}, denote
θ1
0=θ0+ω(ξ0)+f0(θ0,ξ0,ε),
whereω(ξ0) =ω(ξ∗) =qfor given q∈Rnin advance and f0(θ0,ξ0,ε) =εf(θ0,ξ0,ε). The estimate on
||f0||D(h0)is
||f0||D(h0)≤γn+m+2
0µ0,
if
ε3
4ε−1
8η(m+1)||f||D(h0)≤1.
Set
Λν:={ξ: dist (ξ,∂Λν−1)< µν−1}, ν∈N+.
Suppose that after νKAM steps, for θν∈D(hν) andξν∈Λν, the mapping becomes
θ1
ν=θν+ω(ξ0)+fν(θν,ξν,ε),
and one has
||fν||D(hν)≤γn+m+2
0µν.
Introduce a transformation Uν+1:= id + Uν+1that satisﬁes Uν+1◦¯Fν+1=Fν◦Uν+1. Then the
conjugation ¯Fν+1of mapping Fνis
¯Fν+1:θ1
ν+1=θν+1+ω(ξ0)+¯fν+1(θν+1,ξν,ε).
We obtain the homological equation
Uν+1(θν+1+ω(ξ0))−Uν+1(θν+1) =TKν+1fν(θν+1,ξν,ε), (5.5)
and the new perturbation
¯fν+1(θν+1,ξν,ε) =fν(θν+1+Uν+1,ξν,ε)−fν(θν+1,ξν,ε)+RKν+1fν(θν+1,ξν,ε)
+Uν+1(θν+1+ω(ξ0),ξν,ε)−Uν+1(θν+1+ω(ξ0)+¯fν+1,ξν,ε).
The homological equation ( 5.5) is uniquely solvable on D(hν+1), and the new perturbation ¯fν+1can be
solved by the implicit function theorem.
21To keep the frequency unchanged, construct a translation
Vν+1:θν+1→θν+1,˜ξν→˜ξν+ξν+1−ξν, (5.6)
whereξν+1is to be determined. This translation changes the parameter alone, and the mapping becomes
Fν+1=¯Fν+1◦Vν+1, that is,
Fν+1:θ1
ν+1=θν+1+ω(ξ0)+fν+1(θν+1,ξν+1,ε),
where the frequency ω(ξ0) =ω(ξν+1)+ν/summationtext
i=0f0,i(ξν+1). The following lemma states that the frequency is
preserved.
Lemma 5.2. Assume that
(H6) ||ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξν)||Λν≤cµ1
2
0.
Then there exists a ξν+1∈Bcµν(ξν)⊂Λ0such that
ω(ξν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξν+1) =ω(ξ0).
Proof.The proof is an induction on ν∈N. Whenν= 0, obviously, ω(ξ0) =ω(ξ0). When ν≥1, let
ω(ξj)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξj) =ω(ξ0), j= 1,2,···,ν, (5.7)
then
ω(ξν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξν+1) =ω(ξ0) (5.8)
needs to be veriﬁed. Taking the assumptions (B1) and (B3), one ha s
deg/parenleftBigg
ω(ξν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξν+1),Λ0,ω(ξ0)/parenrightBigg
= deg(ω(ξν+1),Λ0,ω(ξ0))/\e}atio\slash= 0. (5.9)
This means that there exists at least one parameter ξν+1∈Λ0such that ω(ξν+1)+ν/summationtext
i=0f0,i(ξν+1) =ω(ξ0)
holds. Next, let us verify that ξν+1∈Bcµν(ξν)⊂Λν. From (5.7) and (5.8), one has
ω(ξν)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξν) =ω(ξν+1)+ν/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξν+1),
i.e.,
f0,ν(ξν+1) =ω(ξν)−ω(ξν+1)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0(f0,i(ξν)−fi(ξν+1)).
Since||fi||D(hi+1)≤γn+m+2
0µifor each i≥0, one has [ f0,i]̟1≤cµi. Therefore,
|f0,i(ξν)−f0,i(ξν+1)| ≤cµi̟1(|ξν−ξν+1|).
Following (A3), we have
|f0,ν(ξν+1)|=|ω(ξν)−ω(ξν+1)+ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0(f0,i(ξν)−f0,i(ξν+1))|
22≥ |ω(ξν)−ω(ξν+1)|−ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0|f0,i(ξν)−f0,i(ξν+1)|
≥̟2(|ξν−ξν+1|)−c̟1(|ξν−ξν+1|)ν−1/summationdisplay
i=0µi
≥̟2(|ξν−ξν+1|)
2.
The last inequality is due to ̟1≤̟2, andεis suﬃciently small such that c(ν−1/summationtext
i=0µi)≤1
2. Thus,
|ξν−ξν+1| ≤̟−1
2(2|f0,ν(ξν+1)|)≤̟−1
2(2cµν)≤̟−1
1(2cµν)≤cµν, (5.10)
which is similar to ( 4.20). Moreover,
|ξν+1−ξ0| ≤ν/summationdisplay
i=0|ξi+1−ξi| ≤cν/summationdisplay
i=0µi≤2cµ0.
The above illustrates that {ξν}is a Cauchy sequence and ξν+1∈Bcµν(ξν)⊂Λ0.
We now summarize the standard convergence. Denote
Uν+1:=U1◦···◦ Uν+1,
and
Wν+1:=W1◦···◦ Wν+1:= (U1◦V1)◦···◦(Uν+1◦Vν+1).
Both of them are convergent, one therefore has U:= lim
ν→∞UνandW:= lim
ν→∞Wν. Moreover, we get
ω(ξ∞)+∞/summationdisplay
i=0f0,i(ξ∞) =ω(ξ0) =ω(ξ∗) =q
forξ∗∈Λ◦ﬁxed. For ( 3.4), we know that the conjugation for dynamical system ( 3.2) only focuses on the
angular variable θ∈Tn. As mentioned in ( 5.6), the angular variable is unchanged under the translation.
Therefore, one has
U◦F∞=F◦U,
hereF∞denotes the limit of FνonD∞. More precisely, one obtains the integrable rotation
F∞:θ1
∞=θ∞+ω(ξ∗)
with frequency ω(ξ∗) =q, whereqis given in advance. In other words, we prove the KAM persistence
with prescribed frequency-preserving. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.
