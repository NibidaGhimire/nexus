Abstract : In many clinical settings, an active-controlled trial design (e.g., a non-inferiority or
superiority design) is often used to compare an experimental medicine to an active control (e.g., an
FDA-approved, standard therapy). One prominent example is a recent phase 3 efficacy trial, HIV
Prevention Trials Network Study 084 (HPTN 084), comparing long-acting cabotegravir, a new HIV
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agent, to the FDA-approved daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
plus emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) in a population of heterosexual women in 7 African countries. One key
complication of interpreting study results in an active-controlled trial like HPTN 084 is that the placebo
arm is not present and the efficacy of the active control (and hence the experimental drug) compared
to the placebo can only be inferred by leveraging other data sources. In this article, we study statistical
inference for the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of the active control using relevant historical placebo-
controlled trials data under the potential outcomes (PO) framework. We highlight the role of adherence

1 Introduction
1.1 HIV Prevention Trials Network Study 084: A landmark clinical trial in HIV prevention
The HIV Prevention Trials Network Study 084 (HPTN 084) is a phase 3, double-blind, random-
ized trial comparing long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA), an intramuscular injectable, long-acting
form of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention, to daily oraltenofovir disoproxil
fumarate plus emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) among HIV-uninfected, heterosexual women (Delany-
Moretlwe et al., 2022). The study was conducted in 7 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, including
Botswana, Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Daily oral TDF/FTC
(sold under the brand name TruvadaTM), a World Health Organization (WHO) recommended PrEP
for HIV prevention, has been introduced in these countries; however, despite increasing availability
and access to oral PrEP in the region, women have faced considerable barriers, including social
stigma, judgement and violence (Delany-Moretlwe et al., 2022), to daily pill-taking, which partly
explained why the global HIV prevention efforts have stalled with nearly 1.5 million new HIV
infections in 2021, or 4,000 every day, a statistic nearly the same as in 2020. High-risk popula-
tions, especially those facing barriers to adhering to the daily oral PrEP, are in urgent need of a
long-acting prevention modality like injectible CAB-LA with a dosing schedule of every 8 weeks.
HPTN 084 reported an HIV incidence of 0.20 per 100 person-years in the CAB-LA arm compared
to 1.86 per 100 person-years in the daily TDF/FTC arm (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.31),
demonstrating, unequivocally , the superiority of CAB-LA compared to the daily oral TDF/FTC
(see Figure S5 in Web Appendix E). Not long after this landmark trial, WHO recommended that
“long-acting injectable cabFotegravir (CAB-LA) be offered as an additional HIV prevention option
2for people at substantial risk of HIV infection” (World Health Organization, 2022).
1.2 Active-controlled trial; intention-to-treat effect; sources of heterogeneity and bias
An important aspect of the HPTN 084 study is its adoption of an active-controlled trial design.
Active-controlled trials are commonly used in clinical settings to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
of an experimental medication compared to a standard therapy (referred to as an active control and
abbreviated as AC) when it is unethical to randomize patients to placebo and deprive them of the
available standard therapies (Ellenberg and Temple, 2000). Two popular choices of active-controlled
trial designs are a superiority design and a non-inferiority (NI) design. In an active-controlled trial
design (superiority or non-inferiority), the placebo arm is not present, so it is not straightforward
to estimate the intention-to-treat (ITT) effect of the active control compared to the placebo in the
active-controlled trial population (Fleming et al., 2011).
There are two motivations for understanding the ITT effect of an active control compared to the
placebo in an active-controlled trial. First, in the design stage of a non-inferiority trial, a key design
factor is to select a so-called NI margin, defined as an acceptable loss of efficacy comparing the
experimental therapy with the AC in the NI trial population. The current standard practice is to
set the NI margin to a fraction of the assumed ITT effect of the AC; hence, a better understanding
of AC’s ITT effect facilitates selecting a rigorous and scientifically justifiable NI margin (Rothmann
et al., 2003; James Hung et al., 2003; Fleming et al., 2011). Second, in a post-hoc analysis of the
active-controlled trial data, the ITT effect of AC versus placebo can be used to establish the ITT
effect of the experimental drug versus placebo. The ITT effect of an experimental drug plays a key
role in designing future trials to evaluate other experimental drugs, where the current experimental
drug may serve as active-control comparator. In addition, it provides evidence to quantify the
experimental drug’s public health impact and facilitates comparison of the experimental drug to
other therapeutics. Lastly, the ITT effect of the experimental drug helps evaluate how much
society should be willing to pay for the improved efficacy of the experimental drug compared to
AC. For instance, Neilan et al. (2022) evaluated the cost-effectiveness of CAB-LA using the Cost-
Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications model and a key model parameter in this analysis is
the ITT effect of CAB-LA versus placebo. What’s more, additional HIV prevention modalities, like
an HIV vaccine (Fauci, 2017) and monoclonal antibodies (Miner et al., 2021), are currently under
3development. The placebo-controlled intention-to-treat effect of CAB-LA serves as an important
benchmark to these new interventions.
There are at least three sources of heterogeneity that complicate generalizing an AC’s ITT ef-
fect from any historical, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to the planned active-controlled trial.
First, the actual treatment effect of the AC could be heterogeneous ( treatment effect heterogeneity ).
Second, within the same study, different participants could have different probability of adhering to
the assigned treatment ( within-trial compliance heterogeneity ); for example, in the field of HIV pre-
vention, it was reported that age was correlated with a person’s adherence to the prescribed PrEP
dose (Grant et al., 2014). Moreover, the same AC could be implemented differently across trials
and even the same participants could respond differently to distinct implementations ( between-
trial compliance heterogeneity ). Third, trials could target different populations, and therefore, key
demographic and health information could differ among trial populations ( target population hetero-
geneity ). An interplay among treatment effect heterogeneity, within- and between-trial compliance
heterogeneity, and target population heterogeneity may lead to generalization bias (Stuart et al.,
2011) of the ITT effect. In fact, ITT estimates of the same intervention often differ across historical
trials (see, e.g., Table S3 in Web Appendix E). In an editorial discussing discrepancies among these
findings, Cohen and Baden (2012) concluded:
Why the results differ across the various studies reported to date is unclear. However, important
considerations include the populations studied; the likely routes of HIV transmission (vaginal
vs. anal mucosa)...and most important, medication adherence by study participants.
Cohen and Baden’s (2012) comments echo three of the aforementioned sources of heterogeneity.
1.3 Current FDA guidelines; existing approaches; related literature; limitations
Current FDA guidelines for designing an NI trial recommend two strategies for estimating the
efficacy of an AC in the planned NI trial from historical evidence (Food and Drug Administration,
2016). First, one may choose a historical placebo-controlled trial of the AC and assume that its ITT
effect would remain unchanged in the target NI trial. This assumption is known as the “constancy
assumption” (Fleming et al., 2011) and is in general implausible considering the various sources of
heterogeneity previously discussed. Alternatively, one may employ a meta-analytical approach and
4derive an average estimate based on summary statistics of multiple historical trial results and a
random-effects model. The meta-analytical approach acknowledges the variability of ITT estimates
across historical trials and incorporates uncertainty quantification using a random effect; however,
the method is still largely ad hoc and is not underpinned by clear identification assumptions. Either
way, the FDA guidelines recommend acknowledging the unreliability of generalization and using a
“discounted” estimate as a means of protection against potential generalization bias.
Some authors acknowledge the important role of observed covariates in generalizing the intention-
to-treat effect, and have proposed covariate adjustment methods under a “conditional constancy”
assumption, that is, the intention-to-treat effect within the same strata of study participants (de-
fined by their observed covariates) is constant across trials (Zhang, 2009). Zhang et al. (2014)
develop a sensitivity analysis method that allows for residual inconstancy due to unmeasured con-
founding after adjusting for observed covariates. The conditional constancy assumption represents
a meaningful improvement upon the na¨ ıve constancy assumption and, to some extent, addresses
the target population heterogeneity; however, even the conditional constancy assumption is hard
to justify because of the across-trial compliance heterogeneity often arising from different AC im-
plementation strategies. Another unsolved issue concerns unmeasured confounders: What is the
precise role of unmeasured confounders in preventing generalization of the ITT effect?
Under the conditional constancy assumption, recent developments in the generalization and
transportation methods for causal inference could be directly leveraged to generalize the ITT from
a historical trial to the planned active-controlled trial (Stuart et al., 2011; Dahabreh et al., 2019);
see, e.g., Degtiar and Rose (2021) for a recent review. Pearl (2011, Section 6, Equation 24) discussed
identification of the causal effect in the presence of a post-randomization surrogate endpoint under
a sequential ignorability assumption (Joffe and Greene, 2009). Rudolph and van der Laan (2017)
proposed targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs) to transport the intention-to-treat
effect across populations under a version of the conditional constancy assumption. They also
proposed methods to transport the complier average treatment effect across trials. Unlike Rudolph
and van der Laan (2017), we will attempt to further link the complier average treatment effect back
to the intention-to-treat effect of the target population using a novel decomposition of estimand of
interest and by leveraging multiple data sources. As a result, the identification functional and the
estimators of our target parameter are different from those in Rudolph and van der Laan (2017).
5More recently, Dahabreh et al. (2022) discuss in detail unidentifiability of the ITT when there
are unmeasured common causes of trial participation and treatment, and interpretation of the
covariate-standardized ITT estimates (under the conditional constancy assumption) as estimating
the effects of joint interventions that scale-up the trial and assign the treatment. In the absence
of patient-level data, many authors have proposed meta-analysis-based approaches to estimating
causal effects accounting for noncompliance. For instance, Zhou et al. (2019) proposed a Bayesian
hierarchical modeling approach to estimating complier average treatment effects and Zhou et al.
(2022) proposed a closely related, frequentist approach that targets the same estimand.
1.4 Our contribution
In this article, we study how to estimate the ITT effect of an AC in an active-controlled trial
using relevant patient-level data from historical placebo-controlled trials of the AC. We adopt the
potential outcomes (PO) framework (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974) and build upon the literature
on generalizing causal inference across clinical trials and/or observational studies (Stuart et al.,
2011; Dahabreh et al., 2019) and instrumental variable (IV) methods (Angrist et al., 1996). We
discuss different identification assumptions that permit both point and partial identification under
this unified framework. One key assumption in our development is a version of the homogeneity
assumption extensively discussed in the IV literature (see, e.g., Swanson et al., 2018 and references
therein), which illuminates the role of unmeasured confounding and disentangles multiple sources of
heterogeneity. Our developed framework allows for assessing and quantifying what FDA guidelines
refer to as non-statistically-based uncertainties (Food and Drug Administration, 2016, Page 20) and
places many “essential considerations” raised in Fleming et al. (2011) in the context of formal causal
identification assumptions. Compared to the constancy and conditional constancy assumptions, our
identification assumptions are more concrete and could facilitate more informed discussions among
stakeholders including scientists, physicians, statisticians, funding agencies and regulators.
We propose historical-data-driven estimators that point or partially identify the target param-
eter using relevant historical trials and under different identification assumptions. We assess the
finite-sample performance of proposed estimators in simulation studies and discuss strategies for
assorted sensitivity analyses. We apply our proposed estimators to estimating the ITT effect of
daily oral TDF/FTC against placebo in the HPTN 084 study using data from this trial and an
6earlier, historical placebo-controlled trial of daily oral TDF/FTC (Baeten et al., 2012).
2 Notation and framework
2.1 Potential outcomes
We consider the potential outcomes framework (Angrist et al., 1996) to formalize a placebo-
controlled trial with noncompliance involving an active control (AC) and a placebo (P). Let
Zi∈ {0,1}denote a binary treatment assignment (0 for placebo and 1 for AC), and Di(Zi=
zi)∈ {0,1}the potential treatment received had the unit ibeen assigned the treatment Zi=zi.
Each study participant has a pre-specified probability of receiving either treatment (AC or P).
A study participant with {Di(1), Di(0)}={1,0}complies with the treatment assignment and is
referred to as a complier. A participant with {Di(1), Di(0)}={1,1}is referred to as an always-
taker, {Di(1), Di(0)}={0,0}a never-taker, and {Di(1), Di(0)}={0,1}a defier (Angrist et al.,
1996). We have assumed the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) in the definition
ofDi(Zi=zi) so that a study participant’s treatment received depends only on the person’s own
treatment assignment (Rubin, 1980; Angrist et al., 1996). Each unit is also associated with po-
tential outcomes {Yi(di, zi), di∈ {0,1}, zi∈ {0,1}}where we again assume the SUTVA in this
definition. Under the exclusion restriction assumption, we further have Yi(di, zi) =Yi(di), that is,
the treatment assignment affects the outcome only via the actual treatment received. Next, we
assume Zis randomly assigned and is “relevant” in the sense that E[D(Z= 1)−D(Z= 0)]̸= 0.
The SUTVA, exclusion restriction, relevance, and random assignment will be referred to as “core IV
assumptions” in the rest of the article. Without imposing additional assumptions, a participant’s
compliance class, that is, if the person is a complier, an always-taker, a never-taker, or a defier, is
not identified from observed data alone. For instance, a participant who was offered daily oral TD-
F/FTC but did not take it could either be a never-taker or a defier. Some researchers have proposed
additional assumptions to further simplify the compliance categories. For instance, Angrist et al.
(1996) rule out the defiers under the monotonicity assumption that states Di(Zi= 1)≥Di(Zi= 0).
Another typical assumption is to assume that those assigned placebo cannot cross over to the active
treatment so Di(Zi= 0) = 0; this setting is referred to as “one-sided noncompliance” in the litera-
ture and exclude defiers and always-takers. We do not a priori make these additional assumptions,
though we will consider these as important special cases.
7We use the indicator Sto denote the trial membership of a participant: S=tif a participant is
in the target active-controlled trial; S=hif a participant is in a generic historical placebo-controlled
trial. In the later development, we will also explore scenarios where data from two historical trials
may be leveraged; in this case, we will use h1andh2to distinguish distinct historical trials.
Regardless of trial membership, each participant is associated with a vector of baseline covariates
X. We will use Ptto denote the joint distribution of Xin the target trial and Phthat in the
historical trial h. We use EX∈Pt[·] andEX∈Ph[·] to denote taking expectation over PtandPh.
2.2 Estimands
We define estimands of interest using the notation introduced above. The conditional intention-
to-treat effect of AC versus P in the target active-controlled trial is defined as ITT(X;S= t) =
E[Y(Z= 1)−Y(Z= 0)|X, S= t]. Averaging the stratum-specific effect ITT(X;S= t) over the
distribution of observed covariates X∈ P tthen yields the average intention-to-treat effect below:
ITT(S= t) = EX∈Pth
E
Y(Z= 1)−Y(Z= 0)|X, S= ti
, (1)
which is of primary scientific interest and hence our target parameter . As discussed in Section 1.2,
the NI margin and the ITT effect of the experimental drug can be immediately determined once
ITT(S= t) is determined. In parallel, we use ITT(X;S= t) = E[Y(Z= 1)−Y(Z= 0)|X, S= h]
to denote the conditional ITT effect of the AC in the historical placebo-controlled trial. The average
ITT effect of the AC in the historical trial is then obtained by averaging the stratum-specific ITT
effect over the historical trial population as follows:
ITT(S=h) =EX∈Phh
E
Y(Z= 1)−Y(Z= 0)|X, S=hi
, (2)
which was unbiasedly estimated in the historical placebo-controlled trial by virtue of randomization.
Two estimands are closely related to the ITT effect estimand. The average treatment effect, also
known as the causal ‘per-protocol effect’ (Hern´ an et al., 2017), is defined as ATE :=E[Y(D= 1)−
Y(D= 0)] and describes the average treatment effect of drug uptake, rather than drug assignment,
on the outcome. Unlike ITT,ATE is in general not identified even in a randomized, placebo-
controlled trial because, unlike Z,Dis not randomized. In the HPTN 084 study, the ITT effect is
more clinically relevant than the “per-protocol” effect because “noncompliance” or “non-adherence”
to daily pills is an important feature of daily oral prophylaxis and the key motivation to developing
8long-acting prevention modalities like CAB-LA, monoclonal antibodies (Miner et al., 2021) and
a HIV vaccine (Fauci, 2017). Another related estimand is the complier average treatment effect,
which describes the ATE among the latent complier subgroup under the monotonicity assumption
(Angrist et al., 1996). Compared to the ITT or ATE, the complier average treatment effect is
in general more challenging to be generalized because the complier group is latent and could be
altered under different circumstances.
2.3 The constancy assumption
The constancy assumption in the NI trial literature (Fleming et al., 2011) states the following
relationship between the ITT effect of AC in a target NI trial and that in a chosen historical trial:
Assumption 1 (Constancy) .LetITT(S=t)andITT(S=h)be defined as in (1)and (2),
respectively. The constancy assumption is said to hold if ITT(S=t) =ITT(S=h).
Another version of the constancy assumption, referred to as the conditional constancy assump-
tion (Zhang, 2009), states the following:
Assumption 2 (Conditional constancy) .LetXdenote a vector of observed covariates collected in
the planned NI trial, and ITT(X;S=t)andITT(X;S=h)denote conditional intention-to-treat
effects in the planned NI trial and the chosen historical trial, respectively. Then the conditional
constancy assumption is said to hold if ITT(X;S=t) =ITT(X;S=h).
It is transparent from definitions (1) and (2) that when trials enroll study participants from
different populations, that is, when Pt̸=Ph, then Assumption 1 could fail even when Assumption 2
holds. This has been discussed in great detail in the context of generalizability and transportability
by many authors; see, e.g., Dahabreh et al. (2019). Under Assumption 2, the intention-to-treat
effect in the planned active-controlled trial is identified from the observed data of the historical
trial S=h, and may be estimated using outcome regression, inverse-participation-weighting, or a
doubly-robust combination of both; see, e.g., Dahabreh et al. (2019, Section 5). Although weaker
than Assumption 1, Assumption 2 is still a strong assumption; it is, after all, a statement about the
intention-to-treat effect, not the actual treatment effect. Even when both interventions (AC and
P) are expected to have consistent treatment effects for similar study participants across different
9trials, interventions may be implemented differently, induce different compliance even among similar
study participants, and lead to different intention-to-treat effects. This is particularly true in HIV
prevention studies with daily oral PrEP (Cohen and Baden, 2012).
Finally, an assumption closely related to conditional constancy is described in Rudolph and
van der Laan (2017): E(Y|D, Z, X, S= t) = E(Y|D, Z, X, S=h). Unlike Assumption 2, this also
conditions on D(treatment taken). Although this may sometimes be more plausible than standard
conditional constancy, it is nevertheless difficult to interpret on its own, given that it concerns the
observed variables rather than potential outcomes. Indeed, if there is any unmeasured treatment-
outcome confounding, it is not an assumption about the stability of the causal effect of DonY
but rather the non-causal conditional association, which may be harder to motivate.
3 Identification assumptions; a road map for estimation and sensitivity analysis
In this section, we replace the constancy assumption with a set of assumptions regarding effect
homogeneity and generalizability that would permit either point or partial identification of the
target parameter. These assumptions are not necessarily weaker than the constancy assumption;
however, they are transparent, problem-specific, and more amenable to being assessed and critiqued.
They also motivate the estimation procedures and associated sensitivity analyses.
3.1 No-interaction/homogeneity-type assumption
Intuitively, a statement about the intention-to-treat effect implicitly entails a statement about the
compliance structure (that is, how people comply or not comply with the prescribed treatment) and
the actual treatment effect (that is, the effect of the treatment had the study participant taken the
treatment). To establish a more revealing relationship, we employ some version of a homogeneity
or no-interaction assumption. There are several no-interaction-type identification assumptions that
help link the intention-to-treat effect to the average treatment effect; see, e.g., Swanson et al. (2018,
Section 5). Below, we adopt one version from Wang and Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018).
Assumption 3 (No-interaction) .LetUdenote unmeasured covariates that confound D’s effect on
Y. The no-interaction assumption holds if there is no additive U-Dinteraction in E[Y(D)|X, U]:
E[Y(D= 1)|X, U]−E[Y(D= 0)|X, U] =E[Y(D= 1)|X]−E[Y(D= 0)|X]. (Assumption 3a)
10orno additive U-Zinteraction in E[D(Z)|X, U]:
E[D(Z= 1)|X, U]−E[D(Z= 0)|X, U] =E[D(Z= 1)|X]−E[D(Z= 0)|X] (Assumption 3b)
Assumption 3 holds if either Assumption 3a or Assumption 3b holds. Assumption 3a holds
if there are no more modifiers of D’s effect on Ybeyond those captured by X. Assumption 3a
does nothold, for instance, if some genetic factor is suspected to modify D’s effect on Y. Fleming
et al. (2011) describe an example where the effect of epidermal growth factor receptor-inhibiting
drugs in colorectal cancer patients depends strongly on whether tumors express the wild type or
the mutated version of the KRAS gene. In this example, the KRAS gene ( U) modifies the effect of
drug ( D) on colorectal cancer ( Y), and Assumption 3a fails in an analysis not accounting for it.
Assumption 3 also holds if Assumption 3b holds, that is, when the unmeasured modifier of
D’s effect on Ydoes not interact with the treatment assignment Zin predicting the treatment
received. In the colorectal cancer example, Assumption 3 would still stand if the KRAS gene does
notinteract with a colorectal cancer patient’s treatment assignment in predicting whether or not
the patient adheres to the prescribed treatment conditional on the observed covariates X(possibly
including some easier-to-measure aspects of the tumor). This appears to be more reasonable, at
least in some applications.
Assumption 3 is a generic assumption that could be applied to either the target AC trial S=t
or a historical trial S=h. Assumption 3, when applied to the hypothetical placebo-controlled trial
in the planned active-controlled trial population, implies the following decomposition:
ITT(X;S=t) =E[Y(D= 1)−Y(D= 0)|X, S=t]| {z }
CATE (X;S=t)×E[D(Z= 1)−D(Z= 0)|X, S=t],| {z }
CC(X;S=t)(3)
where the term CATE (X;S=t) describes the average treatment effect of AC versus P conditional
on a study participant’s covariates, and the conditional compliance term CC(X;S=t) describes the
effect of treatment assignment on treatment received conditional on a study participant’s covariates,
both in the planned active-controlled trial.
3.2 Conditional average treatment effect; mean generalizability
To link the active-controlled trial to historical trials, we make the following mean generalizability
(also known as mean exchangeability) assumption (Stuart et al., 2011; Dahabreh et al., 2019):
11Assumption 4 (Mean generalizability/exchangeability) .CATE (X;S=t):=E[Y(D= 1)−
Y(D= 0)|X, S=t] =E[Y(D= 1)−Y(D= 0)|X, S=h]:=CATE (X;S=h).
Assumption 4 essentially says that study participants with the same covariate profile Xwould
experience the same average treatment effect of DonYin the hypothetical trial and the selected
historical trial S=h. The major difference between Assumption 4 and Assumption 2 is that
Assumption 4 is a statement about the actual treatment effect rather than the intention-to-treat
effect . Assumption 4 is in some sense the minimal assumption needed to extend inference from a
historical trial cohort to a target population (Dahabreh et al., 2019, Section 3).
Assumption 4 can still be violated if there exists multiple versions of an active control or placebo
across trials (i.e., Rubin’s SUTVA is violated); for instance, this could happen if the active control
therapy employed in a historical trial is different from that in the planned active-controlled trial due
to difference in dosage or ancillary therapies (Fleming et al., 2011; Food and Drug Administration,
2016). For Assumption 4 to hold, researchers should select a historical trial whose active control
is as similar as possible to the planned active-controlled trial (e.g., both investigating the same
medication at the same dose with near-identical ancillary therapies). It is important to note that
Assumption 4 only requires that the AC therapy itself is identical between trials, not the methods
of implementation or dissemination. A sensitivity analysis that models CATE (X;S=t) as a
fraction of CATE (X;S=h) should be considered when Assumption 4 is suspected not to hold.
Identification of the conditional average treatment effect from a historical placebo-controlled
trial, i.e., CATE (X;S=h), has been discussed extensively in the literature. Two identification
strategies are available. First, point identification could be achieved by further imposing Assump-
tion 3 on the selected historical trial. Alternatively, CATE (X;S=h) ispartially identified under
different sets of identification assumptions, including minimal, core IV assumptions (see, e.g., Swan-
son et al. (2018) for a recent review).
3.3 Conditional compliance
The conditional compliance term is a difference between CCAC(X;S=t):=E[D(Z= 1)|X, S=t]
andCCP(X;S=t):=E[D(Z= 0)|X, S=t]. It then suffices to identify each term separately.
The former term equals E[D|X, S=t, Z= 1] and is identified based on the compliance data
from the active-controlled trial by virtue of randomization. The latter term CCP(X;S=t) is not
12identified from the active-controlled trial, but may be estimated using relevant historical trial data
under the following placebo-arm compliance generalizability assumption:
Assumption 5 (Placebo-arm compliance generalizability/exchangeability) .E[D(Z= 0)|X, S=
t] =E[D(Z= 0)|X, S=h].
Note that E[D(Z= 0)|X, S=h] =E[D|X, S=h, Z = 0] is directly estimable from historical
trial data by randomization. Alternatively, researchers may do a sensitivity analysis for CCP(X)
by varying it from 0 to a sensible value. For instance, if the active control therapy is not available
in the AC trial population, then one would reasonably set CCP(X) = 0. Researchers may also vary
CCP(X) in a sensitivity interval centered around E[D|X, S=h, Z = 0]. Either way, instead of
outputting a point estimate of CCP(X) and CC(X), one may output a plausible range of them.
In applications where the intention-to-treat effect of AC is an important design factor, e.g., when
selecting the NI margin in the design phase of the NI trial, researchers do not have compliance data
from the NI trial and need to identify the entire conditional compliance term using data from a
historical trial under the following mean compliance generalizability assumption:
Assumption 6 (Mean compliance generalizability/exchangeability) .E[D(Z= 1)−D(Z= 0)|
X, S=t] =E[D(Z= 1)−D(Z= 0)|X, S=h].
By randomization of Z, the quantity E[D(Z= 1)−D(Z= 0)|X, S=h] equals E[D|X, S=
h, Z = 1]−E[D|X, S=h, Z = 0] and is directly estimable from historical trial data. In order
for Assumption 6 to hold (or approximately hold), the selected historical trial should have a near-
identical implementation strategy of the AC as in the active-controlled trial. Researchers are also
advised to relax Assumption 6 in a sensitivity analysis that varies the conditional compliance term
in a sensitivity interval around E[D(Z= 1)−D(Z= 0)|X, S=h].
3.4 Summary of identification strategies and non-statistically-based uncertainties
Figure 1 in Web Appendix summarizes four aspects we have discussed so far: (i) identification
assumptions, including those necessary to identify causal quantities in a trial with non-compliance,
and those necessary to generalize inference across trials, (ii) quantities involved in the estimation
procedure, (iii) different modes of identification, including point versus partial identification, and

identification using historical trials data alone versus using historical trials data and partial active-
controlled trial data, and (iv) sensitivity analyses relaxing core assumptions. Together, they help
quantify what FDA guidelines refer to as “ non-statistically-based uncertainties ” (Food and Drug
Administration, 2016, Page 20). We next discuss statistically-based uncertainties , that is, those
associated with sampling variability, by formally proposing estimators for the target parameter.
4 Estimation and inference
We consider two scenarios for estimation and inference, each corresponding to one major scientific
objective of estimating the ITT effect of the AC versus placebo. We first consider the design stage
where researchers have access to data from the historical trial S=h1,Dh1={(Xi, Zi, Di, Yi, Si=
h1):i= 1, . . . , N 1}, data from a second historical trial S=h2,Dh2={(Xi, Zi, Di, Si=h2):i=
N1+1, . . . , N 1+N2}, and baseline covariates data from the target AC trial Dt={(Xi, Si=t):i=
N1+N2+ 1, . . . , N 1+N2+N}. Researchers will attempt to leverage the historical data in S=h1
to estimate CATE (X;S=t) and data in S=h2to estimate CC(X;S=t). In this scenario,
we write D=Dh1∪ Dh2∪ Dt, where |D|denote its cardinality. We next consider a more stylistic
14case where the interest lies in estimating the ITT effect of the AC and hence the experimental
therapy versus placebo in an post hoc analysis after seeing the compliance data from the target
AC trial. In this case, researchers would have access to data Dh1as mentioned previously plus
dataDt={(Xi, Zi, Di, Si=t):i=N1+ 1, . . . , N 1+N}from the target AC trial. In this second
scenario, we write D=Dh1∪ Dt.
4.1 Estimation and inference in the design stage
We first consider the task of estimating the causal estimand ITT(S=t) in the design stage and
derive a simple, regression-based, historical-data-driven estimator under Assumption 3 (for both
S=tandS=h1), Assumption 4 and Assumption 6. Under Assumption 3, the conditional average
treatment effect in the trial S=h1, i.e., CATE (X;h1), is identified as follows:
E[Y(D= 1)−Y(D= 0)|X, S=h1] =E[Y|X, S=h1, Z= 1]−E[Y|X, S=h1, Z= 0]
E[D|X, S=h1, Z= 1]−E[D|X, S=h1, Z= 0]
=δY(X;h1)
δD(X;h1),(4)
where
δY(X;s) =E[Y|X, S=s, Z= 1]−E[Y|X, S=s, Z= 0],
δD(X;s) =E[D|X, S=s, Z= 1]−E[D|X, S=s, Z= 0].
The expression (4) is sometimes known as the conditional Wald estimand (Wang and Tchetgen Tch-
etgen, 2018). It also identifies the conditional complier average treatment effect, if we further as-
sume monotonicity in the historical trial (Angrist et al., 1996). Suppose that we obtain ˆδY(X;h1)
andˆδD(X;h1) by fitting correctly specified parametric models for E[Y|X, S=h1, Z=z] and
E[D|X, S=h1, Z=z] and that these models are indexed by finite-dimensional parameters which
are estimated, for instance, via standard maximum likelihood. Then a regression-based estimator
\CATE (X;h1) is obtained as \CATE (X;h1) =ˆδY(X;h1)/ˆδD(X;h1). As discussed by Wang and
Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018), a limitation of this approach with a binary outcome is that one may ob-
tain estimates of CATE (X;h1) outside of the [ −1,1] interval. A regression-based estimator of con-
ditional compliance in the historical trial h2can be analogously obtained as dCC(X;h2) =ˆδD(X;h2),
where ˆδD(X;h2) denotes an estimator for the unknown δD(X;h2) obtained from Dh2via parametric
regression modelling of E[D|X, S=h2, Z=z]. By averaging \CATE (X;h1) anddCC(X;h2) over
15X∈ Dt, we obtain the following regression-based estimator of ITT(S=t):
dITT full, reg =1
|Dt||D|X
i=11{Si=t} ×n
\CATE (Xi;h1)×dCC(Xi;h2)o
=1
|Dt||D|X
i=11{Si=t} ×ˆδY(Xi;h1)
ˆδD(Xi;h1)ˆδD(Xi;h2).(5)
By standard M-estimation theory (Stefanski and Boos, 2002), the estimator dITT full, reg is a consis-
tent and asymptotically normal estimator for the target parameter ITT(S=t) under identification
and modeling assumptions previously discussed. To obtain a confidence interval, one may use an
empirical sandwich variance estimator or the non-parametric bootstrap (Cheng and Huang, 2010).
The regression-based estimator dITT full, reg is expected to perform well if parametric models
are correctly specified. Below, we describe an estimator derived from semiparametric efficiency
theory (Bickel et al., 1993), which allows for more flexible estimation of nuisance functions using
modern statistical learning approaches, whilst still facilitating parametric-rate inference on the
target parameter. It is developed from the same general theory as recent developments in de-biased
machine learning (Chernozhukov et al., 2017) and targeted learning (van der Laan and Rose, 2011).
Recall that the target parameter ITT(S=t) can be expressed as the functional

.
Theorem 1 gives our main result on semiparametric inference.

16Although Mis a non-parametric model, the treatment assignment probabilities f(Z=z|X, S)
are known by design in our setting and in particular do not typically depend on X. Nevertheless,
it follows, e.g. from Hahn (1998), that knowledge of f(Z=z|X, S) in this case should not change
the bound. In contrast, one may be able to leverage information on f(S=s|X) to gain precision,
although we do not pursue this since such knowledge is not generally available.
To construct an estimator of ψbased on EIF ψ, one must estimate δY(X;h1),δD(X;h1) and
δD(X;h2), plus the additional nuisance functions µY,z(X;s),µD,z(X;s) and f(S=s|X). Al-
though f(Z|X, S=h1) is known, one typically uses the estimated version of it. One strategy
would be to develop a multiply robust approach similar to that in Wang and Tchetgen Tchet-
gen (2018), based on parametric working models for the nuisance functions. Here, we describe
an alternative approach, which allows for off-the-shelf methods to learn these quantities. These
could include classical non-parametric estimators (e.g. kernel smoothers, sieves) or potentially
more flexible statistical learning approaches (random forests, kernel ridge regression, Lasso, en-
semble methods). After obtaining estimates ˆδY(X;h1),ˆδD(X;h1),ˆδD(X;h2),ˆf(Z|X, S=s),
ˆf(S=s|X), ˆµY,0(X;h1) and ˆ µD,0(X;h2), one can then estimate ψas

Under regularity conditions, if each of the nuisance estimators converges to the truth with mean
squared error rate shrinking faster than n−1/4and certain Donkser conditions on the nuisance
functions hold (Van der Vaart, 2000), then dITT EIFisn1/2-consistent and asymptotically nor-
mal. Furthermore, supposing that E[D|X, S=h1, Z] is consistently estimated, the estimator is
asymptotically unbiased (although not necessarily n1/2-consistent) so long as one of the following
restrictions hold: (1) E[Y|X, S=h1, Z] and E[D|X, S=h2, Z] are consistently estimated; (2)
E[Y|X, S=h1, Z] and f(S|X) are consistently estimated; and (3) E[D|X, S=h2, Z] and f(S|X)
are consistently estimated. See Section 4.5 of Wang and Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018) for a discussion
about the robustness properties. Additional robustness may be attained by using doubly robust
17estimators for δY(X;h1),δD(X;h1) and δD(X;h2) and/or adopting the parametrizations in Wang
and Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018). An estimator of the asymptotic variance can be obtained using a
sandwich estimator. As discussed in Chernozhukov et al. (2017), if very flexible learning methods
are used, sample-splitting (estimating the nuisance functions on a training split, and ψon a test
split) or cross-fitting are recommended to alleviate the Donsker conditions.
4.2 Estimation and inference in the post hoc analysis
The previous results straightforwardly extend to the setting where one wishes to evaluate the
ITT effect of the AC versus placebo with data available from the target AC trial. In that
case, conditional compliance E[D(Z= 1)|X, S=t] can be identified under randomization as
µD,1(X;t):=E[D|X, S=t, Z= 1]. However, E[D(Z= 0)|X, S=t] cannot be identified as
straightforwardly, because there is no placebo arm in the AC trial. We will proceed here, as in
our case study, by treating E[D(Z= 0)|X, S=t] as a sensitivity parameter µ∗
D,0(X;t), such that
δD∗(X;t):=µD,1(X;t)−µ∗
D,0(X;t) and ˆδD∗(X;t):= ˆµD,1(X;t)−µ∗
D,0(X;t). In that case, the
identification functional is now
ψ=E"
δY(X;h1)
δD(X;h1)δD∗(X;t)|S=t#
.
Results on estimation follow closely along the lines described in the previous subsection. Indeed,
the regression-based estimators equal

|Dt||D|X
i=11{Si=t} ×ˆδY(Xi;h1)
ˆδD(Xi;h1)ˆδD∗(Xi;t). (6)

One can then estimate the ITT effect of the experimental therapy versus placebo in the target AC
trial population by adding one of the estimates described above to the estimated ITT comparison of
18the experimental therapy versus active control. Although the above developments treat µ∗
D,0(Xi;t)
as fixed, in practice, one may wish to very it based on a plausible range of values.
4.3 Extensions
Point identification of CATE (X;h1) requires imposing Assumption 3 or other homogeneity-type
assumptions on the historical trial S=h1(Swanson et al., 2018, Section 5.2). Alternatively, one
may proceed by constructing partial identification intervals [ L(X), U(X)] such that CATE (X;h1)∈
[L(X), U(X)] almost surely. A partial identification interval bounds the range of possible values
of the CATE (X;h1) that are consistent with the observed data. Unlike a confidence interval, a
partial identification interval would not shrink to a point even when the sample size goes to infinity,
as the true parameter may take a range of values and cannot be point identified. Depending on the
assumptions one is willing to make about the treatment assignment and treatment received, partial
identification bounds with difference width can be formulated (Swanson et al., 2018). We review
some estimation strategies for partial identification bounds in Web Appendix B for completeness.
We also construct partial identification bounds that are motivated by our case study in Section 6.
Web Appendix C also discusses some variants of the regression-based estimator and a sensitivity
analysis assessing Assumption 3.
5 Simulation study
5.1 Goal and structure
We consider data generating processes that have all three three sources of heterogeneity: treatment
effect heterogeneity, within- and across-trial compliance heterogeneity, and target population het-
erogeneity. We generate two historical datasets Dh1andDh2, and a hypothetical placebo-controlled
trial dataset Dtarget according to the following data generating process:
Sample sizes: N1=N2=N= 1000, 2000, and 5000.
Observed covariates and overlap: We consider the following two data generating processes for
X, one mimicking the case study ( Scenario X1 ) and the other following a standard multivariate
normal distribution ( Scenario X2 ).
Scenario X1: We sample with replacement HPTN 084 participants’ observed covariates to form
19Dtarget. We then sample Partners PrEP participants’ observed covariates to form Dh1andDh2
and control the amount of overlap between these two historical datasets and Dtarget using the
following biased sampling strategy. For each study participant in Partners PrEP, we estimate
a “probability of trial participation,” defined as the probability of selection into the HPTN
084 study over the Partners PrEP study based on a participant’s baseline characteristics (Cole
and Stuart, 2010; Stuart et al., 2011). This “probability of trial participation” is a version of
Rosenbaum and Rubin’s (1983) propensity score and captures the covariate balance between
the target and historical datasets. By over- and under-sampling participants in Partners PrEP
with large estimated “probability of participation,” we then control the amount of overlap
between datasets. Specifically, the historical dataset Dhjwas formed by sampling Nj,highand
Nj,lowparticipants with high (above 0 .5) and low (below 0 .5) probability of participation,
j= 1,2. We consider three overlap levels: (i) Poor overlap: N1,high= 0.1 N1,N1,low= 0.9 N1,
N2,high= 0.15 N2,N2,low= 0.85 N2; (ii) Limited overlap: N1,high= 0.19 N1,N1,low= 0.81 N1,
N2,high= 0.19 N2,N2,low= 0.81 N2; (iii) Sufficient overlap: N1,high= 0.4 N1,N1,low= 0.6 N1,
N2,high= 0.5 N2,N2,low= 0.5 N2. To illustrate, Figure S1 in Web Appendix D plots the overlap
of the probability of participation between Dtarget andDh1in overlap, poor, and sufficient
overlap scenarios when N1=N= 2000.
Scenario X2: We generate a 10-dimensional X∼Multivariate Normal ( µ,0.5·Id), where Id
is an identity matrix, µ= (c, c, c, 0, . . . , 0)TinDh2,µ= (1.2c,1.2c,1.2c,0, . . . , 0)TinDh1,
andµ= (0.8c,0.8c,0.8c,0, . . . , 0)TinDtarget, and c∈ {0,0.25,0.50}. Parameter ccontrols
the amount of overlap in this scenario.
Treatment assignment: Zis Bernoulli(0.5) in Dh1,Dh2andDtarget.
Treatment received: Dis Bernoulli with P(D(Z) = 1 |X) = expit {Z(2.5−0.1X1+ 0.3X2−
0.4X5)+(1−Z)(−0.3X1−0.4X5−1.5)}inDh2andDtarget, and expit {Z(2+0 .2X1−0.2X5)+
(1−Z)(−0.2X5−1)}inDh1, where expit( x) = exp( x)/(1 + exp( x)) is the inverse of the logit
function.
According to the above data generating process, the covariate distribution Xis distinct among Dh1,
Dh2, andDtarget (that is, target population heterogeneity exists) in Scenario X1 and in Scenario X2
20when c̸= 0. The effect of ZonDinDh1is different from that in Dh2andDtarget (that is, across-
trial compliance heterogeneity exists). Moreover, ( X1, X2) modify the effect of ZonDinDh2and
Dtarget (that is, within-trial compliance heterogeneity exists) so that the marginal compliance rate
is different between Dh2andDtarget.
Outcome: We consider two sets of data generating processes in Dh1andDh2: a linear data
generating process ( Scenario Y1 ):
P(Y(Z) = 1|X) =

expit{Z(2.6−0.6X1−0.8X2+ 0.4X3)+
(1−Z)(1.6−0.7X1−0.7X2+ 0.4X3−0.2X5)}inDh1,
expit{1.4−X1−0.6X2+ 0.4X3−0.6X5+ 3.5Z}inDh2,
and a nonlinear data generating process ( Scenario Y2 ):
P(Y(Z) = 1|X) =

expit{Z(2.6−0.6X1−0.8X2+ 0.4√X3)+
(1−Z)(1.6−0.7X1−0.7X3
2+ 0.4X3−0.2X5)}inDh1,
expit{1.4−X1−0.6√X2+ 0.4X3−0.6X5+ 3.5Z}inDh2.
In the hypothetical trial dataset Dtarget, we generated the potential outcome P(Y(Z= 0) = 1 |
X) = 0 and hence P(Y(Z= 1) = 1 |X) equals the conditional intention-to-treat effect which is a
product of the conditional average treatment effect in Dh1and the conditional compliance in Dh2.
The data-generating process also ensures that CATE (X;S=h1) is bounded between −1 and 1.
We considered 6 estimators of the intention-to-treat effect in the hypothetical placebo-controlled
trial including (i) a difference-in-means estimator dITT hypo based on the unobservable outcome
data in Dtarget, (ii) and (iii) two covariate-adjusted estimators that (incorrectly) assume the con-
ditional constancy assumption between Dtarget andDh1(dITT const ,1) and between Dtarget andDh2
(dITT const ,2), (iv) a historical-data-driven, regression-based estimator dITT reg, par , (v) a historical-
data-driven, EIF-based estimator dITT EIF, par with all nuisance parameters estimated via parametric
regression models, and (vi) a historical-data-driven, EIF-based estimator dITT EIF, gam with all nui-
sance parameters estimated via generalized additive models (Hastie, 2017). In each setting, we
repeat the simulation 1000 times.
215.2 Results
Figure S2 in Web Appendix D exhibits and compares the sampling distributions of 6 estimators
under consideration when the sample sizes are N1=N2=N= 2000, observed covariates are
generated according to Scenario X1 , and the outcomes are generated according to Scenario Y1 .
The ground truth intention-to-treat effects are superimposed using red dashed lines. The three
historical-data-driven estimators dITT reg, par ,dITT EIF, par , anddITT EIF, gam all closely resemble the
ground truth ITTs, though they have larger variances compared to that of the unobtainable, gold-
standard estimator dITT hypo. As the overlap between historical and target datasets improves, the
variance of each historical-data-driven estimator starts to shrink and the sampling distribution be-
comes more concentrated around the ground truth. Table 1 summarizes the percentage of bias and
coverage of 95% confidence intervals for different sample sizes and overlap levels. We encountered
simulated datasets where the estimator dITT EIF, gam became unstable due to the small weights
in the denominator, especially when the covariate overlap is poor. In these cases, we applied a
hard thresholding and let the estimator be ϕ(dITT EIF, gam ) where function ϕ(x) = 1 ,∀x≥1,
ϕ(x) =−1,∀x≤ −1, and ϕ(x) =xotherwise. The percentage of bias of dITT EIF, gam reported
in Table 1 is based on the truncated version. Similar to the impression delivered by Figure S2, in
all cases considered in this simulation study, three historical-data-driven estimators had small to
negligible biases. On the other hand, two estimators based on the incorrect conditional constancy
assumption ( dITT const ,1anddITT const ,2) were heavily biased and their confidence intervals’ coverage
was nowhere close to the nominal level. The bias that persists after adjusting for the observed co-
variates difference is often observed in empirical studies and referred to as ”residual confounding”
by Zhang et al. (2014). Our simulation exhibits concrete settings where such residual confounding
could emerge. The 95% confidence intervals for all but dITT EIF, gam were based on nonparametric
bootstrap. We found that the bootstrapped 95% CIs of dITT reg, par anddITT EIF, par approximately
attained their nominal level when sample sizes are as large as 2000 in each dataset. The boot-
strapped CIs of dITT EIF, gam were found to be highly conservative; on the other hand, the 95% CIs
obtained based on asymptotic normality and estimated asymptotic variances tended to undercover
when the overlap was poor and the sample size was small, but began to achieve nominal coverage
level when the overlap was sufficient and sample size was as large as 5000. In the Web Appendix
22D, we report simulation results when observed covariates were generated according to Scenario X2
and outcomes were generated according to Scenario Y1 andScenario Y2 . In the additional nonlin-
ear data generating process Scenario Y2 ,dITT EIF, gam continued to have negligible bias and good
coverage, while dITT reg, par became biased once the parametric models became misspecified.

6 Case study: Efficacy of daily TDF/FTC in HIV-1 prevention
6.1 Historical placebo-controlled trials of daily oral TDF/FTC
Our goal is to estimate the ITT effect of daily oral TDF/FTC versus placebo and then the ITT
effect of CAB-LA in the HPTN 084 trial population. We consider an integrated analysis of the
patient-level data from HPTN 084 and a historical placebo-controlled trial of daily oral TDF/FTC
using our proposed framework and methods. There are 3 large-scale, multicenter, randomized trials
that evaluated daily oral TDF/FTC: Partners PrEP (Baeten et al., 2012), FEM-PrEP (Van Damme
et al., 2012), and VOICE (Marrazzo et al., 2015). The FEM-PrRP and VOICE were conducted
in the heterosexual women population in multiple African countries, while the Partners PrEP
study enrolled HIV-uninfected heterosexual men and women who had a partner living with HIV
(i.e., HIV-1–serodiscordant heterosexual couples) from Kenya and Uganda. These three historical
studies recorded quite different annualized HIV incidence in the daily oral TDF/FTC arm. The
Partners PrEP study reported an incidence of 0 .95 per 100 person-years in the TDF/FTC arm
among heterosexual women (Baeten et al., 2012, Figure 3). On the other hand, both the FEM-
23PrEP study (Van Damme et al., 2012, Table 2) and the VOICE study (Marrazzo et al., 2015, Table
3) reported an incidence of 4 .7 per 100 person-years in the TDF/FTC arm. The annualized HIV
incidence was reported to be 1 .86 per 100 person-years in the TDF/FTC arm of the HPTN 084
study. In this integrated analysis, we chose the Partners PrEP study as the historical placebo-
controlled trial because the gap between the annualized HIV incidence rate in the TDF/FTC arm
between the Partners PrEP study and the HPTN 084 study, while still substantial, was considerably
smaller compared to the other two studies.
6.2 Overlap between the HPTN 084 and Partners PrEP trial populations; target population
We first examine the overlap between trial population of the HPTN 084 study and that of the
Partners PrEP study. Because the HPTN 084 study enrolled only female participants, we focused
on the female participants in the Partners PrEP study. Moreover, as the Partners PrEP study
enrolled heterosexual women who had a partner living with HIV, the study would not reveal the
ITT effect or the conditional average treatment effect of daily oral TDF/FTC for heterosexual
women whose partners did not live with HIV, if a partner’s HIV status is an important modifier
of the compliance pattern or the treatment effect. Therefore, instead of making inference for the
entire HPTN 084 population, we only focused on about one third of the HPTN 084 participants
whose partners either living with HIV or having an unknown HIV status as our target population.
The second and third columns in Table 2 summarize the baseline characteristics of study par-
ticipants in the target population of HPTN 084 and female participants in the Partners PrEP
study. Compared to those in Partners PrEP, participants in the HPTN 084 target population were
younger (mean age 26 .3 versus 33 .5) and received more education (46 .3% versus 6 .3% completing
the secondary school). HPTN 084 participants also had higher unemployment rate (75 .8% versus
31.8%), higher positivity rates of baseline diagnoses of gonorrhea (6 .0% versus 1 .2%), chlamydia
(16.3% versus 1 .1%) and trichomonas (7 .8% versus 6 .8%), and lower positivity rate of syphilis (2 .6%
versus 5 .8%). To help better summarize and visualize the covariate overlap between two popula-
tion, Figure S6 in the Web Appendix E exhibits the distributions of the estimated “probability of
participation” in the target HPTN 084 population and among female participants in the Partners
PrEP study (Cole and Stuart, 2010; Stuart et al., 2011). The plot suggests that there is overlap
between two populations across the spectrum of the “probability of participation,” although the
24overlap is limited so covariate adjustment is warranted.

The first column of Table 2 further exhibits the covariate distribution of the entire HPTN 084
study. We found that participants in the target population were similar to the entire HPTN 084
trial population in age, education, unemployment rate and baseline sexually transmitted infections;
nevertheless, because partners’ HIV status could be an important risk factor, we still restricted our
analysis to n= 1,139 participants whose partners lives with HIV or had an unknown status.
In addition to baseline characteristics of trial participants, self-reported adherence to the daily
pill-taking was also different in HPTN 084 and Partners PrEP. Consuming at least 80% of prescribed
pills was typically considered “adhering to the drug” in the HIV prevention literature (Murnane
et al., 2015). Adopting this definition, 80 .5% of daily TDF/FTC recipients adhered to the pre-
scription in the Partners PrEP Study, and this number was 52 .4% in the HPTN 084 study. In the
25HPTN 084 study, measurements of plasma tenofovir concentrations from a prespecified random
cohort of 405 study participants were obtained; 812 out of 1 ,939 samples (41 .0%) had tenofovir
concentrations consistent with daily use ( ≥40 ng/mL).

study. Right panel: Kaplan-Meier estimates of incident HIV acquisition among HPTN 084 partici-
pants whose partners either living with HIV or having an unknown HIV status (target population).
The right panel of Figure 2 plots the cumulative incidence curves in the CAB-LA and TDF/FTC
arms in the target population, while the left panel plots the cumulative incidence curves in the
TDF/FTC and placebo arms among heterosexual women in the Partners PrEP study. In view of
the difference in patient composition and adherence pattern, both the constancy and conditional
constancy assumptions are likely to be violated. Below, we seek to estimate the ITT effect of daily
oral TDF/FTC against placebo for the target population based on evidence from the Partners
PrEP study using the framework developed in the article.
6.3 Estimating the ITT effect of daily oral TDF/FTC in the target population: two approaches
We estimated the intention-to-treat effect of daily oral TDF/FTC against placebo in reducing HIV-
1 incidence in the target population under both point and partial identification frameworks. First,
we assume Assumption 3 holds for the Partners PrEP study and the hypothetical placebo-controlled
trial of daily oral TDF/FTC in the target population with the observed covariates including age,
employment status, education, and four comorbidties including gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas,
and syphilis. Under this assumption and Assumption 4, we estimated the average treatment effect
26of daily oral TDF/FTC against placebo conditional on observed baseline covariates based on the
Partners PrEP data. We then estimated the conditional compliance using the observed self-reported
adherence data in the TDF/FTC arm in the HPTN 084 study and by treating the probability that
a placebo recipient received daily oral TDF/FTC (i.e., CCP(X;S= HPTN 084)) as a sensitivity
parameter. In this way, if we assume no cross-over in the hypothetical placebo-controlled trial (i.e.,
CCP(X;S= HPTN 084) = 0), then the intention-to-treat effect of daily oral TDF/FTC against
placebo in the target population was estimated to be −3.9 HIV infections per 100 person-years (95%
CI:−9.7 to−0.7). In a sensitivity analysis, we further allowed some minor degree of cross-over by
setting CCP(X;S= HPTN 084) = 5% and 10%, and the ITT effect of TDF/FTC was estimated
to be−3.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI: −8.7 to−0.6) and −3.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI:
−7.8 to−0.5), respectively. We then conducted inference using the EIF-based estimator proposed
in Section 4.2. The ITT effect of TDF/FTC was estimated to be −3.1 per 100 person-years (95%
CI:−5.3,−0.9) assuming no cross-over. If we set CCP(X;S= HPTN 084) = 5% and 10%, the
ITT effect of TDF/FTC was estimated to be −2.5 per 100 person-years (95% CI: −4.5,−0.5) and
−1.8 per 100 person-years (95% CI: −3.6, 0.0), respectively. In this integrated analysis, we found
that the EIF-based estimators were more efficient compared to the regression-based estimators.
Because the target population and the Partners PrEP population was not well-overlapped in
baseline commodities including Gonorrhea and Chlamydia, we further considered an analysis re-
stricted to participants testing negative for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Trichomonas at baseline.
For this target population, the ITT effect of TDF/FTC against placebo was estimated to be −3.3
per 100 person-years (95% CI: −9.0 to−0.4) assuming no cross-over. According to the EIF-based
estimator, the ITT effect of TDF/FTC was estimated to be −2.2 per 100 person-years (95% CI:
−4.5 to 0 .0) assuming no cross-over.
Finally, we considered relaxing Assumption 3 in the Partners PrEP study and only partially
identifying the conditional average treatment effect of daily TDF/FTC versus placebo. To this end,
we considered the following strategy. Within each stratum defined by observed covariates X, the
conditional average treatment effect can be decomposed into a weighted sum of the treatment effect
among the subgroup of compliers and that among the non-compliers, weighted by their relatively
proportions in the stratum. It then suffices to determine the average treatment effect among the
compliers, non-compliers, and their proportions, all within the strata of observed covariates. Con-
27ditional on the observed covariates, the complier average effect is identified by the ratio estimator
(4). On the other hand, the treatment effect of daily oral TDF/FTC among non-compliers has the
following natural bounds: the maximum treatment effect was to reduce all HIV incidence in the
placebo arm of the Partners PrEP study and the minimum effect was 0. In this way, we estimated
bounds for the conditional average treatment effect and used these bounds to form the final ITT
effect estimates against placebo in the target population. Assuming no cross-over, the interval
estimates of the ITT effect were [ −3.6,−2.5] per 100 person-years (95% CI: −8.0 to−0.4).
6.4 Estimating the absolute efficacy of CAB-LA in the target population
Our analysis also immediately implies that the HIV incidence was 6 .5 (95% CI: 3.1 to 12.4) per
100 person-years in the counterfactual placebo arm (primary analysis under the point identification
assumptions and based on the regression-based estimator) in the target population. This estimate
became 5 .5 (95% CI: 1.5 to 11.0]) per 100 person-years if we further restrict the target population to
those who tested negative for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Trichomonas at baseline. These estimates
of placebo arm HIV incidence agreed reasonably well with those reported in the FEM-PrEP study
(5.0 per 100 person-years) and the VOICE study (4 .6 per 100 person-years). On the other hand,
under a na¨ ıve adoption of the constancy assumption, one would conclude an HIV incidence of 3 .7
per 100 person-year in the target population, which appeared to largely underestimating the HIV
incidence among young women in sub-Saharan Africa. Our result also implies an absolute efficacy
of CAB-LA as large as −6.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI: -11.9 to -2.6) in the target population
and−5.3 per 100 person-years (95% CI: -10.5 to -1.3) if the target population was further restricted
to those who tested negative for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia and Trichomonas at baseline. Put together
the estimates for HIV incidence in the placebo arm and the estimates of the efficacy of CAB-LA,
we estimated that CAB-LA eliminated about 95% of HIV acquisitions in the target population.
7 Discussion
In this article, we systematically study the problem of generalizing the intention-to-treat effect of
an active control versus placebo from historical placebo-controlled trials to an active-controlled
trial. Our key insight is that generalization critically depends on the post-randomization event like
adherence to the prescribed treatment in clinical trials. Our framework helps translate what FDA
28refers to as non-statistically-based uncertainties (Food and Drug Administration, 2016, Page 20)
into concrete causal identification assumptions, highlights multiple sources of heterogeneity, includ-
ing heterogeneity in participants composition, compliance, and treatment effect, and emphasizes
the role of a post-randomization event when generalizing and transporting causal conclusions.
Our work adds to existing HIV prevention literature on inferring intent-to-treat effect of an
active-control based on a “counterfactual placebo” incidence estimate, which may be constructed
via leveraging data from a concurrent registrational cohort that receives access to available standard
of care for HIV prevention (US National Library of Medicine, 2021), placebo arm data of historical
trials in a similar population (Donnell et al., 2022), HIV recency testing data collected at screening
(Gao et al., 2021) and adherence-efficacy relationship (Glidden et al., 2020, 2021).
The statistical problem of generalizing the ITT effect of an active control versus placebo from
relevant historical trials has become more relevant as active-controlled trials have become increas-
ingly prevalent. There are several ways to further this line of research. One important future
direction is to generalize the framework to more complicated settings where post-randomization
events like adherence to the intervention are time-varying, and the endpoint of interest is a time-
to-event endpoint. Second, compliance or adherence to the intervention in an instrumental variable
framework is a particular instance of a post-randomization event. It is also of interest to further
extend the framework to a more generic, post-randomization event and allow a direct effect from the
treatment to the endpoint of interest. Lastly, in many practical circumstances, researchers may not
have the luxury to work with the patient-level data across multiple phase 3 clinical trials. Study-
level adherence from historical trials has been used in a meta-regression analysis to infer oral PrEP
effectiveness (Hanscom et al., 2019). Other meta-analysis-based approaches are also available; see,
e.g., related discussion in Section 1.3. It is of interest to link the patient-level analysis proposed in
this article to the meta-analysis-based framework and articulate what identification and modeling
assumptions are needed to facilitate using only summary data from relevant historical trials.
Two statistical challenges are particularly relevant in generalizing efficacy estimates from his-
torical data. First, researchers need to always pay close attention to the overlapping covariate space
between the planned active-controlled trial and historical trials and, in our opinion, should always
focus on the well-overlapped covariate space to avoid over-extrapolation with limited data. Tradi-
tional methods like multivariate matched sampling (Rubin, 1979) can be generalized to the context
29of across-trials comparisons; see, e.g., Zhang (2023). Examining the scalar summary statistic like
Stuart et al.’s (2011) “probability of participation” is also useful. If the target trial enrolls a het-
erogeneous population of participants, then it is conceivable that multiple historical trials targeting
different different constituent parts of the target population may be needed. Second, in some cases,
it is conceivable that trials may not maintain a similar list of important covariates or may collect
different versions of the same covariates. This is less of a concern if the studies were conducted
via the same clinical trials network (e.g., the HIV Prevention Trials Network and the HIV Vaccine
Trials Network) but could lead to many practical challenges and prevent researchers from pursuing
covariate adjustment in other cases. Classical measurement error methods or methods that leverage
proxy variables could be useful.
After decomposing the target estimand into a conditional compliance term ( CC(X)) and a
conditional average treatment effect term ( CATE (X)), one relevant historical dataset is used to
derive an estimate for this conditional average treatment effect term. In some scenarios, one
may have access to multiple, patient-level historical datasets that may each inform an estimate of
CATE (X); one reasonable approach is to adopt a formal Bayesian framework as in Zhou et al.
(2019) or a random effect model to pool these CATE (X) estimates.
