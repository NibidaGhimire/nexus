Abstract
A cohesive power of a structure is an eﬀective analog of the cl assical
ultrapower of a structure. We start with a computable struct ure, and
consider its countable ultrapower over a cohesive set of nat ural numbers.
A cohesive set is an inﬁnite set of natural numbers that is ind ecompos-
able with respect to computably enumerable sets. It plays th e role of
an ultraﬁlter, and the elements of a cohesive power are the eq uivalence
classes of certain partial computable functions. Thus, unl ike many classi-
cal ultrapowers, a cohesive power is a countable structure. In this paper
we focus on cohesive powers of graphs, equivalence structur es, and com-
putable structures with a single unary function satisfying various proper-
ties, which can also be viewed as directed graphs. For these c omputable
structures, we investigate the isomorphism types of their c ohesive powers,
as well as the properties of cohesive powers when they are not isomorphic
to the original structure.

11 Introduction and Preliminaries
We consider a computability-theoretic product construction for s tructures. We
start with a uniformly computable sequence of structures for the same com-
putable language, and in their Cartesian product consider partial c omputable
sequences modulo a ﬁxed cohesive set of natural numbers. A cohe sive set is
an inﬁnite set of natural numbers, which is indecomposable with resp ect to
computably enumerable sets. In this paper we focus on eﬀective pr oducts that
are powers of a single computable structure. Some cohesive sets a re the com-
plements of maximal sets. Co-maximal powers arose naturally in the study of
the automorphisms of the lattice of computably enumerable vector spaces. In
particular, Dimitrov [8] used cohesive powers of ﬁelds to character ize principal
ﬁlters of quasimaximal vector spaces. He later introduced in [7] the notion of
a cohesive power of a computable structure in general. A cohesive p ower con-
struction produces a countable structure because the elements are represented
by partial computable functions. In some cases partial computab le functions
can be replaced by computable functions.
The motivation for cohesive powers dates back to Skolem’s constru ction of a
countable non-standard model of arithmetic (see [10]) where, inst ead of build-
ing a structure from all functions on natural numbers, he used on ly arithmetical
functions. Skolem’s idea was further developed in the study of mode ls of frag-
ments of arithmetic by Feferman, Scott and Tennenbaum [15], Lerm an [20]
Hirschfeld and Wheeler [18, 19] and McLaughlin [22, 23, 24]. In [25], Nels on
investigated recursive saturation of eﬀective ultraproducts.
Cohesive power construction allows us to obtain countable models wit h in-
teresting properties. A cohesive power of a structure Amay not be elementarily
equivalent to A. Dimitrov established a restricted version of /suppress Lo´ s’s theorem for
cohesive powers. However, additional decidability on the structur e plays a sig-
niﬁcant role in increasing satisﬁability of the same sentences in the ult rapower.
Recall the following notions from computability theory. The compleme nt of
a setX⊆ωis denoted by X. We write ⊆∗for inclusion up to ﬁnitely many
elements. By c.e. we abbreviate computably enumerable. An inﬁnite s etC⊆ω
iscohesive if for every c.e. set W, eitherW∩CorW∩Cis ﬁnite. If W∩C
is inﬁnite, then C⊆∗W,and ifW∩Cis inﬁnite, then C⊆∗W. Clearly, an
inﬁnite subset of a cohesive set is cohesive. It follows that if a cohes ive setCis
contained in the union of ﬁnitely many c.e. sets, up to ﬁnitely many elem ents,
then it is contained in one of them, up to ﬁnitely many elements. That is ,
becauseCmust have an inﬁnite intersection with at least one of the ﬁnitely
many c.e. sets in the union. It can be shown that every inﬁnite set of natural
numbers has a cohesive subset. Hence there are continuum many c ohesive sets.
Some cohesive sets are complements of c.e. sets. A set E⊆ωismaximal iﬀE
is c.e. andEis cohesive.
IfLis the language of a structure Awith domain A, thenLAis the language
Lexpanded by adding a constant symbol for every a∈A, andAA= (A,a)a∈A
is the corresponding expansion of AtoLA. Theatomic diagram ofAis the set
of all atomic and negations of atomic sentences of LAtrue inAA. A countable
2structure for a computable language Liscomputable if its domain is computable
and its atomic diagram is computable or, equivalently, its functions an d relations
are uniformly computable. The elementary diagram (or complete diagram) of
A, denoted by Dc(A), is the set of all ﬁrst-order sentences of LAthat are true in
AA. A Σ0
ndiagram ofAis the set of all Σ0
nsentences in Dc(A). A structure is
decidable if its doman is computable and its elementary diagram is computable.
A structure is n-decidable if its doman is computable and its Σ0
ndiagram is
computable. In particular, computable structures are the same a s 0-decidable
structures.
We will now give a deﬁnition of a cohesive product of computable struc tures
which appears in [9]. By ≃to denote the equality of partial functions.
Deﬁnition 1 LetLbe a computable language. Let (Ai)i∈ωbe a uniformly
computable sequence of computable structures in L, with uniformly computable
sequence of domains (Ai)i∈ω. LetC⊆ωbe a cohesive set. The cohesive
product BofAioverC, in symbols B=/producttext
CAi, is a structure deﬁned as
follows.
1. Let

i∈ωAiis a partial computable function ∧C⊆∗dom(ψ)}.
Forψ1,ψ2∈D, let
ψ1=Cψ2iﬀC⊆∗{i:ψ1(i)↓=ψ2(i)↓}.
The domain of/producttext

such that for every [ψ1],..., [ψn]∈B, we have
fB([ψ1],..., [ψn]) = [ψ]iﬀ (∀i∈ω)/bracketleftbig

.
3. IfR∈Lis anm-ary relation symbol, then RBis anm-ary relation on B
such that for every [ψ1],..., [ψm]∈B,
RB([ψ1],..., [ψm])iﬀC⊆∗{i∈ω|RAi(ψ1(i),...,ψ m(i))}.

casuch thatca(i) =afor everyi∈ω. The function d:A→Bsuch that
d(a) = [ca] is called the canonical embedding ofAintoB.
In [9, 13] we provide variants of /suppress Lo´ s’s theorem for cohesive prod ucts of
uniformly computable and more generally uniformly n-decidable structures. For
example, every Σ0
n+3sentence true in an n-decidable structure is also true in
its cohesive powers. In particular, we have the following theorem fo r cohesive
powers of computable structures.
Theorem 2 (Dimitrov [7]) Let B=/producttext

structure A.LetCbe a cohesive set.

2. Ifσis aΠ0
3sentence in L, thenB |=σimpliesA |=σ.
By contrapositive, if σis aΣ0
3sentence in L, thenA |=σimpliesB |=σ
The converse of part (2) in the previous theorem does not hold. Th e ﬁrst
such counterexample was produced by Feferman, Scott and Tenn enbaum in
their result in [15] that no cohesive power of the standard model of arithmetic
is a model of Peano arithmetic. There is a Π0
3sentence involving Kleene’s
Tpredicate that is true in the standard model of arithmetic Nbut is false in
every cohesive power of N(see [20]). More recently, in [13], we produced natural
examples of such sentences concerning linear orders.
In [7], Dimitrov established that if Ais a decidable structure, then Aand/producttext
CAsatisfy the same ﬁrst-order sentences, i.e., they are elementarily equiva-
lent. A corresponding result has been formulated for n-decidable structures in
[14].
An equivalence structure A= (A,EA) consists of a set Awith a binary re-
lationEAthat is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive. An equivalence struct ure
Aiscomputable ifAis a computable set and EAis a computable relation. An
application of Theorem 2 is that if Ais a computable equivalence structure,
then so is/producttext
CA. That is because the theory of equivalence structures is Π0
1-
axiomatizable. Similarly, a cohesive power of a computable ﬁeld is a ﬁeld. In
[12], we investigated cohesive powers of the ﬁeld Qof rational numbers over
4co-maximal sets. For example, we proved that two cohesive power s ofQover
co-maximal sets are isomorphic iﬀ the maximal sets have the same m-degree.
Dimitrov [7] showed that if Ais a ﬁnite structure, then/producttext
CA∼=A. Also,
ifAandBare computably isomorphic structures and Cis a cohesive set, then
ΠCA∼=ΠCB(for a proof see [13]). A computable structure Ais called com-
putably categorical if every computable isomorphic structure is computably iso-
morphic to A.
A computable (inﬁnitary) language is more expressive than the usua l ﬁni-
tary ﬁrst-order language. For a computable ordinal α, Ash deﬁned computable
Σαand Π αformulas of Lω1ωrecursively and simultaneously and together with
their G¨ odel numbers. For the natural numbers we roughly have t he following
classiﬁcation of formulas. Computable Σ 0and Π 0formulas are just the ﬁnitary
quantiﬁer-free formulas. For n > 1, acomputable Πnformula is a c.e. con-
junction of formulas ∀uφ(x,u), whereφis a computable Σ mformula for some
m < n . Dually, a computable Σnformula is a c.e. disjunction of formulas
∃vθ(y,v), whereθis a computable Π mformula for some m<n . (See [16].) For
more on computability theory see [26]. By /an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔we denote a computable bijec-
tion fromω2ontoω,which is strictly increasing with respect to each coordinate
and such that k,n≤ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔.
This paper is a greatly expanded version of the preliminary work in [17]
to appear in the proceedings following the Fall Western Sectional Me eting of
the AMS during October 23–24, 2021. There, we studied cohesive p owers of
certain graphs and equivalence structures. For example, we show ed that every
computable graph can be embedded into a cohesive power of a stron gly locally
ﬁnite graph. Here, we also investigate cohesive powers of computa ble struc-
tures with a single unary function satisfying various properties, ca lled injection
structures, two-to-one structures, and (2,0)-to-one struc tures. We further study
cohesive powers of partial injection structures viewed as relation al structures.
We characterize the isomorphism types of cohesive powers of thes e computable
structures, and use computable (inﬁnitary) language to describe the properties
of cohesive powers when they are not isomorphic to the original str ucture.
2 Cohesive powers of graphs
Agraph (or undirected graph) ( V,E) is a nonempty set Vof vertices with
a symmetric binary relation E(also called the edge relation), so it can be
axiomatized by the following universal sentence:
∀x∀y[E(x,y)⇒E(y,x)].
Hence, by Theorem 2 a cohesive power of a graph is a graph.
If (x,y)∈E,then vertices xandyare adjacent to each other. The degree of
a vertex is the number of vertices it is adjacent to. A graph Gis called locally
ﬁnite if the degree of each vertex in Gis ﬁnite. A graph Gisstrongly locally
ﬁnite if all connected components of Gare ﬁnite. In [5], a criterion was obtained
for computable categoricity of certain strongly locally ﬁnite comput able graphs.
5Thedisjoint union of graphs (V1,E1) and (V2,E2) whereV1∩V2=∅is a
graph (V1∪V2,E1∪E2). Hence there are no edges between V1andV2. We write
(V1,E1)∐(V2,E2) and also view it as decomposition into a disjoint union. If
V1∩V2=∅,then a union of graphs G1= (V1,E1) andG2= (V2,E2) is any
graphG= (V1∪V2,E) such that E1∪E2⊆EandE↾(Vi×Vi) =Eifor
i= 1,2. We simply write G=G1∪G2.
The following result demonstrates the universal feature with resp ect to em-
beddability into cohesive powers of certain computable graphs.
Theorem 3 LetGbe a computable graph. Let Cbe a cohesive set. Then there
is a computable, strongly locally ﬁnite graph Asuch that ΠCAis isomorphic to
the unionG∪Hfor some graph HorH=∅.
Proof. IfGis ﬁnite, then Gis strongly locally ﬁnite and G∼=ΠCG.
LetN+=ω−{0}.Now, assume that a graph G= (V,R) is inﬁnite and ﬁx
a computable enumeration fof its vertices V={f(n) :n∈N+}.Using this
enumeration we will build a computable graph Awith domain N+and edge set
E. Consider vertices a,b∈N+.Ifa,bcan be written as a=k(k+1)
2+mand
b=k(k+1)
2+nfor somek,m,n such that 1 ≤m,n≤k+ 1,then let
(a,b)∈E⇔(f(m),f(n))∈R.
If there are no k,m,n as above, then let ( a,b)/∈E. Note thatk(k+1)
2= 1 +
2 +···+k, so the idea is to divide the natural numbers into segments of length
1,2,.... Clearly, Ais a computable, strongly locally ﬁnite graph.
Forn∈N+we deﬁne functions ψnbyψn(x) =x(x+1)
2+n. Hence each [ ψn]
is an element of the cohesive power Π CA.Consider the subgraph SofAwith
the vertex set {[ψn] :n∈N+}. Consider a function ρ:{[ψn] :n∈N+} →V
deﬁned by ρ([ψn]) =f(n). Then we can show that ρis a graph isomorphism
(see [17]), so Sis isomorphic to G.Hence Π CAis isomorphic to the union G∪H
for some graph H.
If a computable graph Gis locally ﬁnite, we have a stronger result.
Theorem 4 LetGbe an inﬁnite computable graph that is locally ﬁnite. Let C
be a cohesive set. Then there is a computable, strongly local ly ﬁnite graph A
such that ΠCAis isomorphic to the disjoint union G⊔Hfor some graph H.
Proof. LetG= (V,R). Letf,A,ψn,ρbe deﬁned as in the proof of the previous
theorem. Let ϕbe a partial computable function such that [ ϕ]∈ΠCAand
E([ϕ],[ψm]) for some m≥1.ThenC⊆∗{i∈ω:ϕ(i)↓ ∧(ϕ(i),ψm(i))∈E}.
SinceGis locally ﬁnite, we have that {i∈ω:ϕ(i)↓ ∧(ϕ(i),ψm(i))∈E}is the
following ﬁnite disjoint union of c.e. sets:
/coproducttext
n:f(m)Rf(n){i∈ω:ϕ(i) =i(i+1)
2+nwhere 1≤m,n≤i+ 1}.
SinceCis cohesive, there is some n0such that
C⊆∗{i:ϕ(i)↓=i(i+1)
2+n0} ⊆ {i:ϕ(i)↓=ψn0(i)}.
6Hence [ϕ] = [ψn0].Thus, Π CAis isomorphic to the disjoint union G⊔(ΠCA−
{[ψm] :m≥1}).
3 Cohesive powers of equivalence relations
LetA= (A,EA) be an equivalence structure A. The equivalence class of a∈A
is
eqvA(a) ={x∈A:xEAa}.
We generally omit the superscript when it can be inferred from the co ntext.
Deﬁnition 5 (i)LetAbe an equivalence relation. The character of Ais the
set
χ(A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:n,k> 0andAhas at least nequivalence classes of size k}.
(ii)We say that Ahasbounded character if there is some ﬁnite ksuch that
all ﬁnite equivalence classes of Ahave size at most k.
Clearly, two countable equivalence structures are isomorphic if the y have the
same character and the same number of inﬁnite equivalence classes .
For a setX, bycard(X) or|X|we denote the size of X.Let
InfA={a:eqvA(a) is inﬁnite }andFinA={a:eqvA(a) is ﬁnite }.
The following lemma from [2] gives us some important complexities.
Lemma 6 For any computable equivalence structure A:
(a){/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,a/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:card(eqvA(a))≤k}is aΠ0
1set, and {/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,a/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:card(eqvA(a))≥k
is aΣ0
1set;
(b)InfAis aΠ0
2set, andFinAis aΣ0
2set;
(c)χ(A)is aΣ0
2set.
We say that a subset Kofωis acharacter if there is some equivalence
structure with character K. This is the same as saying that K⊆ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔ω−{0}/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔×
/an}bracke⊔le{⊔ω−0}/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔, for alln>0 andk,
/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n+ 1/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈K⇒ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈K.
It was shown in [2] that for any Σ0
2characterK, there is a computable
equivalence structure Awith character K, which has inﬁnitely many inﬁnite
equivalence classes while FinAis a Π0
1set.
Theorem 7 [2] LetAbe a computable equivalence structure. The structure A
is computably categorical iﬀ it is one of the following types :
71.Ahas only ﬁnitely many ﬁnite equivalence classes;
2.Ahas ﬁnitely many inﬁnite classes, bounded character, and at most one
ﬁniteksuch that there are inﬁnitely many classes of size k.
Hence if Ais an equivalence structure as in the previous theorem and Dis
a computable structure isomorphic to A,then for any cohesive set Cwe have
ΠCA∼=ΠCD.
Proposition 8 LetAbe a computable equivalence structure. Let Cbe a cohe-
sive set and let B= ΠCA.
(a) Thenχ(B) =χ(A).
(b) IfAhas inﬁnitely many inﬁnite equivalence classes, then Bhas inﬁnitely
many inﬁnite equivalence classes.
IfAhas exactly ninﬁnite equivalence classes, then Bhas at least ninﬁnite
equivalence classes.
(c) IfAhas inﬁnitely many inﬁnite equivalence classes, then ΠCA∼=A.
(d) IfAhas ﬁnitely many ﬁnite equivalence classes and no inﬁnite eq uiva-
lence classes, then ΠCA∼=A.
Proof. (a) The character of an equivalence structure is deﬁnable by a Σ0
2
sentence (see [2]).
(b) This holds since there is an embedding of AintoB.
(c) This follows from (a) and (b). That is, if Ahas inﬁnitely many inﬁ-
nite equivalence classes, then Π CAalso has inﬁnitely many inﬁnite equivalence
classes, and since Aand Π CAhave the same character, they are isomorphic.
(d) This is true since Ais a ﬁnite structure.
Theorem 9 LetA= (A,E)be a computable equivalence structure. Let Cbe
a cohesive set. If Ahas a bounded character, then ΠCA∼=A.
Proof. Since the character of Ais bounded, if it is nonempty, let k∈ωbe the
largest size of a ﬁnite equivalence class of A. If the character of Ais empty, let
k= 0. Recall that Aand ΠCAhave the same character. If Ahas inﬁnitely many
inﬁnite equivalence classes, then Aand ΠCAare isomorphic. Thus, assume that
Ahas at most ﬁnitely many inﬁnite equivalence classes.
IfAhas no inﬁnite equivalence class, then Asatisﬁes the following Π0
1sen-
tence, saying that there are no k+ 1 non-equivalent elements:
(∀x1)···(∀xk+1)[/logicalortext
1≤i<j≤k+1xiExj]
8Since Π CAsatisﬁes the same sentence, it has no inﬁnite equivalence classes, s o
Aand Π CAare isomorphic.
Thus, assume that Ahasminﬁnite equivalence classes, where m∈ωand
m> 0. Hence Asatisﬁes the following Σ0
2sentence, saying that there are exactly
mequivalence classes with at least k+ 1 elements, hence inﬁnite. We will use
notationxl
ifor variables.
(∃x1

1)]
Hence Π CAsatisﬁes the same sentence, so it has exactly minﬁnite equivalence
classes, so it is isomorphic to A.
Theorem 10 LetA= (A,E)be a computable equivalence structure. Let Cbe
a cohesive set. If Ahas an unbounded character, then ΠCAhas inﬁnitely many
inﬁnite equivalence classes.
Hence if Ahas an unbounded character and ﬁnitely many (possibly zero)
inﬁnite equivalence classes, then ΠCA≇A.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we will assume that A=ω.Hence we can
order the elements in Aby the usual ordering of the natural numbers. Let
B= ΠCA,andB= (B,EB). Choose a computable sequence of elements in A:
a(0),a(1),a(2),a(3),...
such that they all belong to distinct equivalence classes, and for ev eryk,the
equivalence class of a(k) has> k elements. Since Eis computable and the
character of Ais unbounded, such a sequence can be obtained by enumerating A
and checking the conditions. We can think of a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) as a representative of the
equivalence class in Awhere a partial function ψm,∗might take its ithcoordinate
value (fori≥0). That is, deﬁne partial computable functions ψm,n(i), for
m,i≥0 andn≥1,as follows:
ψm,n(i) =/braceleftbigg
cncnis thenthelement ineqv(a/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) if it exists;
↑ otherwise.
Everyψm,nis deﬁned for all except possibly ﬁnitely many initial values, so
C⊆∗dom(ψm,n). Hence [ψm,n]∈B.
Fixm.Letn1/ne}a⊔ionslash=n2. Then we have that [ ψm,n1]/ne}a⊔ionslash= [ψm,n2] since|eqv(a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)|>
/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ≥i, so starting with some i, eqv (a/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) will have the nth
1and thenth
2
elements and they will be distinct. Also, [ ψm,n1]EB[ψm,n2] since the values of
ψm,n1andψm,n2, when deﬁned, are from the same equivalence class in A. Hence
the equivalence class of [ ψm,1] is inﬁnite.
Now, letm1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2.Then¬([ψm1,1]EB[ψm2,1]) since the values of ψm1,1and
ψm2,1, when deﬁned, are from diﬀerent equivalence classes in A.
9Corollary 11 LetA= (A,E)be a computable equivalence structure. Let C
be a cohesive set. Then ΠCA∼=AiﬀAhas a bounded character or inﬁnitely
many equivalence classes.
It was shown in [1] that the following model-theoretic result holds for the
equivalence structures. Let the formulas γk(x) state that the equivalence class of
xhas at least kelements, where k∈ω−{0}. Then the language of equivalence
relations {E}expanded with unary predicates {γk:k≥1}has quantiﬁer
elimination; i.e., every ﬁrst-order formula in the original language is log ically
equivalent to a quantiﬁer-free formula in the new language. Since th e formulas
γk(x) are Σ0
1formulas, it follows that a computable equivalence structure A
and its cohesive powers satisfy the same ﬁrst-order sentences. However, in some
cases, the distinction can be made by using computable (inﬁnitary) s entences.
Corollary 12 LetA= (A,E)be a computable equivalence structure with un-
bounded character and no inﬁnite equivalence classes. Let Cbe a cohesive set.
Then there is a computable inﬁnitary Σ3sentenceαsuch that ΠCA |=αand
A |=¬α.
Proof. We have that Π CAhas an inﬁnite equivalence class, while Adoes not.
Letαbe the sentence saying that there is an inﬁnite equivalence class:
∃x/logicalandtext
n∈ω[∃y1···∃yn/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤n(yi/ne}a⊔ionslash=yj∧xEyi)].
Henceαis a computable Σ 3sentence true in Π CAbut false in A.
4 Injection structures
We will now study structures with a single unary function. An injection struc-
tureA= (A,f) consists of a non-empty set Awith an one-to-one function
f:A→A. Letf0(a) =defa. Givena∈A, theorbit ofaunderfis deﬁned as
Of(a) ={b∈A: (∃n∈ω)[fn(a) =b∨fn(b) =a]}.
We have that the size of orbit Of(a) isk≥1 if and only if fk(a) =aand
(∀t<k )[ft(a)/ne}a⊔ionslash=a]. Hence the property that card(Of(a)) =kis computable.
By analogy with the character of an equivalence structure, we deﬁ ne the
characterχ(A) of an injection structure Aas follows:
χ(A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔ω−{0}/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔×/an}bracke⊔le{⊔ω−{0}/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:Ahas at least norbits of size k}.
Hence/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χ(A) if and only if
(∃x1)···(∃xn)/parenleftBig/logicalandtextn
i=1card(Of(xi)) =k∧/logicalandtext
i/negationslash=j(∀t<k )[ft(xi)/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj]/parenrightBig
.
Byran(f) we denote the range of f,ran(f) =f(A). An injection structure
(A,f) may have two types of inﬁnite orbits: Z-orbits, which are isomorphic
10to (Z,S) and in which every element is in ran(f), andω-orbits, which are
isomorphic to ( ω,S) and have the form Of(a) ={fn(a) :n∈ω}for some
a /∈ran(f). Thus, injection structures are characterized by the number o f
orbits of size kfor each ﬁnite k, and by the number of orbits of types Zand of
typeω.
For every computable injection structure A= (A,f), we have the following
arithmetic complexity of important relations:
(a){(k,a) :a∈ran(fk)}is a Σ0
1set,
(b){(a,k) :card(Of(a))≥k}is a Σ0
1set,
(c){a:Of(a) is inﬁnite }is a Π0
1set,
(d){a:Of(a) has typeZ}is a Π0
2set,
(e){a:Of(a)has typeω}is a Σ0
2set, and
(f)χ(A) is a Σ0
1set.
It was shown in [3] that for any c.e. character K, there is a computable
injection structure A= (ω,f) with character Kand any speciﬁed ﬁnite or
countably inﬁnite number of orbits of types ωandZand for which ran(f) is
computable and {a:Of(a) is ﬁnite }is computable.
Theorem 13 [3] A computable injection structure Ais computably categorical
if and only if Ahas ﬁnitely many inﬁnite orbits.
Hence if Ais an injection structure with ﬁnitely many inﬁnite orbits and D
is a computable structure isomorphic to A,then for any cohesive set Cwe have
ΠCA∼=ΠCD.
Byf−1(b) we will denote the unique asuch thatf(a) =bif it exists, in
symbolsf−1(b)↓=a; otherwise f−1(b) is not deﬁned which we also denote by
f−1(b)↑. Forn≥1,we denote by f−na partial function ( f−1)n.
Since the injection structures have the following axiom
∀x∀y[f(x) =f(y)⇒x=y],
we have that a cohesive power of a computable injection structure is an injection
structure. We would like to determine the isomorphism types of such cohesive
powers.
Proposition 14 LetA= (A,f)be a computable injection structure. Let Cbe
a cohesive set, and B= ΠCA.
(a) Thenχ(B) =χ(A).
(b) The structures AandBhave the same number of ω-orbits.
(c) IfAhas bounded character and no inﬁnite orbits, then A∼=B.
11Proof. (a) The character of a computable injection structure is deﬁnable by a
Σ0
1sentence.
(b) Letn∈ω−{0}.We can say that there are ≥nmanyω-orbits by the
following Σ0
2sentenceσn:
(∃x1)···(∃xn)(∀y)[/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj∧/logicalandtext
1≤i≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=f(y)].
Thus, having < n manyω-orbits can be expressed by a Π0
2sentence, ¬σn.
Hence if Ahas noω-orbits,Bhas noω-orbits; and if Ahas exactly nmany
ω-orbits,Bhas exactly nmanyω-orbits. If Ahas inﬁnitely many ω-orbits, then
for everyn≥1,A/satisfiesσnand hence B/satisfiesσn, soBhas inﬁnitely many ω-orbits.
The last conclusion also follows from the fact that Acan be embedded into B.
(c) Since the character of Ais bounded, let k∈ω−{0}be the largest size
of a ﬁnite orbit of A.
SinceAhas no inﬁnite orbits, Asatisﬁes the following Π0
1sentence, saying
that there are no orbits of size k+ 1:
¬(∃x)[/logicalandtext
1≤i≤k+1fi(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=x]
Thus,Bsatisﬁes the same sentence and, since Bhas the same character as A,
it is isomorphic to A.
Theorem 15 LetAbe a computable injection structure with unbounded char-
acter. Let Cbe a cohesive set, and B= ΠCA.ThenBhas inﬁnitely many
Z-orbits.
Hence if Ahas unbounded character and ﬁnitely many Z-orbits, then A≇
ΠCA.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we will assume that A=ω.Choose a
computable sequence of elements in A:
a(0),a(1),a(2),a(3),...
such that they all belong to distinct ﬁnite orbits, and for every k,the orbit
ofa(k) has> k elements. Since fis computable and the character of Ais
unbounded, such a sequence can be obtained by simultaneously enu merating
the elements of Aand checking the conditions.
For every natural number mand an integer z∈Z,we will deﬁne a com-
putable function ψm,zas follows:
ψm,z(i) =fz(a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)).
Each [ψm,z] is inB.Fixm. Let integers z1,z2be such that z1/ne}a⊔ionslash=z2. Starting
with somei0,the orbit of a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) will be so large that for i≥i0, we will have
fz1(a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔))/ne}a⊔ionslash=fz2(a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)),
hence [ψm,z1]/ne}a⊔ionslash= [ψm,z2]. In addition, [ ψm,z1] and [ψm,z2] belong to the same
orbit inBsincefz2−z1([ψm,z1]) = [ψm,z2]. Hence the set {[ψm,z] :z∈Z}forms
12aZ-orbit. On the other hand, if m1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2,then for every i,/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m1,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ /ne}a⊔ionslash=/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m2,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔, so
a(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m1,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) anda(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m2,i/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔) belong to diﬀerent orbits. Hence [ ψm1,0] and [ψm2,0]
belong to diﬀerent orbits in B,so there are inﬁnitely many Z-orbits.
Theorem 16 LetAbe a computable injection structure with an inﬁnite orbit.
LetCbe a cohesive set, and B= ΠCA.ThenBhas inﬁnitely many Z-orbits.
Hence if Ahas an inﬁnite orbit, but has at most ﬁnitely many Z-orbits, then
A≇ΠCA.
Proof. Assume that Ahas an inﬁnite orbit. Let abe an element of such an
inﬁnite orbit. For every natural number mand every integer z, we deﬁne a
partial computable function ψm,zbyψm.z(n) =fm(2n+1)+n−1+z(a). Since the
domain of each ψis co-ﬁnite, we have that [ ψm,z]∈B. For anymandz1,z2such
thatz1/ne}a⊔ionslash=z2,we have that {n:ψm,z1(n)↓=ψm,z2(n)↓}=∅since the orbit of
ais inﬁnite; hence [ ψm,z1]/ne}a⊔ionslash= [ψm,z2]. We also have that f([ψm,z]) = [f◦ψm,z] =
[ψm,z+1]. Hence for every mwe have aZ-orbit{[ψm,z] :z∈Z}=O([ψm,0]).
Now, assume that m1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2. Since for any k∈ω, we havefk([ψm1,0])/ne}a⊔ionslash=
[ψm2,0], it follows that O([ψm1,0])/ne}a⊔ionslash=O([ψm2,0]). Hence Bhas inﬁnitely many
Z-orbits.
Corollary 17 LetA= (A,f)be a computable injection structure. Let Cbe
a cohesive set. Then ΠCA∼=AiﬀAhas a bounded character and no inﬁnite
orbits, or Ahas inﬁnitely many Z-orbits.
It was shown in [3] that the following model-theoretic result holds for the
injection structures. Let the formulas γk(x) state that ( ∃y)[fk(y) =x]. Then
in the language of injection structures {f}expanded with unary predicates
{γk:k≥1}we have quantiﬁer elimination; i.e., every ﬁrst-order formula in
the original language is logically equivalent to a quantiﬁer-free formu la in the
new language. Since the formulas γk(x) are Σ0
1formulas, it follows that a
computable injection structure Aand its cohesive powers satisfy the same ﬁrst-
order sentences. However, in some cases, the distinction can be m ade by using
computable (inﬁnitary) sentences.
Corollary 18 IfAis a computable injection structure with an unbounded char-
acter and no inﬁnite orbits, then there is a computable (inﬁn itary) Σ2sentence
αsuch that B/satisfiesαandA/notsatisfiesα.
Proof. Letαsay that there is an inﬁnite orbit:
∃x/logicalandtext
k∈ω[f(k)(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=x].
5 Two-to-one structure
We will now investigate cohesive powers of two-to-one structures that were in-
troduced and studied in [4] from the computability-theoretic point o f view with
focus on the complexity of isomorphisms between these structure s.
13Deﬁnition 19 Atwo-to-one structure A= (A,f)consists of a non-empty do-
mainAwith a single unary function f:A→Asuch that for every a∈Awe
havecard(f−1(a)) = 2.
We will also call a two-to-one structure a 2:1 structure, and often identify it
with its directed graph GAwith vertex set Aand edges ( a,f(a)) fora∈A.
Deﬁnition 20 Fora∈A,the orbit of ais:
Of(a) ={x∈A: (∃n,m∈ω) [fn(x) =fm(a)]}.
That is, the orbit of ais the set of elements of A, which belong to the same
connected component of GAto whichabelongs.
LetBbe a full binary tree with its nodes pointing toward the root. We
can show that there are two types of orbits in a 2:1 structure: Z-chains, and
k-cycles fork≥1. AZ-chain consists of a directed one-to-one basic sequence
of nodes ordered as integers, with a tree Battached to every node of the basic
sequence as follows: there is a connecting edge, which is not part of the basic
sequence but points toward the sequence, to which the root of Bis attached. A
k-cycle is a directed one-to-one cycle of size ksuch that a tree Bis attached to
each node of the cycle via a connecting edge, which is not part of the cycle but
points toward the cycle, to which the root of Bis attached. Hence all tree edges
point toward the cycle. For pictures illustrating orbits see Section 1 in [4].
Lemma 21 [4] (i) The predicate “ Of(a)is ak-cycle” is Σ0
1.
(ii) The predicate “ Of(a)is aZ-chain” is Π0
1.
Two countable 2:1 structures are isomorphic if they have the same n umber
ofk-cycles for every k≥1, and the same number of Z-chains.
2:1 structures have the following axioms:
∀y∃x1∃x2[x1/ne}a⊔ionslash=x2∧f(x1) =y∧f(x2)⇒y]
∀x1∀x2∀x3[(f(x1) =f(x2)∧f(x2) =f(x3))⇒(x1=x2∨x1=x3∨x2=x3)]
Hence a cohesive power of a computable 2:1 structure is a 2:1 struct ure. We
would like to determine the isomorphism types of these cohesive powe rs.
Theorem 22 LetAbe a computable 2 : 1structure. Let Cbe a cohesive set,
andB= ΠCA.
(i) The cohesive power Bhas the same number of k-cycles, for any k≥1,
asAdoes.
(ii) The cohesive power Bhas inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
Hence if Ahas at most ﬁnitely many Z-chains, then A≇ΠCA.
14Proof. (i) The property that a 2:1 structure has at least nmanyk-cycles,
wheren,k≥1 can be expressed by an existential sentence θn,k:
(∃x1)···(∃xn)[/logicalandtext
1≤m≤n(fk(xm) =xm∧(/logicalandtext
1≤l<kfl(xm)/ne}a⊔ionslash=xm))
∧/logicalandtext
(1≤i<j≤n)&(1≤l<k)fl(xi)/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj].
Hence both Aand its cohesive power Bsatisfy the same such sentences, so they
have the same number of k-cycles.
(ii) Fix a natural ordering on the domain A.We will “abuse” the notation
and byf−1denote the unary function on A,which for every achooses the
smaller of the two elements that fmaps intoa. Hencef−zwill be deﬁned for
every integer zwhere, as usual, f0(a) =a.
SinceAalways contains a full binary tree component T, we can deﬁne a
computable function g:ω→A,which chooses elements g(n) onTthat are
spaced apart so that fz(g(n)) where |z| ≤ndo not “interfere” for diﬀerent
n’s. More precisely, if n1/ne}a⊔ionslash=n2orz1/ne}a⊔ionslash=z2,thenfz1(g(n1))/ne}a⊔ionslash=fz2(g(n2)) where
|z1| ≤n1and|z2| ≤n2. Equivalently,
|fz(g(n)) :−n≤z≤n∧0≤n≤m}|= (m+ 1)2.
Our goal is to use this property to deﬁne partial computable funct ionsψm,z
for natural numbers mand integers z, such that ψm,∗’s witness that there are
inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
A partial function ψm,z:ω→Ais deﬁned as follows:
ψm,z(x) =/braceleftbigg
fz(g(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,x/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)) if|z| ≤ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,x/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔;
↑ otherwise.
It follows that [ ψm,z]∈Bfor everym,z. Furthermore, f([ψm,z]) = [ψm,z+1], so
{[ψm,z] :z∈Z}is a subset of a Z-chain. For any pair of natural numbers m1and
m2such thatm1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2and arbitrary k1,k2, we havefk1([ψm1,0])/ne}a⊔ionslash=fk2([ψm2,0]),
so [ψm1,0] and [ψm2,0] belong to diﬀerent Z-chains. Hence Bhas inﬁnitely many
Z-chains.
Corollary 23 LetAbe a computable 2 : 1structure. Let Cbe a cohesive set.
ThenA∼=ΠCAiﬀAhas inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
Corollary 24 LetAbe a computable 2 : 1structure with no Z-chains. Let C
be a cohesive set, and B=/producttext
CA. Then there is a computable (inﬁnitary) Σ2
sentenceαsuch that B/satisfiesαandA/notsatisfiesα.
Proof. Letαsay that there is a Z-chain:
∃x/logicalandtext
l≥0&k>0(f(l+k)(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=fl(x)).
156 (2,0):1 structures
We will now investigate the class of (2,0):1 structures, which includes 2:1 struc-
tures. They were introduced and studied in [4] from the computabilit y-theoretic
point of view with focus on the complexity of isomorphisms between th ese struc-
tures.
Deﬁnition 25 A(2,0) : 1 structure is a structure with a single unary function,
A= (A,f)wheref:A→A, such that for every a∈A, we havecard(f−1(a))∈
{0,2}.
As usual, a (2,0):1 structure Ais often identiﬁed with its directed graph
G(A,f), and the orbit of ais deﬁned to be the set of all points in Awhich
belong to the connected component of G(A,f) containing a. The orbits of
(2,0):1 structures can be k-cycles fork≥1, Z-chains, or ω-chains. A k-cycle
consists of a directed one-to-one cycle of size ksuch that for each node of the
cycle there is a connecting edge, which is not part of the cycle and po inting
toward the cycle, to which the root of a binary tree is attached with all tree
edges pointing toward the cycle. Here, a tree can be ﬁnite or inﬁnite and it has
to satisfy the condition card(f−1(a))∈ {0,2}.
AZ-chain consists of a directed one-to-one basic sequence of nodes ordered
as integers, with a binary tree attached to every node of the basic sequence as
follows: there is a connecting edge, which is not part of the basic seq uence but
points toward the sequence, to which the root of a tree is attache d. Hence each
element of a k-cycle or a Z-chain also has a binary branching tree attached to
it as its root and with all edges directed toward the root. An ω-chain consists
of a directed basic sequence of nodes ordered as natural number s such that for
every node except the ﬁrst one there is a binary branching tree at tached as
above, with connecting edge pointing toward the basic sequence an d the tree
edges pointing toward the root. Hence the ﬁrst node of the basic s equence does
not belong to the range of f. For pictures illustrating orbits see Section 1 in [4].
Let (A,f) be a (2,0):1 structure and a∈A. Thelength ofais deﬁned as:
l(a) = sup{n+ 1 :/vextendsingle/vextendsingle{a,f(a),f2(a),...,fn+1(a)}/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=n+ 1}.
It is the longest “non-cycling” directed path starting with a.It can be ﬁnite or
inﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 26 LetA= (A,f)be a (2,0) : 1structure. Let k,n∈ω−{0}.
(a) The cycle character ofAis
χcycle(A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:Ahas/greaterorequalslantnmanyk-cycles}.
(b) The path character ofAis
16χpath(A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:Ahas/greaterorequalslantnmanyasuch thatl(a) =k}.
(c) The endpath character ofAis
χendpath (A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:Ahas/greaterorequalslantnmanya /∈f(A)such thatl(a) =k}.
We say that a character is bounded if there is an upper bound on k.
(2,0):1 structures have the following axioms:
∀y∀x∃z[f(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=y∨(z/ne}a⊔ionslash=x∧f(z) =y)] and
∀x1∀x2∀x3[(f(x1) =f(x2)∧f(x2) =f(x3))⇒(x1=x2∨x1=x3∨x2=
x3)].
Hence a cohesive power of a computable (2,0):1 structure is a (2,0):1 structure.
Proposition 27 LetAbe a computable (2,0) : 1structure. Let Cbe a cohesive
set, and let B=/producttext
CA. ThenAandBhave tha same cycle character, path
character, and endpath character.
Proof. Letk,n≥1. Then/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χcycle(A) can be expressed by a Σ0
1sentence
as in the proof of Theorem 22 (i).
Furthermore, /an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χpath(A) can be expressed by the following Σ0
1sen-
tence:
(∃x1)···(∃xn)[/logicalandtext
1≤m≤n((/logicalandtext
0≤l<s<kfl(xm)/ne}a⊔ionslash=fs(xm))∧
/logicalortext
1≤l<k(fk(xm) =fl(xm)))∧/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj].
Finally,/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χendpath (A) can be expressed by the following Σ0
2sentence:
(∃x1)···(∃xn)[/logicalandtext
1≤m≤n((/logicalandtext
0≤l<s<kfl(xm)/ne}a⊔ionslash=fs(xm))∧
/logicalortext
1≤l<k(fk(xm) =fl(xm))∧(∀y)(f(xm)/ne}a⊔ionslash=y))∧/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj].
By Theorem 2 it follows that AandBsatisfy the same sentences above for
every pair ( k,n),soAandBhave the same characters.
Theorem 28 LetCbe a cohesive set.
(i) LetAbe a computable (2,0) : 1structure with bounded path character
and no inﬁnite orbits. Then ΠCA∼=A.
(ii) LetAbe a computable (2,0) : 1structure with unbounded path character
or with an inﬁnite orbit. Then ΠCAhas inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
Hence if Ahas only ﬁnitely many (including zero) Z-chains, we have A≇
ΠCA.
17Proof. (i) LetB= ΠCA. LetM∈ωbe the least upper bound for the length
of (ﬁnite) paths in A. Since Adoes not have inﬁnite orbits, it satisﬁes the
following Π0
1sentence:
(∀x)/logicalortext
0≤m<n≤M(fm(x) =fn(x)).
By Theorem 2, Balso satisﬁes this sentence, which implies that Bhas no inﬁnite
orbits. Since we can completely describe ﬁnite orbits by Σ0
2sentences, it follows
thatAandBare isomorphic.
(ii) Fix a natural ordering on the domain A.We will denote by f−1a partially
computable unary function on A,which for every achooses the smaller of the two
elements that fmaps intoa,ifcard(f−1(a)) = 2, and is undeﬁned otherwise.
Hence we have f−zfor every integer z, wheref0(a) =a.
By the assumption about A,we can deﬁne a computable function g:ω→
A,which chooses elements g(n) inAsuch that for every m∈ω,we have
|{fz(g(n)) :fz(g(n))↓ ∧0≤n≤m∧−n≤z≤m}|= (m+ 1)2. We now pro-
ceed similarly as in (ii) in the proof of Theorem 22 to show that there ar e
inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
The following theorem focuses on ω-chains.
Theorem 29 LetCbe a cohesive set. Let Abe a computable (2,0) : 1structure
with bounded endpath character and with ﬁnitely many (inclu ding 0) elements
inA−f(A)of inﬁnite length. Then/producttext
CAandAhave the same number of
ω-chains.
Proof. LetB= ΠCA. LetM∈ωbe the least upper bound for the endpath
character of A; that is,M= max{k:/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χendpath (A)}.
Suppose that in Bwe choose [ψ]∈B−f(B) such that [ ψ] is an element of an
ω-chain. We will show that [ ψ] belongs to the range of the canonical embedding
function of AinfoB.
Consider a c.e. set W={i∈ω:ψ(i)↑ ∨l(ψ(i))>M}, which is inﬁnite. We
claim thatC⊆∗W. To establish the claim, assume otherwise, hence C⊆∗W.
We have that W={i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧l(ψ(i))≤M}so it is a ﬁnite union of c.e.
setsYjforj∈ {1,...,M}where
Yj=/uniontext
0≤k<j{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧fj(ψ(i))↓=fk(ψ(i))↓ ∧
/logicalandtext
0≤m<n<jfm(ψ(i))↓/ne}a⊔ionslash=fn(ψ(i))↓}.
Hence, since Cis cohesive, for some j0,k0such thatj0>k0we have that
C⊆∗{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧fj0(ψ(i))↓=fk0(ψ(i))↓ ∧
/logicalandtext
0≤m<n<j 0fm(ψ(i))↓/ne}a⊔ionslash=fn(ψ(i))↓},
18which will imply that fj0[ψ] =fk0[ψ], contradicting the fact that [ ψ] is an
element of an ω-chain. Hence
C⊆∗W={i∈ω:ψ(i)↑ ∨l(ψ(i))>M}.
SinceC⊆∗{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓},we have
C⊆∗{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧l(ψ(i))>M}=
{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧l(ψ(i))>M∧ψ(i)∈f(A)} ∪
{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧l(ψ(i))>M∧f(i)∈A−f(A)}.
We can further show that C⊆∗{i∈ω:ψ(i)↓ ∧l(ψ(i))>M∧f(i)∈A−f(A)}
since, otherwise, there is [ τ]∈Bsuch thatf([τ]) = [ψ], contradicting the fact
that [ψ]∈B−f(B).
Hence,C⊆∗/uniontext{Xa:a∈(A−f(A))∧l(a) =∞}.By assumption, the union
in the previous formula is a ﬁnite union, so for some a0,we have
C⊆ {i∈ω:ψ(i)↓=a0}.
Thus, [ψ] belongs to the range of the canonical embedding. It follows that t he
number ofω-chains is the same in AandB.
For the following result we require more decidability in a computable str uc-
ture.
Deﬁnition 30 [4] A computable (2,0) : 1structure A= (A,f)is said to be
highly computable ifran(f)is a computable set.
Theorem 31 LetCbe a cohesive set. Let Abe a highly computable (2,0) : 1
structure with unbounded endpath character or with inﬁnite ly many elements in
A−f(A)of inﬁnite length. Then ΠCAhas inﬁnitely many ω-chains.
Hence if Ahas only ﬁnitely many ω-chains, we have A≇ΠCA.
Proof. LetB= ΠCA. Letg:ω→Abe a computable function such that
g(ω)⊆A−f(A) and for every m∈ωwe have
|{fk(g(n)) :fk(g(n))↓ ∧0≤n≤m∧0≤k≤m}=(m+1)(m+2)
2.
A partial function ψm,n:ω→Aform,n∈ωis deﬁned as follows:
ψm,n(x) =/braceleftbigg
fn(g(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,x/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)) if 0≤n≤ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,x/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔;
↑ otherwise.
It follows that every [ ψm,n]∈B. Ifn1/ne}a⊔ionslash=n2,then [(ψm,n1)]/ne}a⊔ionslash= [(ψm,n2)].
Furthermore, [( ψm,0)]∈B−f(B) andf([ψm,n]) = [ψm,n+1] , so{[ψm,n] :n∈ω}
is a subset of an ω-chain. For any pair of natural numbers m1,m2such that
m1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2and arbitrary k1,k2, we havefk1([ψm1,0])/ne}a⊔ionslash=fk2([ψm2,0]), so [ψm1,0]
and [ψm2,0] belong to diﬀerent ω-chains. Hence Bhas inﬁnitely many ω-chains.
19Corollary 32 IfAis a highly computable (2,0) : 1structure with unbounded
endpath character and no ω-chains. Let Cbe a cohesive set, and B=/producttext
CA.
Then there is a computable Σ2sentenceαsuch that B/satisfiesαandA/notsatisfiesα.
Proof. The property that there is an ω-chain can be expressed by a computable
(inﬁnitary) Σ 2sentenceα:
∃x(/logicalandtext
y∈A(x/ne}a⊔ionslash=f(y))∧/logicalandtext
l≥0∧k>0(f(l+k)(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=fn(x)))
7 Partial injection structures
Apartial injection structure (A,f) consists of a set Aand a partial function
f:A→Asuch that if x,y∈dom(f) andx/ne}a⊔ionslash=y, thenf(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=f(y).We will call
fapartial injection . As usual, we write f(x)↓to denote that x∈dom(f),and
f(x)↑to denote that x /∈dom(f). Also,f(x)↓ystands forf(x)↓andf(x) =y.
Partial inverse function f−1is deﬁned naturally. For z∈Z,fzis deﬁned as
the usual composition of partial functions. Partial injection stru ctures and their
computability-theoretic properties, including complexity of their iso morphisms,
were studied by Marshall in [21]. She calls a partial injection structur e (A,f) a
partial computable injection structure ifAa computable set and fis a partial
computable function.
In order to make a partial injection structure ( A,f) into a ﬁrst-order struc-
ture, we will consider it as a relational structure A= (A,Gf), whereGfis the
graph off:
Gf={(x,y) :x∈dom(f)∧f(x) =y}.
Having this framework in mind, we can still write ( A,f).
Deﬁnition 33 We say that a partial computable injection structure (A,f)is
acomputable partial injection structure ifGfis a computable binary relation.
Hence (A,Gf)is a computable structure.
Proposition 34 Let(A,f)be a partial computable injection structure.
(i) Ifran(f)is computable, then Gfis computable.
(ii) Ifdom(f)is computable, then Gfis computable.
Proof. (i) Without loss of generality, we may assume that A=ω. Given a pair
(x,y),ﬁrst determine whether y∈ran(f).Ify /∈ran(f), then (x,y)/∈Gf.Ify∈
ran(f),then run a Turing machine program Pffor computing fsimultaneously
on 0,1,2,...by adding more and more inputs and computation steps (although
ﬁnitely many at every stage) until we ﬁnd zsuch that the program Pfhalts on
zand outputs y. Ifx=zthen (x,y)∈Gf,and ifx/ne}a⊔ionslash=zthen (x,y)/∈Gf.
(ii) Given a pair ( x,y),ﬁrst determine whether x∈dom(f),and if that is
the case compute f(x).
20The domain of a partial computable injection function with computab le
range does not have to be computable. For example, for the halting setK,
consider a computable 1 −1 enumeration g:ω→K. Letf:ω→ωbe deﬁned
as:
f(x) =/braceleftbiggg−1(x) ifx∈K
↑ otherwise
Thenfis a partial computable injection with ran(f) =ωanddom(f) =K.
Let (A,f) be a partial injection structure. The orbit of ais deﬁned to be:
Of(a) ={b:∃n∈ω(fn(a)↓=b∨fn(b)↓=a)}.
There are ﬁve kinds of orbits. Finite orbits may be k-cycles ork-chains for
k≥1.Ak-chain is of the form {xi: 1≤i≤k}wherexi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xjfor 1≤i<j≤k
andx1∈A−ran(f),xi+1=f(xi), andxk/∈dom(f). Inﬁnite orbits may be
Z-chains,ω-chains, orω∗-chains. An ω∗-chain is of the form {xi:i∈ω}where
x0∈A−dom(f),xi=f(xi+1), andxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xjfori/ne}a⊔ionslash=j.
Deﬁnition 35 LetA= (A,f)be a partial injection structure. In the following
deﬁnitions we will assume that k,n∈ω−{0}.
(a) Thecycle character ofAis
χcycle(A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:Ahas/greaterorequalslantnmanyk-cycles}.
(b) Theﬁnite chain character ofAis
χpath(A) ={/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔:Ahas/greaterorequalslantnmanyk-chains}.
We say that a character in the previous deﬁnition is bounded if there is
an upper bound on the size k. Two countable partial injection structures are
isomorphic if and only if they have the same cycle character, the sam e ﬁnite
chain character nd the same number of Z-chains,ω-chains and ω∗-chains.
LetA= (A,f) be a computable partial injection structure. Let Cbe a
cohesive set, and B= ΠCA. ThenfB([ψ])↓ifC⊆∗{i∈ω:f(ψ(i))↓}and
fB([ψ])↑otherwise. Similarly, fB([ψ]) = [φ] if and only if C⊆∗{i∈ω:
f(ψ(i))↓=φ(i)↓}. We often omit the superscript in fB.
The following proposition is based on Theorem 2.
Theorem 36 LetA= (A,f)be a computable partial injection structure. Let C
be a cohesive set. Then the cohesive power ΠCAis a partial injection structure
that has the same cycle character and ﬁnite chain character a sA.
Proof. Being a partial injection structure can be described by the following Π0
1
sentences:
∀x∀y∀z[(f(x) =z∧f(y) =z)⇒x=y]
∀x∀y∀z[(f(x) =y∧f(x) =z)⇒y=z]
21Furthermore,
/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χcycle(A) iﬀ
∃x1···∃xn[/logicalandtext
1≤i≤n(fk(xi) =xi∧/logicalandtext
1≤l<kfl(xi)/ne}a⊔ionslash=xi)∧/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤n&1≤l<kfl(xi)/ne}a⊔ionslash=

which is a Σ0
1sentence.
Also,
/an}bracke⊔le{⊔k,n/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔ ∈χpath(A) iﬀ
∃x1···∃xn∃y1···∃yk∀y[/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj∧/logicalandtext
1≤i≤n(f(y)/ne}a⊔ionslash=xi∧fk−1(xi) =
yi∧f(yi)/ne}a⊔ionslash=y)],
which is a Σ0
2sentence.
In some cases, the cohesive power is isomorphic to the original stru cture.
Theorem 37 LetAbe a computable partial injection structure with bounded
cycle character, bounded ﬁnite chain character, and no inﬁn ite orbits. Let Cbe
a cohesive set. Then A∼=ΠCA.
Proof. LetA= (A,f) andB= ΠCA. LetMbe the maximum size of ﬁnite
orbits. Since Ahas no inﬁnite orbits, it satisﬁes the following Π0
2sentence:
¬∃x∃y(fM+1(x) =y∧/logicalandtext
1≤i≤M(fi(x)/ne}a⊔ionslash=x)).
HenceBsatisﬁes the same sentence, so it has no inﬁnite orbits. Thus, toge ther
with Theorem 36, we have A∼=B.
If the conditions of the previous theorem are not satisﬁed, the co hesive power
will have inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
Theorem 38 LetAbe a computable partial injection structure with unbounded
cycle character, or with unbounded ﬁnite chain character, o r with an inﬁnite
orbit. LetCbe a cohesive set. Then ΠCAhas inﬁnitely many Z-chains.
Hence if Ahas only ﬁnitely many Z-chains, then A≇ΠCA.
Proof. The proof is similar to that of part (ii) of Theorem 22.
The cohesive power always has at least as many orbits of a certain ﬁx ed type
asA. In some cases the number of ω-chains and ω∗-chans is the same.
Theorem 39 LetAbe a computable partial injection structure with bounded
ﬁnite chain character. Let Cbe a cohesive set. Then ΠCAhas the same number
ofω-chains and the same number of ω∗-chains as A.
22Proof. LetA= (A,f) andB= ΠCA. LetMbe the maximum size of ﬁnite
chains. The property that Ahas≥nmanyω-chains can be expressed by the
following Σ0
2sentence:
∃x1···∃xn∃y1···∃yn∀z[/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj∧/logicalandtext
1≤i≤n(fM(xi) =yi∧f(z)/ne}a⊔ionslash=
xi)]
HenceAandBhave the same number of ω-chains.
Similarly, the property that Ahas≥nmanyω∗-chains can be expressed by
the following Σ0
2sentence:
∃x1···∃xn∃y1···∃yn∀z[/logicalandtext
1≤i<j≤nxi/ne}a⊔ionslash=xj∧/logicalandtext
1≤i≤n(fM(yi) =xi∧f(xi)/ne}a⊔ionslash=
z)].
Theorem 40 LetA= (A,f)be a computable partial injection structure with
unbounded ﬁnite chain character. Let Cbe a cohesive set.
(i) Assume that ran(f)is computable. Then ΠCAhas inﬁnitely many ω-
chains.
Hence if Ahas only ﬁnitely many ω-chains, then A≇ΠCA.
(ii) Assume that dom(f)is computable. Then ΠCAhas inﬁnitely many
ω∗-chains.
Hence if Ahas only ﬁnitely many ω∗-chains, then A≇ΠCA.
Proof. (i) Proof is similar to that of Theorem 31.
(ii) Letg:ω→(A−dom(f)) be a computable function such that if natural
numbersm1,m2,n1,n2are such that m1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2orn1/ne}a⊔ionslash=n2,thenf−n1(g(m1))/ne}a⊔ionslash=
f−n2(g(m2)) wheren1≤m1andn2≤m2. Such a function exists since the
chain character is unbounded and dom(f) is computable.
We deﬁne partial function ψm,n:ω→Aform,n∈ωas follows:
ψm,n(x) =/braceleftbiggf−n(g(/an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,x/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔)) ifn≤ /an}bracke⊔le{⊔m,x/an}bracke⊔ri}h⊔;
↑ otherwise.
It follows that [ ψm,n]∈ΠCAsincedom(ψm,n) is coﬁnite. We can show that
{[ψm,n] :n∈ω}form anω∗-chains, and that for m1/ne}a⊔ionslash=m2we have that [ ψm1,0]
and [ψm2,0] belong to diﬀerent ω∗-chains. Hence Π CAhas inﬁnitely many ω∗-
chains.
238 Concluding remarks
In this paper, we focus on the isomorphism types of cohesive power s of certain
computable structures with a single binary relation, such as graphs , equivalence
structures, and partial injection structures. This adds to the p revious study of
the cohesive powers of the ordered set of natural numbers, ( ω,<), and other
natural linear orders in [14, 13]. Here, we also investigate cohesive powers of
computable structures with a unary function that is one-to-one, two-to-one, and
(2,0) : 1, which can be identiﬁed with the directed graphs they induce. I t will
be worthwhile to investigate the isomorphism types of cohesive powe rs of other
directed graphs induced by functions. Some structures in the clas ses we consider
are isomorphic to all of their cohesive powers. It was previously kno wn that this
is also true for ﬁnite structures, ordered set of rationals, rando m graph, and the
countable atomless Boolean algebra. Some structures in the classe s we consider
are not isomorphic to their cohesive powers, having properties tha t distinguish
them and that can be described by computable (inﬁnitary) sentenc es.
Our goal is to further develop the theory of cohesive powers and, more gen-
erally, cohesive products of eﬀective structures by investigating their algebraic,
computability-theoretic, and syntactic properties. We would like to include
more complicated algebraic structures such as semigroups, group s, rings, and
ﬁelds. Cohesive powers of computable ﬁelds will extend the earlier st udy of
cohesive powers of the ﬁeld of rationals, ( Q,+,),in [12] and will have further
applications in the study of the lattice of c.e. vector spaces and the ir automor-
phisms, thus generalizing results in [11].
