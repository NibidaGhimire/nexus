Abstract
We propose a general stochastic formalism for describing th e evolution of chemical reactions
involving a ﬁnite number of molecules. This approach is cons istent with the statistical analysis
basedontheChemicalMasterEquation, andprovidestheform alsettingfortheexistingalgorithmic
approaches (Gillespie algorithm). Some practical advanta ges of this formulation are addressed, and
several examples are discussed pointing out the connection with quantum transitions (radiative
interactions).

1All the chemical physical processes involve, in an atomistic perspec tive, a stochastic de-
scription of the events, be them reactive or associated with a chan ge of phase (for instance
adsorption)[1]. Nonetheless, intheoverwhelming majorityoftheca sesofpracticalandlabo-
ratory interest, the number of molecules involved is so large to just ify a mean ﬁeld approach,
essentially based on theBoltzmannian hypothesis of molecular chaos (the “stosszahlansatz”)
[2]. The mean ﬁeld formulation represents the backbone of the class ical theory of chemical
reaction kinetics [3, 4].
It is well known that, in all the cases where the number of molecule is s mall (and this
occurs insubcellular biochemical reactions, innanoscale systems, o rinthe growthkinetics of
microorganisms [5–7]), the eﬀects of ﬂuctuations become signiﬁcan t, motivating a stochastic
description of chemical kinetic processes, involving the number of m olecules present in the
system, thusexplicitlyaccountingforduetotheirﬁnitenumber[8– 11]. Thestatisticaltheory
ofchemical kineticsintheseconditionsisgroundedontheChemical M asterEquation(CME)
[12, 13], expressing the evolution equation for the probabilities p(N,t) of all the possible
number-conﬁgurations N(t) = (N1(t),...,N s(t)), where Nh(t) is the number of molecules of
theh-th reacting species at time t,h= 1,...,s. However, apart from a handful of simple
cases, for which the CME can be solved analytically [14], numerical me thods should be
applied to it in order to compute mean values and higher-order momen ts. But also this
choice reveals itself to be unfeasible in most of the situations of prac tical and theoretical
interests, due to the extremely large number of conﬁgurations inv olved, making the multi-
index matrix p(N,t) so huge to exceed reasonable computational facilities.
In order to solve this problem, Gillespie proposed an algorithmic solutio n to the numeri-
cal simulation of stochastic reacting systems, based on the Marko vian nature of the reactive
events [15, 16]. The original Gillespie algorithm has been extended and improved over time,
providing a variety of slightly diﬀerent computational alternatives. A common denominator
of the ﬁrst family of the Gillespie algorithms (namely those based on th e direct method, the
ﬁrst reaction method or their derivates [17–19]) is to associate to e very time step the occur-
rence of just one reaction. This formulation comes directly from th e assumption that, if the
time step is small enough, the probability that more than one reactio n will occur is negligi-
ble. While correct, this choice brings to signiﬁcant computational co sts for complex reaction
schemes. This problem has been highlighted several times, from the Gillespie group itself,
asstiﬀness in stochastic chemical reacting systems [20]. A brilliant way to overc ome this
2limit originates the famous tau-leaping method, which, unfortunate ly, requires to check that
the propensity functions remain almost constant at each iteration and can be applied just
if this condition is veriﬁed [21, 22]. The algorithmic solution associated with the formalism
here introduced combines the accuracy of the ﬁrst SSA with the co mputational advantages
of theτ-leaping method.
There is, moreover, a missing link between the CME theory and the Gille spie algorithm,
consisting in the straight mathematical formulation of the stochas tic diﬀerential equations
associated with a chemical reacting system, the statistical descr iption of which would cor-
respond to the CME. To clarify this issue, consider the conceptually analogous problem of
particle diﬀusion over the real line, the statistical description of wh ich is expressed by the
parabolicequation ∂p(x,t)/∂t=D∂2p(x,t)/∂x2,fortheprobabilitydensity p(x,t)ofﬁnding
a particle at position xat timet. Setting xn=x(n∆t), an algorithm describing this process
can be simply expressed by the discrete evolution equation xn+1=xn+√
2D∆trn+1, where
rh,h= 1,2,...represent independent random variables sampled from a normal dis tribution
(with zero mean, and unit variance) [23]. This represents an eﬃcient algorithmic solution
of the problem, whenever the time resolution ∆ tis small enough. Nevertheless, the mere
algorithmic approach cannot be considered physically satisfactory , in a comprehensive for-
mulation of transport theory embedded in a continuous space-time (in which both position x
and time tare real valued). In point of fact, only with the mathematical form ulation due to
K. Ito of stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by the increment sdw(t) of a Wiener process
(Langevin equations) [24], namely dx(t) =√
2Ddw(t) the theory of diﬀusive motion has
found a proper mathematical physical setting.
A similar situation applies to the case of stochastic models of chemical reaction kinetics,
and the present Letter is aimed at ﬁlling this gap. The basic idea is that any reactive
process corresponds to a system of elementary events (the sing le reaction) possessing a
Markovian transitional structure, and, consequently, amenable to a description by means
of the increments of counting processes (Poisson processes, in t he Markovian case). This
topic has been also pointed out in [25] in terms of Poisson measures, although the latter
formulation is much less simple and physically intuitive than the approac h proposed in the
present Letter.
To begin with, consider the simple case of a ﬁrst-order chemical rea ctionAk1⇋
k−1B(for
instance, an isomerization). This model is perfectly analogous to th e radiative transition

order chemical kinetics, such as an isomerization.
of a molecule possessing two energy states, due to emission and ads orption of an energy
quantum (ﬁgure 1). Let NA(0)+NB(0) =Ngthe total number of molecules at time t= 0.
The state of the system is characterized by the state functions σh(t),h= 1,...,N gfor each
molecule, attaining values {0,1}, and such that σh(t) = 0 if the energy state at time tisE0
(or equivalently if the molecule ﬁnds itself in the state A), andσh(t) = 1 in the opposite
case (energy state E1, or isomeric state B).

The analytical formulation of a stochastic diﬀerential equation for chemical kinetics,
expressed in terms of the number of molecules of the chemical spec ies involved, rather than
analgorithm deﬁned for discretized times, permits to develop a varie ty of diﬀerent numerical
strategies, that naturally perform a modiﬁed tau-leaping procedu re, as the occurrence of
several distinct reactive events in any elementary time step ∆ tis intrinsically accounted for.
This can be easily seen by considering the simple reaction deﬁned by th e evolution equation
(2). In terms of increments, eq. (2) can be written as dNB(t) =/summationtextNA(t)

K∆t <1, K= max{k1,k−1} (6)
In practice, we choose ∆ t= 0.1/K. As can be observed, the choice of ∆ tis limited by the
intrinsic rates of the process. The advantage of deriving diﬀerent algorithmic schemes for
5solving numerically the stochastic kinetic equations becomes more ev ident in dealing with
bimolecular reactions (addressed below). Due to the intrinsic limitatio ns of this commu-
nication, a thorouh discussion of this issue is postponed to a future more extensive article
[26].
The same approach can be extended to include amongst the element ary events not only
the reactive steps, but also feeding conditions, thus representin g the evolution of chemically
reacting systems witha ﬁnitenumber ofmolecules ina perfectly stirr ed openreactor. This is
the case of the tank-loading problem, in which a tracer is injected in a n open vessel assumed
perfectly mixed, for which, in the absence of chemical reactions, t he mean ﬁeld equation for
the concentration of the tracer reads
dc(t)
dt=D(c0−c(t)) (7)
wherec0is the inlet concentration and Dthe dilution rate (reciprocal of the mean retention
time), and c(0) = 0. Fixing Ngso thatc(t) =c0N(t)/Ng, the corresponding stochastic
diﬀerential equation for the integer N(t) involves, also in this case, two families of counting
processes, onefor theloading at constant concentration c0, andthe other for tracer discharge

Indeed, there is a two-fold use of the stochastic formulation of ch emical kinetic schemes.
The ﬁrst refers to a chemical reacting system involving a small numb er of molecules, and
in this case Ngrepresents the eﬀective number of molecules present in the syste m. The
other is to use stochastic algorithms for simulating reacting system s in an alternative (and
sometimes more eﬃcient way) with respect to the solution of the cor responding mean-ﬁeld
equations. In the latter case, the granularity number Ngrepresents essentially a computa-
tional parameter, tuning the intensity of the ﬂuctuations. Two ch oices are then possible:
(i) it can be chosen large enough, in order to obtain from a single realiz ation of the process
an accurate approximation of the mean-ﬁeld behavior, or (ii) it can b e chosen small enough

in order, to deal with extremely fast simulations of a single realization of the process, that
could be averaged over a statistically signiﬁcant number of realizatio ns in due time. These
two choices are depicted in ﬁgure 2 (panel c), choosing Ng= 103, and in ﬁgure 3 panel (a)
obtained for Ng= 30. Of course, the latter approach is valid as long as the low-granu larity
(low values of Ng) does not inﬂuence the qualitative properties of the kinetics.
The second (computational) use of stochastic simulations of chemic al kinetics requires a
further discussion. At a ﬁrst sight, it may appear that any stocha stic simulation would be
computationally less eﬃcient than the solution of the corresponding mean-ﬁeld equations.
This is certainly true for classical chemical reaction schemes in a per fectly mixed system,

for which the mean-ﬁeld model reduces to a system of ordinary diﬀe rential equations for
the concentrations of the reactants. But there are kinetic prob lems e.g., associated with the
growth of microorganisms and eukaryotic cell lines in bioreactors (t hese growth phenom-
ena, are indeed amenable to a description in terms of equivalent chem ical reactions), the
mean-ﬁeld model of which is expressed in the form of higher-dimensio nal nonlinear integro-
diﬀerential equations . For this class of problems, the use of stoch astic simulations is the
8most eﬃcient, if not the only way to achieve a quantitative descriptio n of the process, in
those cases where the number npof internal parameters describing the physiological state
of an eukaryotic cell becomes large enough, np≥3. This issue is addressed in detail in [27].
This case isaltogether similar to some transport problems, such asT aylor-Aris dispersion for
high P´ eclet numbers or the analysis of microﬂuidic separation proce sses (DLD devices) for
which thestochastic simulationofparticlemotionisfarmoreeﬃcient t hat thecorresponding
solution of the corresponding mean-ﬁeld model expressed in the fo rm of advection-diﬀusion

To complete the analysis of the tank-loading problem, the associate d CME reads

The above approach can be extended to any system of nonlinear re action schemes involv-
ing unimolecular and bimolecular reaction, and in the presence of slow/ fast kinetics. The
structure of the reaction mechanism can be arbitrarily complicated without adding any fur-
ther complexity (other than purely notational) in the formulation of the stochastic evolution
expressed in terms of number of molecules. The only practical issue , is that the number
of diﬀerent families of stochastic processes grows with the number of elementary reactive
processes considered. For instance, in the case of the subtrate -inhibited Michaelin-Menten
kinetics

there are ﬁve reactive processes (ﬁve channels in the language of the Gillespie algorithm)
and consequently ﬁve families of counting processes {χ(h)

This is just one possibility, out of other fully equivalent alternatives, of deﬁning bimolecular
reacting processes, and out of tem a numerical algorithm for solvin g them. This issue, and
its computational implications will be addressed elsewhere [26]. The g ranularity number Ng
can be ﬁxed, so that
NS(0) = [cS,0Ng], N E,0= [cE,0Ng] (13)
where [ξ] indicates the integer part of ξ, thus deﬁning the relation betwen Nα(t) andcα(t),
namelycα(t) =Nα(t)/Ng,α=S, E, ES, ESS, P . This implies also that the eﬀective rate
parameters entering the discrete stochastic evolution equation ( 12), and associated with the
two bimolecular reactive steps, are given by /tildewidek1=k1/Ng, and/tildewidek3=k3/Ng.
Consider the case k−1=k2=k3=k−3= 1,cS,0= 4,cE,0= 0.1. In this case the

To conclude, we want to point out some advantages and extensions of the present ap-
proach:
•it shows a direct analogy between chemical reaction kinetics, radiat ive processes and
stochastic formulation of open quantum systems, thus, paving th e way for a uniﬁed
treatment of the interpaly between these phenomena, that is par ticularly important
in the ﬁeld of photochemistry, and in the foundation of statistical p hysics [30, 31];
•it can be easily extended to semi-Markov transition. This is indeed the case of the
growth kinetics of eukaryotic microorganisms, the physiological st ate of which can
be parametrized with respect to internal (hidden) parameters su ch as the age, the
cytoplasmatic content, etc.;
•it can be easily extended to include transport phenomena. In point o f fact, the oc-
currence of Markovian or semi-Markovian transitions in modeling che mical kinetics is
11analogous to the transitions occurring in the direction of motion (Po isson-Kac pro-
cesses, L´ evy ﬂights, Extended Poisson-Kac processes) or in th e velocity (linearized
Boltzmannian schemes) [32–34].
•it is closely related to the formulation of stochastic diﬀerential equa tions for the ther-
malization of athermal system [35], in which the classical mesoscopic d escription of
thermal ﬂuctuations, using the increments of a Wiener process, is replaced by a dy-
namic model involving the increments of a counting process.
DuetothelimitationsofaLetter,alltheseissueswillbeaddressedin forthcomingworks. But
apart for these extensions and improvements, the proposed for mulation indicates that the
stochastic theory of chemical reactions can be built upon a simple an d consistent mathemat-
ical formalism describing the elementary reactive events as Markov ian or semi-Markovian
counting processes [36], that perfectly ﬁts with the description of molecular non reactive
events (molecular collisions), providing an unifying stochastic forma lism of elementary (clas-
sical and quantum) molecular events.
