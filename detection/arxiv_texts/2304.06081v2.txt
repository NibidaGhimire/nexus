We obtain approximate solutions defining the mobility edge separating localized and extended
states for several classes of generic one-dimensional quasiperiodic models. We validate our analytical
ansatz with exact numerical calculations. Rather amazingly, we provide a single simple ansatz for
the generic mobility edge, which is satisfied by quasiperiodic models involving many different types
of nonsinusoidal incommensurate potentials as well as many different types of long-range hopping
models. Our ansatz agrees precisely with the well-known limiting cases of the sinusoidal Aubry-
André model (which has no mobility edge) and the generalized Aubry-André models (which have
analytical mobility edges). Our work provides a practical tool for estimating the location of mobility
edges in quasiperiodic systems.
I. Introduction
Anderson localization1–3is a great pillar of
fundamental physics, where disorder may quantum
mechanically suppress the coherent metallic transport
leading to an insulating behavior as the extended states
of the clean system become localized by the disorder.
In three dimensions, Anderson localization allows for
the mobility edge where the single-particle spectrum
has a disorder-dependent critical energy separating
the localized states from the extended states (and
the localization leads to a metal-insulator transition
as the Fermi level goes through the mobility edge).
By contrast, disorder-induced Anderson localization is
trivial in one dimension (1D) since any disorder localizes
all states with no mobility edge and no metal-insulator
transition.
There are, however, situations where localization
can emerge from a deterministic model. A prime
example is when the Hamiltonian is incommensurate
to the underlying 1D lattice, giving rise to the class
of quasiperiodic systems. Such incommensuration, for
example, can be incorporated into the onsite potential
such that
H=L
∑
i=1(c†
ici+1+H.c.)+W(2πβi+ϕ)c†
ici(1)
where the nearest-neighbor hopping energy and the
lattice constant are chosen as units of energy and length,
respectively. Here W(x)=W(x+2π)is periodic
but incommensurate with the underlying lattice ( i∈
Z) for an irrational β. The simplest such model is
the Aubry-André (AA)4with nearest-neighbor hopping
and a quasiperiodic sinusoidal potential incommensurate
with the lattice W(2πβi+ϕ)=Vcos(2πβi+ϕ). The
AA model is known to have a quasiperiodic potential-
tuned localization transition at V=2where all
states are extended (localized) for V<(>)2. The
quasiperiodic AA system is self-dual at the critical point
V=2with identical real space and momentum space
representations, thus indicating an energy-independentlocalization transition for the whole spectrum with no
mobility edges.
It has been known since almost the beginning
of the subject5–15that breaking this fine-tuned AA
duality (while still maintaining quasiperiodicity) leads
to an energy-dependent self-duality relation, and
hence, mobility edges. For example, adding a
second incommensurate potential (e.g., a cos(4πβi)
term) or adding a next-nearest-neighbor hopping term
immediately takes the system away from the fine-
tuned AA self-duality, producing a mobility edge. In
particular, within a well-defined range of values of V=
max xW(x), there could be a critical energy Ec, defining
the mobility edge, separating extended states (localized)
states for E>(<)Ecfor a given Hamiltonian. Such
mobility edges in generic quasiperiodic problems are
primarily obtained and studied numerically. However,
there are a few well-known examples in the literature
where analytical solutions have been derived for the
mobility edge. One example is the model of Ref.16,
the Biddle-Das Sarma (BD) model, where the kinetic
energy hopping term in the AA model (i.e., the first
term in Eq. (1)) is long-ranged, but in an exponentially
decayingspatialform. AnotheristhemodelofRef.17,the
Ganeshan-Pixley-Das Sarma (GPD) model, where the
quasiperiodic potential (i.e., the second term in Eq. (1))
is modified essentially to include all higher harmonics of
the basic sinusoidal AA incommensurate potential, again
leading to an energy-dependent analytically tractable
self-duality producing mobility edges. In general, from
a prior dual transformation, one can construct a model
with analytic mobility edge10–15. These models could
be construed as the different generic possible classes
representing generalized AA (GAA) models, where either
the hopping kinetic energy or the incommensurate
potential energy term is modified. We mention that the
theoretically predicted mobility edges in GAA models
have been experimentally observed18–21. However, a
reversed problem, i.e., locating the mobility edge given a
Hamiltonian is not well studied.
In the current work, we present a rather unexpectedarXiv:2304.06081v2  [cond-mat.dis-nn]  29 Jun 20232
theoretical result: We provide an approximate simple-
looking ansatz for two distinct generic classes of
GAA models in one stroke, one with nearest-neighbor
hopping as in Eq. (1), but with non-sinusoidal potential
comprising multiple powers of cosine potentials as the
incommensurate term, and the other with the simple
quasiperiodic potential of Eq. (1), but with multiple
long-range hopping terms. In the appropriate limits,
our results reduce to the established analytical results of
AA, BD, and GPD models, and we numerically validate
our generic mobility edge results by comparing direct
numerical simulations with our analytical theoretical
ansatz. Although our theoretical ansatz is not exact, it
tends to agree with the numerically calculated mobility
edges up to a few percent deviations, even when
the mobility edge has nontrivial and nonmonotonic
structures in the parameter space of the quasiperiodic
potential strength. Our finding can be directly
experimentally verified and shows the richness of the
quasiperiodic 1D localization compared with the simple
random disorder-induced Anderson localization.
Our work is deeply connected to a mathematical
question of whether a self-adjoint operator has a
pure point (bound state), absolutely continuous (free
state), or singular continuous spectrum22–29. Instead
of focusing on the mathematical rigor, we aim at a
moreexperimentallyrelevantgoal, i.e., an estimation of
mobility edge given a generic Hamiltonian. We mention
that since our argument is based on duality, the ansatz
should hold for most values of irrational βand phase ϕ,
but there might exist some exceptions. This is similar to
the AA model for V>2that has a singular continuous
spectrum (instead of pure point spectrum for localized
states) if βis a Liouville number or a dense set of ϕif
W(x)=W(−x). We note that these exceptions form
a zero-measure set mathematically, so the AA duality
argument typically holds.II. Hidden duality and Mobility edge ansatz
We consider a generic potential W(2πβi+ϕ)that
is periodic under 2πtranslation W(x)=W(x+2π).
Ifi∈ Z(site index in tight-binding models) and βis
irrational, the potential never repeats itself exactly and
the system is quasiperiodic. This makes directly solving
the Hamiltonian difficult since one cannot use the ansatz
ofBlochwavefunctionswhen βisrational. Onetrickisto
approximate β≈n2/n1(assuming β<1so that n2<n1)
andmakethesystemsizelessthanorequalto n2. Inthat
case, the potential is periodic under n1−site translation
so that one can use Bloch wave ansatz. However, the
period is longer than the system size, which makes the
system physically aperiodic. This method was used by
Aubry and André to derive the famous duality in the
AA model, where self-dual points mark the localized-
extended transition. To make any connection to the
thermodynamic limit, one has to take the limit n2→
∞, which means the irrational βis approximated with
increasing accuracy. We note that n2does not appear
explicitly in the AA duality, so the limit taking is only
implied.
A similar duality, called hidden duality30–32, can
also be established in other quasiperiodic models using
rational approximation. Assuming β≈n2/n1, the lattice
now has an enlarged unit cell of n1physical sites and
can be solved in terms of rescaled Bloch momentum κ=
k/n1∈[−π, π]. Because of the translational invariance
under shifting n1sites, the phase ϕof Eq. (1) is also
rescaled into φ=ϕ/n1∈[−π, π]. We can then solve
the Fermi surface in the 2D (κ, φ)phase by solving the
matrix
H(κ, φ)=⎛

where W(ϕ)is the quasi-periodic potential except for the
replacement βwith n2/n1.
It is hypothesized that in the limit n1, n2→∞and
at the self-dual point (E, V)point, the Fermi surface is
invariant under the exchange (cosκ↔cosφ)or(cosκ↔
−cosφ). This duality is not guaranteed for finite n1, but
one can still numerically obtain a best-fit point that is
most invariant under φ↔κexchange, which converges
to the true self-dual point in the large n1limit30–32.The commensurate approximation can be tested
analytically for AA and GPD models because the duality
holds for any n1. We start from the simplest n1=1, then
for AA potential W(φ)=Vcosφ
E(κ, ϕ)=Vcosφ+2 cosκ, (3)
which is self-dual for V=±2. For the GPD potential3

the Fermi surface is invariant under the φ↔κexchange.
W(φ)=Vcosφ/(1−αcosφ)
E(κ, ϕ)=Vcosφ/(1−αcosφ)+2 cosκ
⇔(Eα+V)cosφ+2 cosκ−2αcosφcosκ−E=0,(4)
which is self-dual at V=±2−Eα.
In the two examples above of analytical duality, the
potential contains either a single cosine harmonic (AA
model) or an exponential series (GDP model). In this
paper, weare interested in a genericcase given by a series
of cosine with arbitrary coefficients
W(φ)=Vcosφ(1+m
∑
l=1αlcoslφ) (5)
For the generic set of {αl}, the Fermi surface at
n1−rational approximant is a solution of
Pn1[W(φ);E, V]+2 cosκ=0 (6)
where Pn1[W(φ);E, V]is an n1−order polynomial
function of W(φ)with EandVas parameters. For
finite n1, an exact dual point in general cannot be found
because cosκandcosφexist in different powers; only
forn1→∞that the polynomial function reduces to a
different function, e.g., by Taylor series, that the exact
duality is achieved. At n1=1, we have
E=2 cosκ+Vcosφ(1+m
∑
l=1αlcoslφ)(7)
Instead of requiring the entire Fermi surface to
be invariant under φ↔κ, which is impossible
mathematically, we only impose this condition on a pair
of points with either cosφ=0orcosκ=0. For cosφ=0,
cosκ=E/2, this point must be mapped to cosφ=E/2
andcosκ=0, yielding
E=EV

l=1αl(E

] (8)
and consequently, an approximated mobility edge
V=2[1+m
∑
l=1αl(E
2)l
]−1
. (9)We note that the exchange cosφ↔−cosκyields another
mobility edge for V<0, but for conciseness, we only
focus on the V>0side. The matching condition
can be imposed on higher-order approximations of
βcorresponding to larger n1, which will most likely
improve the mobility edge prediction. However, Eq. 9
will become much more complicated with multiple
powers of cosκand cosφ, and the corresponding
theoretical prediction loses its simplicity and practical
utility.
We now benchmark our ansatz (9) against the
numerical self-duality. For this purpose, we set β=
(√
5−1)/2for simplicity so that βcan be progressively
approximated by Fm/Fm+1where Fmis a Fibonacci
number. We first check the “numerical invariance”of
the Fermi surface under φ↔κexchange at n1=1
approximant. For α1=α2=0.3andE=1.75, Eq. (9)
predicts V=1.34. AsshowninFig.1, thisvalueproduces
a visibly invariant Fermi surface as compared to adjacent
values. We then proceed with justifying the ansatz with
increasing n1. For each n1, we fix Eand tune Vto
optimize the φ↔κ-invariance. From Fig. 2, as n1→∞,
Vconverges to a value that is only a few percent off our
original guess. The reason our Fermi surface matching
condition manifests so well numerically even though an
exact φ↔κinvarianceismathematicallynotpossiblefor
n1=1is the phase locking between different harmonics,
i.e., the same phase ϕis shared among all harmonics
as shown in Eq. (5). When phase locking is relaxed, the
Fermisurfacelosesitssymmetricformandbecomesmore
complicated. In that case, our simple ansatz based on
n1=1will no longer well approximate self-dual points.
III. Numerical test on mobility edge ansatz
We benchmark our approximate mobility edge against
large-size numerical simulations using β=(√
5−1)/2
andL=2584in Eq. (1) with the periodic boundary
condition. To quantify the localization degree of each
eigenwavefunction and identify the mobility edge, we4

A. Nearest-neighbor hopping and nonsinusoidal
potential
We first justify our ansatz for a class of generalized
AA models whose quasiperiodic models contain a series
of higher powers of cosine given by Eq. (5). When all
theαlcoefficients in this series are zero, we recoverthe simple sinusoidal quasiperiodicity of the AA model.
Forα1nonzero, and all other αlzero, we obtain the
trichromatic incommensurate model numerically studied
in Refs.5,12. In addition, Eq. (5) reduces to the GPD
model17for exponentially decaying αl=αl, which has
an exact mobility edge given by V=2−αE, i.e., Ec=
(2−V)/α. We mention that the quasiperiodic potential
in the GPD model is defined by Vcos(2πβi+ϕ)/[1−
αcos(2πβi+ϕ)]17.
Before numerically testing the generic {αl}case, we
first discuss various limits of our ansatz, showing its
agreement with the known cases of AA and GPD results.
The AA model follows from Eq. (5) by putting all αl=
0, which then gives the localization condition, according
to our ansatz of Eq. (9), to be V=2(we focus on the
positive solution) for all energies, i.e., no mobility edge–
all states are localized (extended) for V>(<)2. This is,
of course, the AA self-dual localization condition. The
connection to the GPD model is that we set αl=αl,
which then gives, according to our ansatz of Eq. (9), the
following localization condition:
V=2[∞
∑
l=0(αE
2)l
]−1
=2(1−αE/2),(11)
leading to the mobility edge
Ec=(2−V)/α. (12)
ThisispreciselytheGPDmodelanalyticalmobilityedge.
Thus, our ansatz defined by Eq. (9) agrees with the
limiting analytical results for AA and GPD models.
To test how good our ansatz is for generic values of
αlfor a completely general quasiperiodic potential, we
show some numerical examples for a few representative
situations with finite values of α1,α2, and α3in
Fig. 3. It is obvious from Fig. 3 that our ansatz is
surprisingly robust, providing Ecas a function of V
with high accuracy. First, we only keep nonzero α1
so that the potential (5) asymptotically approaches the
GPD potential in the limit α1→0. This convergence
reflects in Fig. 3(a) for small α1; while for larger α1, as
shown in Fig. 3(b), our ansatz visibly outperforms the
GPD formula. Remarkably, even the highly nontrivial5

reentrant localization structure with Ec(Ecbeing
multivalued in Figs. 3(c) and (d) for nonzero α2andα3)
is captured correctly by our simple ansatz! This shows
that the applicable range of our ansatz is not simply
a perturbative extension of known analytic solutions
but, in fact, extends far beyond. We note that our
ansatz is less accurate when Eapproaches singularities
of Eq. (9). However, this regime tends to coincide with
the edge of the spectrum [see Fig. 3(b) and (d)] where
the mobility edge, if exist here, will not have strong effect
on measurements.
In Fig. 4, we quantify the performance of our ansatz
by comparing it with the critical point obtained from
the standard finite-size scaling. Particularly, for α1=0.4
[Fig. 4(a) and (c)], along a path in the (E, V)parametric
phase, Eq. 9 incurs an error of ∼3%. At the same time,
thenextplausibletheoreticalprediction, theGPDmodel,
suffers a much larger error of ∼20%. For a more complex
non-sinusoidal incommensurate potential with α2=0.3
andα3=0.2[Fig. 4(b) and (d)], the error is only ∼7%.
This is remarkable, given that this case has no other
theoretical prediction or analytical solution.
B. Long-range hopping and sinusoidal potential
We now turn to the second class of generic models,
which our theory captures correctly. These are
models where the AA duality is broken by long-range
(i.e., beyond nearest-neighbor) hopping terms with the
incommensurate potential remaining the same as in the
AA case.
H=∑
im
∑
l=1(tlc†
ici+l+H.c.)+Vcos(2πβi+ϕ),(13)where we fix t1=1for consistence with other parts of
the paper. For models with long-range hopping and
a simple quasiperiodic sinusoidal potential, a Fourier
transformation brings this long-range hopping model to
a nearest-neighbor hopping model with a multi-harmonic
nonsinusoidal incommensurate potential. At the n1=1
approximation,
E=2m
∑
l=1tlcos(lκ)+Vcosφ. (14)
In the BD model16, the long-range hopping case has
an exact solution when the hopping strength decays
exponentially with hopping distance, i.e., tl=e−β(l−1)
(which reduces to the AA model when β→∞, i.e., only
the nearest-neighbor hopping l=1has nonzero strength).
Substitutingthislong-rangehoppingintoEq.(14),weget
the following
E=eβ(−1+sinhβ
coshβ−cosκ)+Vcosφ.(15)
This immediately leads to
coshβcosφ−eβcosκcosφ+eβ+E
Vcosκ=const (16)
and the corresponding linear mobility edge from cosφ↔
cosκduality
V=E+eβ
coshβ. (17)
This is precisely the mobility edge formula in BD16for
an exponentially decaying hopping amplitude with 1/β
as the decay length.
For a generic long-range hopping Hamiltonian, similar
to the nonsinusoidal potential case, we cannot establish
the exact duality at n1=1. However, we can provide
an approximate mobility edge by imposing the φ↔κ
invariance on a pair of points on the Fermi surface. The
principle is completely identical to the nearest-neighbor
hopping and nonsinusoidal potential case. Up to 3-site
hopping, Eq. (14) becomes
E=Vcosφ+2 cosκ+2t2cos 2κ+2t3cos 3κ
=Vcosφ+2 cosκ+2t2(2 cos2κ−1)
+2t3(4 cos3κ−3 cosκ)(18)
Forcosκ=0,cosφ=(E+2t2)/V. Imposing the
duality between (cosκ,cosφ)=(0,(E+2t2)/V)and
((E+2t2)/V,0), we obtain the equation
E=2ξ+2t2(2ξ2−1)+2t3(4ξ3−3ξ), ξ=E+2t2
V,(19)
which is polynomial equation with multiple Vsolutions
for a fixed E. To filter unphysical solutions, we note
that in the limit tn→0,V=2, so we only use the real
solution closest to 2. We compare this prediction with6

models having finite-range hoppings: 2−site, and 3−site
hoppings in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively, and observe
a good agreement between the theoretical prediction and
the numerical results.

the regime 1<γ<2can lead to unusual states that are

algebraically decaying hopping, Eq. (14) becomes
E=Vcosφ+Liγ(eiκ)+Liγ(e−iκ),(20)
where Li γ(z)is the polylogarithm. We can apply
the same duality argument and draw an approximate
mobility edge through the parametric equations
E(z)=Liγ(eiarccos z)+Liγ(e−iarccos z),
V(z)=E(z)−E(0)
z.(21)
We note that E(z)is real only for z≤1which, in case of
γ=2, set the constraint E≤π2/3≈3.2. Our numerical
result in the main text shows that the mobility edge
extends beyond this limit. To continue the mobility edge,
forz>1, we substitute the infinite sum by a finite sum
up to the 100−order term. This prediction also agrees
with the numerical simulation shown in Fig. 5(c).
C. Long-range hopping and nonsinusoidal potential
Finally, we consider a combined generic situation
where both longer-range hopping and general
nonsinusoidal quasiperiodicity are present with the
Hamiltonian given by:
H=∑
i(c†
ici+1+t2c†
ici+2+h.c.)
+V[cos(2πβi+ϕ)+ηcos(4πβi+2ϕ)]c†
ici.(22)
For simplicity, we include only two hopping terms and
two quasiperiodic terms. Note that for η=0, themodel of Eq. (22) reduces to the extensively numerically
studied t1−t2quasiperiodic model (with t1=1by choice
here)12,16.
Ifη=t2, we can use the Fourier transform to compute
exactly the self-dual point, yielding V=2for all energy.
The situation is more complicated otherwise. The analog
of Eqs. (7) and (14) is
E=V(cosφ+ηcos 2φ)+2(cosκ+t2cos 2κ).(23)
Now, by setting either cosφ=0orcosκ=0, we obtain
two solutions, the matching of whom always yields the
trivial condition: η=t2andV=2. To circumvent this
situation, we note that in the limit t2→0(η→0), only
one solution for cosφ=0(cosκ=0) is physical. We then
enforce the duality in two cases.
•Forη>t2which can be continuously deformed to
the limit η>0andt2=0, atcosφ=0, we only
choose the solution

This is also the solution of cosφforcosκ=0, which

argumentabovebasedontheFouriertransformation. We
show the corresponding numerical results in Fig. 6.7

IV. Conclusion
We introduce in this work a simple ansatz,
extensively validated by exact numerical diagonalization,
for the mobility edges in several generic classes
of 1D quasiperiodic localization models where the
generic quasiperiodicity is nonsinusoidal, and the
hopping is long-ranged. Our ansatz matches several
existing fine-tuned limiting cases with analytic mobility
edge. However, more importantly, our ansatz
agrees exceptionally well with exact numerical results
throughout the entire parameter space. This
rather surprising finding of an approximate generic
analytical solution for several classes of generic
quasiperiodic models hints at the complex richness
of quasiperiodic localization. Our results are easily
verifiable in experiments using atomic gases and
optical lattices where many fine-tuned quasiperiodiclocalization models have already been studied18–21,35,36.
Quasiperiodic modulations also manifest naturally in
Moiré systems37–40where our work is also relevant.
We note that experimental systems are always finite-
size, which has significant implications on the role of
the irrational frequency β. In the Appendix, we show
examples where β=L/Qwhere QandLare coprime
numbers and Lis the system size. Our ansatz does
not hold if Qis too close to L, i.e., the system is
mathematically aperiodic, but the electron has to travel
a long distance to register this property. This is also the
intuition behind the breakdown of localization in the AA
model for V>2and almost-rational Liouville-number
frequency.

A. Numerical results for almost-periodic finite-size
systems
In this appendix, we provide extra data on the finite-
size effect on our ansatz. In the main text, we fix the
system size to be a Fibonacci number Fmso that we
can simulate an aperiodic system by choosing β=Fm/Q
where QandFmare coprime numbers and Q>Fm. If
we choose Qto be the following Fibonacci number Fm+1,
βapproximates the golden ratio that we use in the main
text, and our ansatz agrees well with the numerical result
shown in Fig. 7(a). For Qclose to Fm[Fig. 7(c-d)], the
supposedlylocalizedregimebecomesdelocalizedwiththe
scaling exponent Γbeing either fractional ( 0<Γ<1)
or close to unity. Therefore, our ansatz breaks down
if the system’s finite size is insufficient to resolve the
quasiperiodicity.
