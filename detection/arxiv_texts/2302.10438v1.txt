Abstract
We investigate the retention force factor of sessile droplets of pure (ethanol) and
binary (water-ethanol) uids laden with alumina nanoparticles placed on a critically
inclined substrate. It is observed that while the critical angle of an ethanol droplet
increases with an increase in nanoparticles concentration, for water-ethanol binary
droplets, it reaches to plateau and decreases slightly after 0.6 wt.% nanoparticle load-
ing. The eect of composition and concentration of nanoparticles on the retention
force factor is studied, and correlations are proposed for the retention force factor and
critical angle for pure and binary droplets. Infrared images of evaporating droplets
of pure and binary uids reveal richer hydrothermal waves in droplets with nanopar-
ticles loading than in droplets without loading, and these waves are more intense in
pure ethanol droplets. On an inclined substrate, the body force caused the droplets to
1arXiv:2302.10438v1  [physics.flu-dyn]  21 Feb 2023elongate more toward the receding side, which led to an earlier breakup of the droplet
at the receding side. To the best of our knowledge, our study is a rst attempt to
investigate the retention force factor for the droplets loaded with nanoparticles on an
inclined substrate.

1. Introduction
Evaporation of droplets is fascinating from a scientic and practical applications perspec-
tive due to its relevance in a wide range of applications, such as inkjet printing,1{7coating
technology,8combustion, hot-spot cooling, agriculture and microuidics,9to name a few.
In addition to the above-mentioned applications, droplet evaporation has applications in
biological systems like fabrication of DNA microarrays,10,11determining the lifetime of res-
piratory droplets12and disease detection.13{15The addition of nanoparticles to the base
uid (also called \nanouids") boosts the thermal conductivity and heat transfer rate. A
nano-uid droplet exhibits the \coee-ring" eect due to the deposition of nanoparticles near
the contact line of the droplet. To examine the interesting physics, some researchers have
examined the evaporation of droplets containing nanoparticles on horizontal substrates16{21
and inclined substrates.22{24The stability and retention force factor of pure uid droplets on
inclined substrates have also been investigated.25,26To the best of our knowledge, however,
this is the rst time we are reporting the droplet stability for pure uid and binary uid
containing nanoparticles on inclined substrates.
First, we review the research on pure (single-component) droplets. Janardan and Pan-
chagulla27studied the shape of a sessile droplet on an inclined hysteretic substrate. The
moving and sliding angles were calculated for dierent surfaces. They found that while the
loss of global equilibrium and the onset of motion induces the sliding angle, the loss of local
2equilibrium causes the moving angle. The Bond number and the initial static contact an-
gle were used to establish correlations between advancing and receding angles. The critical
sliding angle and the sliding resistance of the droplet on a grooved surface were calculated
by Ding et al.28The geometric variations of a rolling droplet for dierent droplet sizes were
investigated by Yilbas et al.29They found that increasing the droplet size increases the drag,
shear, and adhesion forces along the contact line. A scaling law was used to describe the
dependency of sliding velocity on the inclination angle, and droplet volume.30Droplet shape
and wetting behaviour have been predicted for various inclination angles, and the critical
inclination angle was found to be a function of droplet size.31,32The relationship between
surface-tension forces and contact-angle hysteresis was also estimated using the retentive-
force factor ( k).25They found that the aspect ratio of a droplet has a negligible eect on the
retention force. In both axisymmetric and asymmetric droplets, the initial width is almost
constant for the same droplet volume, resulting in a steadily increasing kwith tilting.33For
any solid/liquid combination and droplets with various shapes, a theory has been developed
to calculate the retention force factor.26,34It was found that the retention force factor values
for pure droplets range from 1 to 3.14.25
The majority of research on pure sessile droplets containing colloidal particles focused
on the mechanism underlying deposition patterns. The sessile droplet dispersed with col-
loids produces a coee-ring eect, whereas coee-eyes are observed in the case of pendent
droplets.23This is because the bulk ow advection in a pendant drop is directed toward
the contact line, whereas interface-mediated transport is directed toward the apex of the
drop. Gravity aects both the suspended particles and the droplet when it is placed on
an inclined substrate, disrupting the symmetry of the particle deposition. The main causes
of this asymmetric deposition include gravitational sedimentation, particle movement over
the asymmetrically curved liquid-air interface, and droplet splitting at the very end of the
evaporation process. Li et al.22investigated the impact of gravity on the deposition pattern
of sessile and pendant droplets with sub-micron and micro-size particles. The morphology
3of particle deposition is governed by gravitational sedimentation, interfacial shrinkage, and
outward capillary ow. The competition between gravitational sedimentation and interface
shrinkage in the rst stage decides whether the liquid-air interface can trap the particles.
The second stage involves the capillary ow, which moves the particles towards the edge.
The evaporation and wetting dynamics of binary uid droplets on horizontal and in-
clined surfaces were also studied by a few researchers.35{40Yonemoto et al.41investigated
the critical angle of inclination of the substrate as a function of surface energy density on
a low-surface-energy solid for a water-ethanol binary mixture. The relationship between
adhesion and gravitational force was analysed using a model with a particular contact area.
According to Edwards et al.,42Gravitational force predominates the ow in the evapora-
tion of microlitre-sized droplets. An equation which describes the motion of droplets due
to gravitational, capillary, and Marangoni stresses resulting from the dependence of surface
tension on local temperature was developed using lubrication theory on a heated inclined
substrate. Mamalis et al.43considered a self-rewetting mixture of a binary uid droplet and
visualised the thermal patterns on the droplet placed on a heated inclined substrate. The
presence of unique temperature patterns on evaporating droplets indicates the existence of
thermocapillary/solutal eects owing to the internal ows. The interaction of the Marangoni
stresses produced by the contact line caused it to move in the opposite direction to gravity.
A few researchers have also investigated the binary component droplets laden with
nanoparticles. The evaporation of a binary uid droplet of water and ethanol laden with
graphite nanoparticles was investigated by Zhong, and Duan.18It was observed that the
evaporation behaviour deviates from the constant evaporation rate because the droplet con-
taining more nanoparticles and ethanol evaporates more quickly. Increasing the concentration
of nanoparticles increases the rate of evaporation. The droplet containing graphite nanopar-
ticles has a higher pinning eect and a higher initial contact angle throughout the drying
process than a pure water droplet. Three dierent ow regimes were observed during the
evaporation process.19The nal deposition pattern was found to be the result of the relative
4weightings of stage 1 (when the nanoparticles migrate to the contact line) and stage 2 (when
the Marangoni ow drives the nanoparticles to move inward). This behaviour is reinforced
with an increasing load of ethanol. Parsa et al.20employed infrared thermography and opti-
cal microscopy to observe the three distinct ow patterns for water-ethanol binary droplets
laden with copper oxide (CuO) at dierent substrate temperatures. On a non-heated sub-
strate, a uniform deposition pattern was seen. However, on a heated substrate, dual rings
and stick-slip were observed. The dynamics of the droplet as it evaporates were found to be
similar to a water-butanol droplet without nanoparticles. As the gradient of surface tension
decreases, convection currents and the chaotic motion of nanoparticles are also reduced. At
room temperature, the dierence in evaporation rate between a droplet containing a nanopar-
ticle and one without nanoparticles is higher and diminishes as the substrate temperature
rises. Katre et al.44investigated the evaporation dynamics of a water-ethanol binary mix-
ture with alumina nanoparticles at dierent substrate temperatures. They observed that the
droplet containing 0.6 wt.% loading is pinned for most of its lifetime, whereas the wetting
diameter of the droplet without loading decreases monotonically. The infrared images reveal
that a droplet with nanouid loading exhibits signicantly richer thermal patterns than a
droplet without nanoparticle loading. The droplet with nanoparticle loading shows vigorous
mixing and a faster evaporation rate due to its pinning eect as well as thermo-capillary
and thermo-solutal convection. The deposition pattern after the complete droplet evapo-
ration shows that the nanoparticles were deposited near the triplet contact line, indicating
the coee ring eect. This symmetry is broken when the droplet is placed on an inclined
substrate.45In this case, the deposition of particles was more signicant near the advancing
side of the droplet, and an uneven stick-slip pattern was observed on the receding side.
The aforementioned review of the literature reveals that while many researchers have
studied the evaporation dynamics, shapes, and deposition patterns of pure and binary
droplets with and without nanoparticles, only a few studies have discussed the stability
and retention force factor of droplets on an inclined substrate; albeit only for pure uids and
5without nanoparticles. The droplet parameters and retention force play an important role in
studying droplet stability at a critical inclination angle. In the present study, we investigate
the stability and retention force factor for pure ethanol (E 100% + W 0%) and ethanol (E)
and water (W) binary uid droplets with alumina (Al 2O3) nanoparticles of varying con-
centrations (wt.%). In the present study, for binary uid, we choose (E 80% + W 20%)
composition based on our earlier investigations44,45for dierent compositions that show rich
convection patterns for the (E 80% + W 20%) droplet. The correlations for the retention
force factor and critical angle for pure and binary droplets are proposed. We also discuss the
thermal patterns of the evaporating droplets by performing infrared thermography. The rest
of the paper is organised as follows. The experimental setup and post-processing method
are described in section 2. The results obtained from our experiments and the proposed
correlations are discussed in section 3. Finally, we conclude the study in section 4.
2. Experimental Methodology
2.1 Experimental set-up
The evaporation of sessile droplets of pure ethanol (E 100% + W 0%) and binary mixture (E
80% + W 20%) loaded with dierent concentrations (wt.%) of alumina nanoparticles has
been investigated using shadowgraphy and infrared (IR) imaging techniques. The experi-
mental setup is shown schematically in gure 1. We use a customised goniometer (Make:
Holmarc Opto-Mechatronic) for our experiments. It consists of a motorised pump with a
syringe which produces droplets of required volume, a multilayer metal block, a proportional-
integral-derivative (PID) controller which maintains the substrate temperature, an infrared
(IR) camera (Make: FLIR, Model: X6540sc) and a metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
camera (Model: DS-CBY501E-H). A light source is placed opposite to CMOS camera. The
entire assembly was enclosed inside the goniometer box to minimise environmental distur-
bances from the outside. The goniometer box is maintained at 22C temperature and 50 
65% relative humidity. The relative humidity is measured using a hygrometer (Make: HTC,
Model: 288-ATH) that is installed inside the goniometer box.

Figure 1: Schematic of the experimental setup (customized goniometer). It consists of a
heater placed in a stainless steel block, an aluminium plate with PTFE tape coated in black
paint, a CMOS camera and light source arrangement and an infrared (IR) camera.
The CMOS camera records the side view of the sessile droplet at a frame rate of 10 frames
per second (fps) with a spatial resolution of 1280 960 pixels. The IR camera captured the
top view of the droplet with a spectral range of 3 m 5m, which displays the temperature
prole on the liquid-air interface of the droplet. The thermal images are recorded at 50 fps
with a spatial resolution of 640 512 pixels. The multilayer block consists of two electrical
heaters controlled by a PID controller embedded in a stainless steel foundation and an
aluminium plate of size 100 mm 80 mm15 mm painted with black paint to minimise
reection in the infrared imaging system. We use a PTFE (polytetrauoroethylene) tape
having a thickness of 100 m as the substrate which is applied on a black painted aluminium
plate. The stability of the PTFE tape is veried for the temperature range examined in
this work. The roughness of the PTFE substrate measured using a digital microscope is
7found to be in between 4.74 and 18.16 m.45Prior to each experiment, the PTFE tape is
cleaned with an isopropanol solution, dried using compressed air, and then placed on the
metal plate. The substrate is maintained at a temperature Ts= 50C and is checked using
a K-type thermocouple before placing the droplet on the substrate. To prepare the binary
solution of (E 80% + W 20%), deionized water and absolute ethanol (99.9% purity) are
mixed with a stirrer to create a homogeneous mixture on a volume basis. The nanoparticles
are then added by weight percentage (wt.%). In our experiments, we use alumina (Al 2O3)
nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 20{30 nm purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories
Pvt. Ltd. to prepare a mixture of various compositions laden with nanoparticles. To ensure
homogeneous distribution in the solution, the mixture is ultrasonically treated for an hour
(Make: BRANSONIC, CPX1800H-E). A motorised pump that regulates the volume ow
rate was connected to a chromatographic syringe with a capacity of 100 m and a piston 8
size of 1.58 mm from Unitek Scientic Corporation. The syringe is tted with a 21G needle
with an aperture diameter of 0.51 mm which produces droplets with consistent size.
Pure and binary droplets of volume (3 0:3)l loaded with dierent nanoparticle con-
centrations are placed on a critically inclined substrate. The critical angle ( ) of inclination
is the angle above which a droplet started to slide. It is to be noted that depends on the
composition of the uid and the concentration of the nanoparticle. To nd out the critical
angle at a given condition, experiments are conducted with an initial inclination angle of 15
and with an increment of 5until the droplet started to slide down at a particular angle. To
get the exact value of the critical angle, an increment of 2is then used between the angles
where the droplet slide and does not slide.
2.2 Post-processing
The side view obtained from the CMOS camera is processed using an in-house developed
Matlabrprogram. The gradient is improved by utilising an unsharp masking approach
to sharpen the image and a median ltering technique to remove random noise. After
8being ltered, the image is transformed into a binary image using an appropriate threshold
that distinguishes the droplet boundary from the surrounding area. The reection due
to light is then eliminated, and the droplet contour was traced using a Matlabrtool.
The detailed post-processing method can be found in our previous study.46To process the
infrared images, the droplet contour is extracted using the U-net machine learning model
as discussed in our previous work.44It is usual to practice edge detection and intensity
thresholding to separate the droplet contour from the background. Additionally, the U-net
architecture uses data augmentation by elastically deforming the annotated input photos,
which enables the network to make greater use of the available annotated images. The U-net-
based machine learning model only requires a few annotated images. Therefore a total of 40
manually annotated grey-scale infrared images are used to train the network on a computer
with a GPU (NVIDIA Quadro P1000). The network extracts the binary masks and droplet
boundaries from the infrared images. Finally, the background is removed using a Matlabr
function, and the thermal proles of the evaporating droplets are analysed.
3. Results and discussion
We investigate the droplet stability and retention force factor of pure ethanol (E 100% + W
0%) and binary (E 80% + W 20%) sessile droplets with and without Al 2O3nanoparticles
loading at the onset of sliding. The substrate temperature is maintained at 50C. The
concentration of nanoparticles (in wt.%) in the solution is varied from 0 wt.% to 1 wt.%,
and its eect on the retention force factor is studied.
A sessile droplet starts to slide when the inclination angle exceeds the critical angle, while
the surface tension force allows the droplet to stick to the inclined or vertical substrate.
The two forces that act on a sessile droplet placed on an inclined substrate are (i) surface
tension force ( Fs) and (ii) gravitational force. On a critically inclined surface, Fs=mgsin
(which is the tangential component of gravitational force). When the droplet is placed on an
9inclined substrate, the front edge of the drop moves forward, whereas the rear edge remains
xed. As this happens, the advancing angle increases, and the receding angle decreases.
Figure 2 shows the dierent proles of an (E 80% + W 20%) droplet loaded with 0.6 wt.%
nanoparticles with changing inclination angles of the substrate. It can be seen that when
the droplet is placed at a lower inclination angle ( = 201) than its critical angle, the
surface tension force dominates the gravitational force, and the droplet is stable (gure 2a).
Figure 2b depicts a droplet placed at its critical angle ( = 351). The critical angle
corresponds to the situation when the surface tension and gravitation forces balance each
other. A further increase in the inclination angle causes the droplet to slide. Figure 2c shows
a droplet placed above its critical inclination angle, and the blue dashed lines show proles
of the sliding droplet. In this case, the droplet starts to slide as a parallel component of
gravity (mgsin) overcomes the surface tension force. The critically inclined droplets having
non-spherical contours create an eective surface tension force upward along the inclination,
counteracting the gravitational force component. Because of this, it is simple to calculate the
upward component of the surface tension force using the contact angle hysteresis data. The
relationship between surface tension force ( Fs) holding a droplet on a solid substrate and
the contact angles is given by25

advancing ( A) and receding contact angles ( R) of a droplet are depicted in supplementary
gure S1. The values of AandRfor (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%) droplets
placed at their respective critical angles for dierent values of nanoparticle loading (wt.%) are
presented in supplementary table ST1. In the present study, due to the non-spherical contour
of the droplet, Ris calculated as ( D1+D2)=2, whereinD1andD2are the diameters of the
10droplet along and across the inclination direction, respectively. In Eq. (1), kis a constant
called as retention force factor. It is to be noted that kdepends on the droplet geometry.26
For pure uid droplets, the retention force factor is between 1 and 3.14.25However, no
one has yet reported the retention force factor for binary-nanouid droplets, which is the
objective of the present work. Thus it is possible to directly evaluate the force required to
cause any droplet to move with any contact angle hysteresis if the values of Randkare
known. We have restricted our investigation in the present study to Newtonian uids only.
Other classes of uids may exhibit a dierent retention force factor.

(a droplet that starts to slide). In panel (c), the dashed lines represent the proles of the
sliding droplet.
In the present study, we investigate the eect of dierent parameters like concentration
of nanoparticles (in wt.%) and composition on kvalues for sessile droplets placed on their
respective critically inclined substrates. Supplementary table ST2 presents the critical angle
values for dierent wt.% of nanoparticle for (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%)
droplets. It is observed that the critical angle of the (E 100% + W 0%) droplet is less
than the (E 80% + W 20%) droplet for no loading (0 wt.%) condition as water has a higher
surface tension than ethanol. The critical angle increases with an increase in the nanoparticle
wt.% for the (E 100% + W 0%) droplet because the surface tension of the droplet increases
with the addition of nanoparticles47and the upward component of this surface tension force
can balance with the downward gravitational component even at higher inclination angles.
11However, in the case of the (E 80% + W 20%) droplet, the critical angle reaches a plateau
value at about 0.6 wt.% loading and even decreases with a further increase in nanoparticle
wt.%. This may be because the further addition of nanoparticles increases the weight of the
droplet, which leads to an increase in the downward component of gravity. This is not fully
compensated by the increase in the surface tension force due to the addition of nanoparticles.
This does not apply to the (E 100% + W 0%) droplet as the (E 80% + W 20%) droplet has
a higher weight due to the presence of water (which is heavier than ethanol).
3.1 Droplet prole: side view
Figure 3: Side-view of (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%) droplets with 0.6 wt.%
nanoparticle loading placed on a substrate inclined at the corresponding critical inclination
angle. The values of the critical angle ( ) are included at the top-right corner of each panel.
This section analyses the initial side view proles of (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% +
12W 20%) droplets laden with dierent loading conditions (wt.%) placed at their respective
critical angles (gure3). The initial volume of the droplet was maintained practically constant
by performing many repetitions. In gure3, RandAindicate the receding and advancing
side, respectively. As more liquid is shifted toward the advancing side due to body force, the
contact angle on the advancing side is greater than the receding side for all cases. Due to
its lower surface tension, the (E 100% + W 0%) droplet spreads more than the (E 80% +
W 20%) droplet and exhibits lower contact angle values. It can be seen that (E 100% + W
0%) droplets exhibit similar proles for small nanoparticle loadings (wt.% 0:6). However,
a noticeable dierence is observed in the proles of droplets containing 0.8 wt.% and 1.0
wt.%. The spread of the droplet with 0.8 wt.% loading is higher and exhibits lower contact
angles than that of the droplet with 1.0 wt.% loading. This may be because a droplet with
1.0 wt.% loading deposits more nanoparticles near the triple contact line than a droplet with
0.8 wt.% loading. Similar behavior is shown for the (E 80% + W 20%) droplet with 1.0
wt.%, which exhibits a smaller spread compensated by higher height and contact angles. To
illustrate this behaviour, in gure 4(a) and (b), the superimposed contours proles of the
droplets with dierent wt.% of nanoparticles loading are plotted for (E 100% + W 0%) and
(E 80% + W 20%) droplets, respectively. Here, the substrate is maintained at 50C.

droplets, respectively.
The values of critical angle correspond to (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%)
droplets for dierent loadings (wt.%) are presented graphically in gure 5(a) (also see, table
13ST2 of the supplementary material). It can be seen that, for both (E 100% + W 0%) and
(E 80% + W 20%) droplets, increasing the nanoparticles loading (wt.%) up to 0.6 wt.%
monotonically increases the critical angle ( ). Then the behaviour diverges for the two
cases. For (E 80% + W 20%) droplet, the critical angle is highest for 0.6 wt.% and starts an
appreciable decline up to 1 wt.% loading. On the other hand, for (E 100% + W 0%) droplet,
the critical angle nearly stabilises after 0.6 wt.%. The variations of the Bond number, Bo,
that signies the competition between the eective body force acting on the droplet with
the surface tension force as dened in Eq. (2) with nanoparticle loading (wt.%) for (E 100%
+ W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%) droplets are presented in gure 5(b).

Here,fandnare the densities of the base uid and base uid laden with nanoparticles,

temperature is taken from the literature.48Previous studies have shown that the surface
tension of liquids with tiny quantities of nanoparticles does not signicantly deviate from
the value of the surface tension of pure liquids.49
Figure 5b shows that for the (E 100% + W 0%) droplet, the Bond number increases with
an increase in nanoparticle wt.% up to 0.8 wt.% and then declines. In Eq. (2), it can be
observed that the Bond number is directly proportional to sin ,R2andeff. Thus, it can
be inferred that the increase in the Bond number up to 0.8 wt.% is caused by the rise in the
critical angle and effof the droplet. It can be seen that for 1.0 wt.%, there is a rise in the
14critical angle by 1. The inuence of R2prevails on the Bond number since Ris lower for
1.0 wt.% than for 0.8 wt.% (see, gure 3), causing a decrease in the Bond number. For (E
80% + W 20%) droplet, the Bond number rises till 0.6 wt.%, decreases for 0.8 wt.%, and
then slightly rises for 1.0 wt.%. The value of the Bond number changes when we increase the
nanoparticle loading because of an increase in the eective density and change in the critical
angle of the droplet. The rate of increase or decrease of Bond number won't track the change
in critical angle exactly. When the change in critical angle is modest, the wt.% also plays a
role. When wt.% changes from 0.6 wt.% to 0.8 wt.%, there is a decrease in the critical angle
by 5, and the Bond number also decreases. However, the critical angle changes a little (1)
from 0.8 wt.% to 1.0 wt.%. As a result, the rise in the nanoparticles loading also comes into
play, and we notice a slight divergence in the response of the Bond number.

thus conrms that there is a linear relationship between the advancing and receding contact
angles. It is possible to generalize the relationship between the advancing and receding con-
tact angles for binary and nanouid droplets since our experimental results are consistent
with the range shown in gure 6. For the generalised relationship, if Ais specied, then R

and receding angles obtained from our experiments for (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W
20%) droplets (indicated by the red and green symbols) lie within this range. It is to be noted
that our results and earlier experiments have shown that the data is noisy, but the spread of
our results falls within the range of those earlier studies. Although the earlier experimental
results involved pure uids on unheated substrates, the current work involves pure ethanol
and ethanol-water binary mixture on a heated substrate with nanoparticle loadings. We infer
that the correlations given by ElSherbini and Jacobi and linear t ( R= 11:5 + 0:9A) are
reasonably robust for binary droplets and other types of substrate conditions. Despite our
16limited experimental data, we anticipate that our results will contribute to an eventual gen-
eralisation that can explain all experimental results for various droplet types and substrate
conditions.

andCis the nanoparticle concentration in wt.%. It is to be noted that the initial volume of

multiplykby the volume correction factor Vm=V. The modied retention force factor, K,
is plotted against the normalized critical inclination angle (i.e. the critical angle normalized
with the critical angle of no loading case). The results for (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80%
+ W 20%) droplets are tted by quadratic t with a correlation coecient of 0.99 and 0.83,
respectively. The equations for quadratic ts are given by
For (E 100% + W 0%) droplets:
= 0= 1 + 1:2K 0:35K2; (8)
and for (E 80% + W 20%) droplets:
= 0= 1 + 1:2K 0:61K2: (9)
The constants and linear terms in Eqs. (8) and (9) are the same for both (E 100% + W
0%) and (E 80% + W 20%) droplets. For droplets with no nanoparticle loading, Cis zero, and
consequently, Kbecomes zero from its denition mentioned above. The proposed correlation
focuses on the change in a droplet's critical angle driven by the addition of nanoparticles
in comparison to the no-loading condition. The linear term represents the increase in the
critical angle due to an increase in friction and surface tension caused by the addition of
19the nanoparticles. The expressions show that for lower loading wt.%, the eect of adding
nanoparticles is the same for both compositions since the linear term has the same constant
for both droplets. On the other hand, the quadratic term is negative and decreases the critical
angle with increasing nanoparticle loading. This term comes in due to the increase in weight
of the nanouid due to the addition of nanoparticles that increases the gravitational force
component. Thus this term becomes important only at higher wt.% of nanoparticle loading.
The constant associated with this quadratic term is also dierent for pure and binary uids.
This is likely because the balance between surface tension and gravitational forces diers for
critically inclined droplets of dierent compositions. The coecient of K2for pure uid (E
100% + W 0%) ( a1) and binary uid (E 80% + W 20%) ( a2) are related as a2= 1:74a1. The
Kvalues are inuenced by the inclination, composition of the mixture, and concentration
of the nanoparticles added, as shown in gure 8. The value of Kfor (E 100% + W 0%)
droplet increases with increasing inclination angle and nanoparticle concentration. For (E
80% + W 20%) droplet, the value of Kincreases initially up to 0.6 wt.% as the critical angle
increases. After 0.6 wt.%, a slight decrease in the critical angle is observed despite this value
ofKincreases as other terms in Eq. 5 like (cos R cosA) andmdominate.
3.4 Evaporation dynamics: thermal proles
In this section, we discuss the thermal patterns of the evaporating sessile droplets of (E 100%
+ W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%) compositions laden with dierent nanoparticle loadings.
The substrate is maintained at Ts= 50and inclined at the respective critical angle of
dierent droplets. Figure 9 shows the temporal variations of the temperature contours of an
(E 100% + W 0%) droplet with no loading, 0.4 wt.%, and 0.8 wt.% loadings. Here, t=teis
the normalized time, wherein teis the lifetime of the droplet and t= 0 represents the instant
when the droplet is placed on the substrate. It can be observed that the wetting diameter
of the (E 100% + W 0%) droplet without nanoparticle loading shrinks (i.e the wetting
diameter decreases with time) whereas the droplet with loading shows a pinned behavior for

the majority of its lifetime. In the loading condition, we observe more hydrothermal waves
and instabilities since the droplet is pinning and the addition of nanoparticles accelerates
the evaporation process. This demonstrates that in droplets laden with nanoparticles, the
thermocapillary forces due to the surface tension gradients produce more vigorous Marangoni
convection. The dierences in the surface tension brought on by the temperature gradients
cause the interfacial waves to move from warmer (lower surface tension) to colder (higher
surface tension) zones. As a result of these actions, the droplet tends to spread along the
direction of inclination. We observe more elongation of the droplet in the case of 0.8 wt.%
than 0.4 wt.% case due to its higher critical angle of inclination. This resulted in an earlier
breakdown of the droplet at the receding side as more uid volume shifted to the advancing
side.

pure ethanol droplet shown in gure 9, the (E 80% + W 20%) droplet with nanoparticles
loadings also shows a pinned nature whereas no loading droplet shrinks as its wetting di-
ameter decreases with time (gure 10). For this composition, due to the small dierence in
the critical angle values between 0.4 wt.% and 0.8 wt.%, no signicant variation is observed
in the thermal patterns. The hydrothermal waves and instability are less intense in an (E

4. Conclusions
The droplet stability in terms of the retention force factor at their respective critical angles
is studied for pure ethanol (E 100% + W 0%) and binary (E 80% + W 20%) sessile droplets
22laden with alumina (Al 2O3) nanoparticles. Shadowgraphy and infrared imaging techniques
are employed to investigate the dynamics, and experiments are conducted in a customized
goniometer. The images are post-processed using Matlabrand U-net architecture based
on a convolution neural network (machine learning technique). It is observed that the critical
angle of inclination increases with an increase in nanoparticle loading (wt.%) for (E 100%
+ W 0%) droplets. However, for (E 80% + W 20%) droplets, the critical angle decreases
slightly after 0.6 wt.% as the gravitational force dominates the surface tension force. With
the increase in the critical angle of inclination, the Bond number also increases. The values
of advancing and receding angles from dierent sources show that the relationship between
the advancing and receding contact angles can be generalized for a given range. Our exper-
imental advancing and receding contact angle values fall under this range. A quadratic t
with R2value of 0.84 ts the relationship between the ratio of the advancing to receding
contact angles and the Bond number for both (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%)
droplets. The retention force factor is calculated for dierent nanoparticle loadings for pure
and binary uid droplets. The droplet composition, nanoparticles loading, and the critical
angle of inclination aect the retention force factor. For (E 100% + W 0%) droplets, the
retention force factor increases with an increase in nanoparticle loading and the critical in-
clination angle. The data are tted by a quadratic t and the correlation for retention force
factor and the critical angle between (E 100% + W 0%) and (E 80% + W 20%) droplets is
found. Infrared images of the evaporating droplets are presented for dierent loading con-
ditions. The droplets with nanoparticle loading show richer hydrothermal waves than the
droplets without loading, and these waves are more intense in droplets with higher ethanol
concentration. The droplets elongated more towards the receding side due to body force,
resulting in an earlier breakdown of the droplet at the receding side.
