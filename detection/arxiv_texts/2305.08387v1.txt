  Wigner crystal s are predicted as the crystallization  of the dilute electron gas moving  in a 
uniform background  when the electron -electron  Coulomb energy dominates the kinet ic 
energy1. The Wigner c rystal has previously been observed in the ultraclean two -dimensional 
electron gas (2DEG) present on the surface of liquid helium2,3 and in semiconductor quantum 
wells at high magnetic field4,5. More recently, Wigner crystals have also been reported in  
WS 2/WSe 2 moiré  heterostructures6–8. ABC -stacked trilayer graphene on boron nitride (ABC -
TLG/hBN) moiré superlattice s provi de a un ique tunable  platform to explore Wigner crystal 
states where the electron correlation can be controlled by electric and magnetic field. Here we 
report  the observation of magnetic field stabilized  Wigner crystal states in a ABC -TLG/hBN 
moiré  superlat tice. We show that  correlated insulating states  emerge at multiple fractional 
and integer fillings corresponding to   = 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 5/3 and 2  electrons per  moiré  lattice 
site under a magnetic field . These correlated insulating states can be attribute d to generalized  
Mott states for the integer fillings  ( = 1, 2)  and generalized  Wigner crystal states  for the 
fractional fillings  ( = 1/3, 2/3, 4/3, 5/3) . The generalized Wigner crystal states are stabilized 
by a vertical magnetic field, and they are str ongest at one magnetic flux quantum per three 
moiré superlattice s. The correlated insulating states at  = 2 persists up to 30 Tesla, whic h can 
be described by a  Mott -Hofstadter transition  at high magnetic field . The tunable  Mott and 
Wigner crystal states in the ABC -TLG/hBN highlight the  opportunities to discover new 
correlated quantum phases due to the interplay between the magnetic field and moiré  
flatbands .

  Moiré superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures are emerging as  a powerful 
platform for e xploring novel correlated electron physics , where the  moiré  band widths 
can be made small enough that electron correlations dominate9,10. The ABC -stacked 
trilayer graphene on hBN  (ABC -TLG/hBN ) moiré  heterostructure provide s a 
remarkably tunable  system to explore the  interplay betwe en electron -electron 
interactions,  the moiré  flatband bandwidth , and the moiré  band topology , where  Mott 
insulator, superconductor, Chern insulator, and fractional -filling orbital ferromagnet  
phases can all be realized in a single device through electr ical control11–14. The magnetic 
field provides another dimension to manipulate correlated quantum phases in moiré  
heterostructures . Fascinating  Hofstadter butterfly states have been previously observed 
in highly dispersive monolayer graphene/h BN moiré  superlattices  in high magnetic 
field when the cyclotron orbit  size is comparable to the moiré period15–18. In ABC -
TLG/hBN  moiré  superlattice, we have the combination of a magnetic field with  a 
topological and flat moiré  minibands19,20. It can lead to new tunable quantum phases 
distinctly d ifferent from the conventional Hofstadter butterfly  phenomena . 
 Here we report the observation of generalized Wigner crystal states stabilized by 
the magnetic field at fractional electron fillings in  an ABC -TLG /hBN moiré  superlattice . 
Upon applying  a perpe ndicular magnetic field  (B┴), new insulating states  emerg e at the 
electron doping  of n = n0/3, 2n0/3, n0, 4n0/3, 5n0/3 and 2n0 in the ABC -TLG/hBN moiré  
superlattice, where  n0 corresponds to one electron per moiré  site. These  insulating states 
can be understood as  generalized  Mott s tates at integer fillings ( n = n0 and 2 n0) and 
generalized  Wigner crystal states  at fractional fillings ( n = n0/3, 2n0/3, 4n0/3 and 5n0/3). 
The generalized Wigner crystal state s arise  from an unusual interplay between the 
magnetic field and the moiré  bandw idth: they require both a  sufficiently flat moiré 
miniband at large vertical displacement field D and a perpendicular B┴ close to  6 Tesla. 
The Mott insulating  state at  n = 2n0, however, does not have a strong B┴ field 
dependence. It persists up to 30 Tesla , which  can be understood as  the Hofstadter 
butterfly state  in the high magnetic field . 
 Figure 1a shows a schematic of  our ABC -TLG/hBN heterostructure device, which  4 / 19 
 is the same sample as in Ref 13. The  ABC -TLG is aligned with the bottom hBN crystal 
with zero twisted angle . The  moiré superlattice period is  15 nm. Gate voltages Vt and 
Vb separately applied to the metal top gate and the Si bottom gate  allow  us to 
independently control the doping  n and the miniband bandwidth tuned by the vertical 
electric field D following the relations : 𝑛=(𝐷𝑏−𝐷𝑡)/𝑒, and 𝐷=(𝐷𝑏+𝐷𝑡)/2.21 
Here 𝐷𝑏=+𝜀𝑏(𝑉𝑏−𝑉𝑏0)/𝑑𝑏 and 𝐷𝑡=−𝜀𝑡(𝑉𝑡−𝑉𝑡0)/𝑑𝑡 are the vertical 
displacement field below and above the ABC -TLG/hBN, respectively, 𝜀𝑏(𝑡) and 𝑑𝑏(𝑡) 
are the dielectric constant and thickness of  the bottom (top) dielectric layers, and 𝑉𝑏(𝑡)0 
is the effective offset in the bottom (top) gate voltages caused by environment -induced 
carrier doping.  Figure 1b shows the calculated single -particle bandstructure for ABC -
TLG/hBN  at B┴ = 0 and D = 0.5 V/nm .13 The lowest valance  miniband tend to have 
narrower bandwidth and therefore stronger correlation effec ts than the lowest 
conduction  miniband at zero magnetic field.  
 Figure 1c shows the experimental data of the longitudinal  resistivity  xx in the    
ABC -TLG/hBN moiré  superlattice  as a function of n and D. Resistivity peaks at n = 0 
and n = ±4n0 correspond to charge neutrality point and fully filled points of conduction 
and valence single -particle minibands, respectively. Correlated insulator states can be 
clearly observed at hole doping of  n = -n0 and n = -2n0 when the disp lacement field | D| 
is large r than ~ 0.2 V/nm. For electron doping , the correlated insulator state appears at 
n = 2n0 only w hen D is more negative than  -0.6 V/nm . The large electron -hole 
asymmetry can be accounted for by the flatter valence  moiré  miniband  at zero magnetic 
field, as shown in  Fig. 1b. In the same ABC -TLG/hBN moiré  heterostructure,  
signatures of superconductivity  has been  observed near n = -n0 at large positive D,12 
and a C = 2 Chern insulator has been  observed at n = -n0 with a topological flat moiré  
miniban d at negative D.13 
 The correla ted elect ron phenomena change dramatically under a perpendicular 
magnetic field B┴. Figure 2a shows the magneto -transport data of  xx as functions of n 
and B┴ at D = -0.4V/nm  where one expects the bands to be topologically non -trivial .  5 / 19 
 The correlated insulator states in the valence  moiré  miniband  (n < 0) are destabilized 
for B┴ > 4 T. Simultaneously , electron correlation becomes stronger at finite B┴ for the 
conduction moiré mini band  (n > 0). First , two prominent xx peaks appear  at the integer 
fillings of n = n0 and 2 n0 for B┴ > 3 T,  corresponding to one and two electrons per moiré 
site, respectively.  Then , multiple resistivity peaks at fractional fillings of n0/3, 2n0/3, 
4n0/3 and 5 n0/3 of the conduction minibands , corresponding to 1, 2, 4 and 5 electrons 
per three  moiré sites,  emerge  at B┴ between 5 to 8 Tesla . 
 These magnetic field s tabilized insulating states exhibit several notable features. 
First, all the resistivity  peak s occur at near constant filling s and their positions  are 
largely independent on the  magnetic field . This behavior is distinctly different from  
quantized Landau le vels, where the carrier density  in a Landau level scales linearly with 
B┴.22 Second, the xx peaks  at fillings from n0/3 to 5 n0/3 are maximum near B┴ = 5.5 T , 
as shown in Fig. 2b . This magnetic field corresponds to a magnetic flux Φ=𝐵┴∙𝐴=
0.78Φ0 through  three moiré  lattice area, where  Φ0=ℎ/𝑒 is the magnetic flux 
quantum.  Third, the resistivity  peaks within  the conduction band  appear with the 
application of  an out-of-plane magnetic field B┴, but not an  in-plane magnetic field B// 
(see Fig. S 1 for B// data).  
 These magnetic -field stabilized insulating states observed  at integer and fractional 
fillings  are tunable by the displacement field D, which  controls the  bandwidth of the 
moiré  minibands  in ABC -TLG/hBN. Figure 2c shows the evolution of xx as a function 
of the displacement field D for a fixed B┴ = 5.5 T. The resistivity  peaks  first appear at 
D ~ - 0.2 V/nm, and become increasingly prominent wi th increasing the amplitude of 
D at fixed B┴ = 5.5 T.  At the highest D field, even  more insulating states beyond the 
n/3 fillings start to emerge . Figure 2d shows  normalized  xx as a function of D at integer 
and fractional f illings . These B┴ stabilized ins ulating states exhibit similar  xx 
dependence on the D field compared with that  of the Mott insulating states of the 
valence band at zero magnetic field11. It suggests that the B┴ stabilized insulating states 
in the conduction moiré  minibands are also correlated insulators controlled by  6 / 19 
 dominating electron -electron interactions  when the moiré  miniband becomes 
sufficiently flat.   
 The B┴ stabilized insulating states  are only observ ed with a negative D, not positive 
D, in the ABC -TLG/hBN moiré  device. (See Fig. S2 for the comparison of the magneto 
transport at positive and negative D.) The asymmetry of the D dependence originates 
from the fact that  the moiré superlattice only exists between ABC -TLG and the bottom 
hBN. Figure S3b and c display the calculated LL fan for electron and hole doping  in 
our structure. The theory predicts that  the crossing LLs due to Hofstadter butterfly only 
exists in the electron side for D < 0 and in hole s ide for D > 0.  
 Figure 3a plots the n dependent xx curves at different temperatures for fixed D = 
-0.4 V/nm and B┴ = 5.5 T. The resistivity  peaks show clear insulating beh avior with 
increased resistivity at lower temperatures. The Arrhenius plot s of the temperature 
dependent xx are shown  in the inset of Fig.  3a. These Arrhenius plots exhibit similar 
slopes, indicating comparable transport thermal excitation gap s ~ 6 Kelvin  for these B┴ 
stabilized insulators at both fractional and integer fillings. We not e that th is transport  
gap may not be intrinsic because the transport  behavior could be affected by  extrinsic 
effects such as impurity scattering s.  
 We attribute the observed correlated states at integer fillings of n = n0 and 2 n0 to 
generalized Mott state s and fractional fillings of n = n0/3, 2 n0/3, 4 n0/3, 5 n0/3 to 
generalized Wigner crystal states stabilized by the magnetic field.  Fig. 3b  illustrate s the 
real space electron lattice of the insulating states at the filling s of n = n0/3, 2n0/3, n0 of 
the ABC -TLG/hBN  moiré  superlattice . There is one electron per three  moiré  sites at  n 
= n0/3, where the electrons not only avoid double occupancy at the same site, but also 
avoid simultaneous  occupation of the adjacent moiré  sites. This state is known as a 
general ized Wigner crystal state. I t highlights the importance of  long-range electron  
interactions beyond the on -site Coulomb potential as typically used in the Hubbard 
model. The generalized Wigner crystal states at fractional fillings are most prominent 
when th ere is  approximately one magnetic flux quantum per Wigner crystal  lattice ( i.e. 
three times of a moiré cell) .   7 / 19 
  The integer filling state at 2n0 persists to very high magnetic field up to 30 T, as 
shown in Fig. S3a, which we attribute to the Hofstadter but terfly state. The magnetic 
field dependence of the 2n0 is very different to the other states  (Fig. 2a, b and Fig. S3a) , 
suggesting a different origin in the very high magnetic field. We calculate the 
Hofstadter butterfly states  of the ABC -TLG/hBN with the  potential difference of  ±20 
meV  between the top and  bottom graphene layers  (corresponding to D = ±0.4 V/nm, 
see Methods for calculation details ). Our calculation (within the single -particle picture) 
predicts that  LL at 2n0 with a filling factor  = 0 is de veloped at B┴ = 7 T and persists 
in the high magnetic field up to 30 T  (Fig. S3b) , which  accounts for the stability of the 
insulating state at  n = 2n0 in very high field . Therefore, the insulat ing state  at n = 2n0 is 
characterized by a correlated Mott insulator at low B┴ and a  Hofstadter butterfly 
insulator at high B┴. In comparison, no LL and Hofstadter butterfly  is predicted at n = 
n0 in the single particle calculation (Fig. S3b). The insulating state  at n = n0 is a Mott 
state that is not related to the H ofstadter  butterfly pattern . 
 Our observed Wigner crystal states are different from the quantum Hall Wigner 
crystal s observed previously . In quantum Hall Wigner crystal s, the carrier density of 
the Wigner  crystal  scales linearly with the magnetic field . Our generalized  Wigner  
crystal states, however, occur at a constant carrier density  as a function of field . The 
Wigner crystal lattice period of √3LM is locked to the moiré perio d and independent 
of the applied magnetic field. The l ocking between the  Wigne r crystal lattice and the 
moiré lattice has been  observed recently in the TMD moiré  heterostructures  probed by 
optical measurements6–8. It is interesting to compare the Wigner crystal states in these 
two moiré system s. The electron lattices of Wigner crystals in both systems are 
triangular lattices with the periods of three times of the moiré periods . The strongest  
Wigner crystal states in these two systems are generally the same  at n0/3, 2n0/3, 4n0/3 
and 5 n0/3. However,  there are some significant differences. The Wigner crystal states 
in TMD moiré  superlattices  originate from very strong e lectron -electron  interactions . It 
does not depend sensitively to the external electrical and magnetic field. The Wigner 
crystal states in  ABC -TLG/hBN moiré  superlattice, however, are highly tunable by  8 / 19 
 both the external magnetic field and the vertical electrical field. They offer an excellent 
platform to explore how different quantum phases compete and how the Wigner crystal 
states emerge at certain parameter ranges.

Calculation for  Hofstadter butterfly states . The total Hamiltonian  
𝐻=𝐻0+𝐻𝑀 
 For the purpose of Hofstadter bands, we use a  simple 2 × 2 model for the ABC -
TLG  based on  A1, B3 orbitals.  An effective model for graphene at K  valley  is 
𝐻0=(𝑓𝐴1†(𝐤),𝑓𝐵3†(𝐤))

 We have  𝜋=𝑘𝑥+𝑖𝑘𝑦, 𝑣=√3
2|𝑡|, 𝑣3=√3
2𝛾3, and 𝑣4=√3
2𝛾4, where  
(𝑡,𝛾1,𝛾2,𝛾3,𝛾4 )= (-2610, 358, -8.3, 293, 144 ) meV . The Hamiltonian at finite 
magnetic field B can be obtained by substituting  𝜋𝑥=𝑝𝑥−𝑒𝐴𝑥 and 𝜋𝑦=𝑝𝑦−𝑒𝐴𝑦. 
 The moiré superlattice potential is  
𝐻𝑀=∑(𝑉𝑒𝑖𝜑)𝑓𝐴1†(𝐤+𝑸𝑗)+ℎ.𝑐.
𝑗=1,2,3 
Where 𝑸1=(0,4𝜋
√3𝑎𝑀), 𝑸2=(−2𝜋
𝑎𝑀,2𝜋
√3𝑎𝑀), and 𝑸3=(−2𝜋
𝑎𝑀,−2𝜋
√3𝑎𝑀). We used 
𝑉= −14.88 meV  and 𝜑=−50.19°.  
 In the calculation, for a given magnetic flux, we first solve 𝐻0 and get  degenerate 
Landau levels. Then we project  𝐻𝑀 term in the Landau level basis and solve the 
resulting Hamiltonian following Ref. 23. 
 We report our  calculated  result s in Fig. S3. Here we include both the spin and the 
valley degree of freedom. The spin Zeeman coupling is ignored in the calculation. First, 
for D < 0, we find that the n < 0 side does not have clear Hofstadter butterfly pattern. 
This is because of the foll owing reason: For ABC trilayer graphene, the zeroth Landau 
level is layer polarized. With D < 0, the electron s in the conduction band are mainly 
from the top layer and the hole s in the valence band are mainly from the bottom layer. 
Since the hBN moiré supe rlattice potential applies only on the top graphene layer, only  13 / 19 
 the conduction band can feel strong moiré superlattice potential. Similarly, for the D > 
0 side, only the n < 0 side shows clear Hofstadter pattern. When magnetic field B is 
large, we can focu s purely on the zeroth Landau level. In the n > 0, D < 0 side, the 
strong moiré supe rlattice potential s plits the zeroth Landau level to Hofstadter subbands. 
From our calculation, there is always a clear gap at n = 2n0, which survives to very large 
magneti c field. Such a gap is indeed observed in the experiment and can be explained

experiment do not exist in our single particle calculation and need correlation effect s.
