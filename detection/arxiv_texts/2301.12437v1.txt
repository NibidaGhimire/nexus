1Abstract
Our study is based on an epidemiological compartmental mode l, the SIRS model. In the SIRS
model, each individual is in one of the states susceptible (S ), infected(I) or recovered (R), depend-
ing on its state of health. In compartment R, an individual is assumed to stay immune within
a ﬁnite time interval only and then transfers back to the S com partment. We extend the model
and allow for a feedback control of the infection rate by miti gation measures which are related
to the number of infections. A ﬁnite response time of the feed back mechanism is supposed that
changes the low-dimensional SIRS model into an inﬁnite-dim ensional set of integro-diﬀerential
(delay-diﬀerential) equations. It turns out that the retard ed feedback renders the originally stable
endemic equilibrium of SIRS (stable focus) into an unstable focus if the delay exceeds a certain
critical value. Nonlinear solutions show persistent regul ar oscillations of the number of infected and
susceptible individuals. In the last part we include noise e ﬀects from the environment and allow
for a ﬂuctuating infection rate. This results in multiplica tive noise terms and our model turns into
a set of stochastic nonlinear integro-diﬀerential equation s. Numerical solutions reveal an irregular
behavior of repeated disease outbreaks in the form of infect ion waves with a variety of frequencies
and amplitudes.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Mathematical modeling of epidemic dynamics goes back to the seminal work of Kermack
and McKendrick [1927] where the nowadays called ’SIR model’ was intr oduced, an acronym
from (S= susceptible, I= infected, R= recovered). The basic SIR model and its various
extensions (for a review see [1, 16]) are also called ’compartmental m odels’ since they divide
the individuals into several compartments depending on their state of health. It turned
out that the features of infectious diseases such as measles, mum ps, and rubella could to a
certain extend be captured by such simple models. A huge ﬁeld has em erged to describe
epidemic spreading in the framework of random walks in complex netwo rks [5, 6, 19, 20] and
(generalized) fractional dynamics [17, 18, 22], just to name but a f ew. A model based on a
small world network is discussed in [23, 24] and proved to be superiou r to SIR (or SEIR)
models comparing its results with data provided by the SARS outbrea k in mthe year 2003.
Time periodic outbreaks have been noticed for a long time in the dynam ics of several
diseases and were already stated in 1929 by Soper in a model for the time evolution of
measles cases [25].
The SIR model and most of its extensions are not able to describe su stained oscillations
but rather account for a single outbreak caused by the instability o f the disease free state. In
the long time limit, the endemic equilibrium is reached where the fraction s of the population
in the diﬀerent compartments attain constant values. In the langu age of dynamical systems
this behavior is known as a heteroclinic orbit, connecting in phase spa ce an unstable ﬁxed
point (healthy state) with a stable one (endemic state). In the follo wing we shall consider an
extended SIRS model where the time of immunity is ﬁnite and in the end emic equilibrium
a nonzero number of infected individuals remains present so that th e disease never become
extinct completely. In the original SIR or SIRS models, the interplay between infected and
susceptible individuals is inspired by the dynamics of the even older pre dator-prey systems
[14] and is expressed in the form of a simple bilinear term β0I(t)S(t), where I(t) andS(t)
are the number of infected and susceptible individuals and β0is the constant probability
of infection at each contact (infection rate). The predator (infe cted) ’catches’ the prey
(susceptible) by infection.
3Other work [13] considered a nonlinear infection rate according to
W=β(j)I(t)S(t) =β0Im(t)S(t)
1+αIn(t), (1)
and obtain limit cycle solutions for certain parameters m=n≥2, α >0. Tang et al.
[2008] studied the case m=n= 2 and found a weak focus and the existence of two limit
cycles. For m≥n,Wis a monotonically increasing function of Ithat saturates for m=n.
Form=n= 1 the dynamics is qualitatively the same than for the standard SIR m odel and
sustained oscillations cannot be observed. The denominator 1+ αInaccounts for mitigation
measures against the epidemics that naturally increase with increas ingI. We only note that
for the case n > mthe interaction Whas a maximum at a certain infection number. For
such nonmonotonic behavior it was shown in [28] that the dynamics in t he long time limit
approaches a stable ﬁxed point as for the original SIR or SIRS mode ls.
In the present paper we want to stay as close as possible at the sta ndard SIRS model
and will not consider additional limit cycle solutions obtained for m=n≥2 or non-
monotonic functions WofI. We therefore study a SIRS model with the most simple
nonlinear interaction of the form (1) with m=n= 1. Taking the recent Covid epidemic as
an example, such a feedback control is realized by certain containm ent measures like social
distancing, hygiene rules, or wearing masks. Normally these measur es take eﬀect after a
certain retardation that can be on the same time scale or even much longer than the time of
recovery. The time delay can be either distributed or singular. In ou r model we generalize
(1) by replacing I(t) in the feedback by a memory integral as follows
W=β0I(t)S(t)
1+αId(t)withId(t) =/integraldisplayt
−∞K(t−τ)I(τ)dτ . (2)
For the distributed case, K(t) is a given causal normalized probability density function
(PDF) introducing memory into the model. The singular time delay is a sp ecial case with
K(t−τ) =δ(t−τ−τ0) with Dirac’s δ-function.
Delay or memory terms were introduced in epidemiological models by ma ny other re-
searchers, for an overview see [21]. In a previous work we consider ed a SIRS model with
a retarded transition from the R to the S compartment, reﬂecting the rather long time of
decay of immunity [6]. From the mathematical point of view, the prese nce of a delay term in
an ordinary diﬀerential equation makes a low-dimensional system inﬁ nitely dimensional and
may allow for the occurrence of periodic, quasi-periodic or even cha otic behavior, rendering
4the dynamics much more complex [3, 10, 15]. Memory eﬀects introduc ed by ﬁnite incubation
periods, delayed infectiousness and the distribution of the recove ry period are considered in
an upcoming paper [2].
The main focus of the present paper is to analyze an epidemiological m odel that allows
for persistent periodic outbreaks of the disease, in contrast to t he standard SIR or SIRS
modelsthatshow anasymptotically constant endemic equilibrium. Tos imulate environment
ﬂuctuations, noise terms are added that may have a signiﬁcant inﬂu ence of the amplitude
and period of the oscillations.
The paper is organized as follows: After introducing the modiﬁed SIR S model with re-
tarded feedback control in part II, we perform in part III a local linear stability analysis
close to endemic equilibrium. Threshold parameters are determined f or which the endemic
equilibrium becomes oscillatory (Hopf) unstable. The existence of a H opf unstable endemic
equilibrium is crucial for the occurrence of sustainable periodic outb reaks. For the kernel
in (2) we consider a δ-function and especially an Erlang PDF which contains two free pa-
rameters and turned out to be ﬂexible enough to capture real-life s ituations [6]. In Part
IV, fully nonlinear solutions for these cases are given above thresh old and the occurrence
of persistent oscillations around the endemic equilibrium is observed. Finally, noise terms
are introduced into the infection rate, accounting for a ﬂuctuatin g environment [7]. It is
demonstrated that these terms are responsible for much more irr egular oscillations, showing
the typical behavior known from real-life data.
II. MODEL
A. SIRS model with feedback control
LetS,I,Rbe the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals, respectively
andN=S+I+Rtheir total number. Assuming a bilinear interaction between suscep tible
and infected individuals, the SIRS model has the form
dS
dt=−β0
NIS+νR (3a)
dI
dt=β0
NI S−γI (3b)
dR
dt=γI−νR , (3c)
5whereβ0is the average number of contacts per individual per time, multiplied b y the
probability of disease infection between a susceptible and an infectio us individual, and 1 /γ
is the average time of being infectious or the time of recovery. The p arameter νis the
immunity loss rate and accounts for a ﬁnite life time of immunity 1 /ν. Forν= 0 the
standard SIR model [11] is recovered.
Since no birth or death processes are considered in (3), the total number of individuals N
isconstant intime. Instead ofthenumbers S,I,Rweintroduce thefractions s(t),j(t),r(t)∈
[0,1]
s(t) =S(t)
N, j(t) =I(t)
N, r(t) =R(t)
N(4)
and obtain from (3)
ds
dt=−β0js+νr (5a)
dj
dt=β0js−γj (5b)
dr
dt=γj−νr , (5c)
Scaling the time with γand considering r+j+s= 1, the system (5) is reduced to the
nondimensional form
ds
dt=−R0(j)js+µ(1−j−s) (6a)
dj
dt=R0(j)js−j , (6b)
withµ=ν/γand
R0(j) =β(j)
γ
as the basic reproduction number. From here we allow for an infectio n number dependent
infection rate β(j) to model feedback control by mitigation measures, see eq. (1). For
arbitrary R0(j), the system (6) has a ﬁxed point
jh= 0, sh= 1, (7)
corresponding to the disease free state and becoming unstable fo rR0(0)>1. For constant
R0>1, the other ﬁxed point

R0(8)
6denotestheendemic equilibrium andisunconditionally stable. Notetha tforµ= 0, (8)turns
intoje= 0, se= 1−re, whereredepends on the initial conditions and on the dynamics.
If containment measures take eﬀect the infection rate βwill decrease. Since the strength
of the measures normally increases with the number of infected indiv iduals, it is nearby to
assume a certain dependence β=β0/f(j) or
R0(j) =r0
f(j), r 0=β0/γ (9)
andf(j)≥1 as a monotonically increasing function of jwithf(0) = 1. The endemic
equilibrium is now found from the solution of
je(1+µ)+µf(je)
r0−µ= 0 (10)
and depends on f. Taking the most simple form (2)
f(j) = 1+αj, α ≥0, (11)
eq. (10) is linear in jeand
je=µ(r0−1)
r0(µ+1)+αµ, se=1
r0(1+αje). (12)
Theinfectionnumber oftheendemic equilibrium ismonotonically decrea sing withincreasing
αdue to the containment measures. It exists again only for r0>1 where it is proved to
be always stable. for r0>1+µ/4+O(µ2) the endemic equilibrium is a stable focus. For
r0≫1,jereaches the saturation value µ/(1+µ) independent on f.
B. Retarded infection rate control
The containment measures are not instantaneously coupled to the number of infected but
follow them rather with a certain time delay. To include this issue, we int roduce the causal
probability density function (PDF) K(τ) from which the ﬁnite time of delay between cause
and eﬀect is drawn. Instead of (9) we may formulate
R0(j) =r0
f(jd(t))(13)
with the retarded infection
jd(t) =/integraldisplayt

7The delay-time PDF is normalized,

The complete model reads
ds
dt=−r0js
f(jd)+µ(1−j−s) (15a)
dj
dt=r0js
f(jd)−j . (15b)
Its solutions are deﬁned by the control parameters r0, µand depend also on the form of
f(j) andK(t). Due to the memory term, the initial conditions have to be extende d to
s(0), j(t),−∞< t≤0
if the memory is inﬁnite. In practice however, the memory has a ﬁnite lengtht0where
K(t > t0)→0. Then it is suﬃcient to integrate in (14) from t−t0totand ﬁx the initial
conditions for j(t) on the stripe −t0< t≤0.
III. STABILITY OF THE ENDEMIC EQUILIBRIUM
A. Characteristic equation
For the rest of the paper we assume fgiven as (11). To investigate the stability of the
endemic equilibrium, we insert
s=se+ueλt, j=je+veλt
into (15) and linearize with respect to ( u,v). The solvability condition reads
P(λ) =aλ2+λ/parenleftBig
r0+α˜K(λ)+aµ/parenrightBig
+r0(1+µ)+µα˜K(λ) = 0, (16)
where˜K(λ) =/integraltext∞
0exp(−λt)K(t)dtstands fortheLaplacetransformof K(t) anda= 1+1/je
withjefrom (12). Since α,a,µ,r 0>0 and˜K(0) = 1, there exists no real valued λ= 0 as
solution of (16). As a consequence, the endemic equilibrium (12) can only become unstable
due to an oscillatory (Hopf) instability.
8B.δ-kernel
Now we need to deﬁne the memory kernel. The most simple form is
K(t) =δ(t−τ0)
whereτ0is the singular delay time between cause (high incidence) and eﬀect (m easures
become active) and ˜K(λ) = exp( −λτ0). Inserting λ=iω, (16) is separated into real and
imaginary parts and a quadratic equation for the Hopf frequency ω2can be derived:

9C. Erlang kernel
Another candidate for the kernel which is able to capture a variety of behaviors is the so
called Erlang distribution (also called gamma-distribution) which has th e form
Kη,ξ(t) =ξηtη−1
Γ(η)e−ξt, η >0, ξ >0, t≥0, (19)
where the index ηmay take any positive (including non-integer) values and Γ( η) denotes
the Euler Gamma-function which recovers the standard factorial Γ(η+1) =η! whenη∈N0.
The Erlang distribution (19) contains two parameters η, ξ >0 which may take any
positive values. The Erlang PDF has the Laplace transform
ˆKη,ξ(λ) =/integraldisplay∞
−∞e−λtΘ(t)Kη(t)dt=ξη
(ξ+λ)η, (20)
where Θ( t) indicates the Heaviside unit step function which comes into play by ca usality.
The Erlang distribution is able to capture a variety of pertinent situa tions. For η= 1 the
exponential PDF is recovered. Further the two extreme cases of a globally sharp time of
immunity τ0=η/ξas well as a broadly scattered distribution can be described. A shar p
expected immunity life time τ0is obtained by the limit
lim
ξ→∞Kξτ0,ξ(t) =δ(t−τ0). (21)
whereτ0is constant. This feature can easily be seen by performing this limit in F ourier
space, replacing in (20) the Laplace variable with λ=iω, thus
lim
ξ→∞(1+iω/ξ)−ξτ0=e−iωτ0=/integraldisplay∞
−∞e−iωtδ(t−τ0)dt
which is the Fourier transform of Dirac’s δ-distribution δ(t−τ0). A broadly scattered
distribution is obtained for ˆKη,ξ(λ)→0+ forλ >0 whereas ˆK∞,ξ(0) = 1 (normalization)
is maintained. In this situation the parameters are chosen such tha t the Erlang variance is
diverging
/angbracketleft(∆t)2/angbracketright=η
ξ2→ ∞.
For 0< η≤1 the Erlang distribution is completely monotonic, for η >1 it possesses a
maximum at tm= (η−1)/ξ. The Erlang PDF has a ﬁnite mean (expected response time of
measures) /angbracketleftt/angbracketright=/integraltext∞

andη≈6.1 forξ= 1, r0= 1.6 and other parameters as in ﬁg.1. Right: Erlang distributio n for
η= 6.1, ξ= 1.
Inserting (20) into (16), an analytic solution for ωis no longer accessible. Instead we
propose a graphical solution by plotting the zero contours of real and imaginary parts of
P(iω) in the ( ω,η) plane and looking for their intersections (ﬁg.2). Thus, for ﬁxed r0andξ
a minimal value of ηfor the instability of the endemic state as well as the Hopf frequenc y
can be determined.
Atr0= 1.6 andξ= 1 we see from ﬁg.2 a minimal value of η≈6.1. In this case the
Erlang distribution has its maximum at tm≈5.1.
IV. NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS
A. Deterministic model

over time t. Forr0= 1.6 the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable for τ0>4.9 with
the Hopf frequency ω= 0.33. Ifτ0is increased, the oscillations become more and more
anharmonic, their frequency decreases and their amplitude increa ses signiﬁcantly, together
with the mean values of j. We ﬁnd
< j >=je= 0.009 (τ0<4.9), < j > = 0.01 (τ0= 5.2), < j > = 0.012 (τ0= 6.2).

(black) and τ0= 6.2 (red). Time in units of the recovery time 1 /γ.
2. Erlang kernel
Taking the Erlang distribution, the memory integral (14) must be ap proximated with a
ﬁnite lower limit
jd(t) =/integraldisplayt
t−t0K(t−τ)j(τ)dτ . (23)
12and numerically evaluated by a sum over the last n=t0/δttime steps. We chose t0= 5tm
wheretmdenotes the maximum of K(t), resulting in an error in the order of K(t0)/K(tm)≈
2·10−6. For the largest η= 7 we have n= 30000. Fig.4 shows the number of infectious
and the actual eﬀective reproduction number for this case, again for the parameters of (3)
forη= 6.5 andη= 7.0. From the linear theory onset of oscillations is expected at η≈6.2,
compare ﬁg.2. The results are at least qualitatively similar to those of theδ-kernel. This is
due to the fact that the Erlang distribution for η≈6 has a pronounced and rather sharp
maximum, cmp. ﬁg.2, left frame. On the other hand, a monotonically d ecreasing kernel
would not lead to an oscillatory instability.

B. Stochastic model
There exist plenty of possibilities to extend the model considering no isy perturbations
coming from the environment. A nearby assumption is that of a ﬂuct uating infection rate
which was studied for a SIRS model without memory and therefore w ithout an oscillatory
13instability in [7]. To this end we replace r0in (15) by
rf(t) =r0(1+σξ(t))
whereξ(t) is a Gaussian distributed random variable (white noise) with
< ξ(t)>= 0, < ξ (t)ξ(t′)>=δ(t−t′)
andσdenotes the noise intensity. Thus, the stochastic model reads no w

System (25) is integrated numerically. For accuracy reasons we tr eated the deterministic
part again by a 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme with δt= 10−3. The random variable zkis
14computed by an equally distributed series zk=±1 with probability 1/2, fulﬁlling (26). The
result for σ= 0.075 is shown in ﬁg.5. A main inﬂuence of the noise terms can be seen on
the amplitudes of the oscillations. Contrary to the series of ﬁg.3 the re is now no distinct
diﬀerence between the amplitudes of τ0= 5.2 andτ0= 6.2. The main frequency decreases

173. Outbreaks
For large σthe infection dynamics shows long phases where the infection numbe r remains
very small, interrupted by sharp periodic bursts, ﬁg.9. The amplitud es of these outbreaks
are larger up to a factor 10 than those for the deterministic model (ﬁg.4) and may diﬀer
stronglyfromeachother. Inthiscontext itisinteresting tonotet hatforlarge σ, theminimal
values for j(t) become very small. For the series with σ= 0.6 we have min( j)≈10−6, for
σ= 1 we ﬁnd min( j)≈10−9. But if the population Nis ﬁnite, the minimal number of
infected individuals according to (4) is Im=Nmin(j). If we take N≈108, corresponding to
the population of a rather large country, for j <10−8there would be no infected individual
anymore and the disease would have become extincted. Thus, large ﬂuctuations could lead
to extinction even if the basic reproduction number stays larger th an one, a result already
shown by Cai et al. [2015]. For our model we estimate the critical sigm a for extinction with

r0.
Not very realistic if for instance compared with data from the recen t COVID waves are the
rather equal times between the outbreaks. Here it could be possib le to include ﬂuctuations
also in the immunity loss rate or in the delay times of the feedback cont rol. External eﬀects
like seasonal variations could be included as well, a program that we wa nt to study in
forthcoming work.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we studied the inﬂuence of delayed feedback control on the dynamics of
a standard SIRS model. Delay terms normally generate oscillatory (H opf) instabilities of
otherwise stable ﬁxed points if the delay time exceeds a certain critic al value. Finite time
delays, or, for the continuous case, memory eﬀects come into play quite naturally by the
rather long time scales of macroscopic eﬀects like a ﬁnite time of immun ity, the time neces-
sary for the emergence of certain virus mutants, or the time need ed to establish mitigation
measures. From this list it is clear that there exist many possibilities to extend the model
including one or even more memory terms with diﬀerent kernels. For a n upcoming project
it could be of interest to study the interplay of two or more diﬀerent delay terms on an
18otherwise low-dimensional deterministic dynamics and see if quasi-pe riodic or even chaotic
solutions may occur. It is known for long that rather simple delay-diﬀ erential equations like
the Mackey-Glass equation [15] or the sinusoidal nonlinearity [26] show chaotic solutions if
the time delay becomes large enough.
Further interesting generalizations could be opened by considering fat-tailed memory
kernels withpower-lawdecays andwithdivergingmeans(verylongde laytimes). Accounting
for such kernels leads naturally to time-fractional generalizations of SIR or SIRS models. In
particular the combination of random walk models and memory eﬀects induced by renewal
processes such as the fractional Poisson process and its genera lizations [9, 17, 18, 22] (and
many others, see references therein) may be of interest as well.
On the other hand, additional degrees of freedom may be encount ered by including en-
vironmental noise leading to ﬂuctuating parameters of the SIR or S IRS models. Then,
simulations in the frame of stochastic nonlinear diﬀerential equation s with multiplicative
noise come into the focus of attention. The present paper tries to study the combined in-
ﬂuence of retarded feedback control and ﬂuctuations due to a c oupling to the environment
onto the same parameter, namely the infection rate. We found tha t noise my lead to large
ﬂuctuations of amplitude and frequency of the otherwise very reg ular oscillations provided
by the time delayed feedback control alone. In this context, the d iscussion of a correspond-
ing Fokker-Planck equation of (24) could be of interest. Such an eq uation was derived for
(24) in [7], but for the case without delay terms. Here we would need t he extension of the
Fokker-Planck theory to delay terms, a task that we shall leave fo r future work.
Our model can be extended in diﬀerent directions. A ﬁnite duration o f being immune
can as well be included and modeled by a memory term with another give n PDF as done in
our recent paper [6]. Spatial eﬀects can be taken into account by in cluding diﬀusion terms
in the infection rate equation or considering the dynamics on small-wo rld networks. Finally,
space and time varying infection rates could be introduced to model seasonal variations and
density distributions of the population.
