Abstract
Exploiting the framework of peridynamics, a dimensionally-reduced formula-
tion for plates is developed that allows for the through-thickness nucleation
and growth of fracture surfaces, enabling the treatment of delamination in a
lower-dimensional model. Delamination fracture nucleation and propagation
are treated by choosing the kinematics to be composed of an absolutely con-
tinuous part and a zone where jumps in the displacements are allowed. This
assumption allows the explicit derivation of the dimensionally-reduced elastic
energy, which shows a hierarchy of terms characterising the stored energy in a
the plane element. An interpretation of the various terms of the reduced energy
is shown by means of the simplest paradigm of bond-based peridynamics. A
striking feature of the reduced energy is that, despite the small-displacement
assumption, there is a coupling between the membrane and bending terms.
Semi-analytical solutions for simplied settings are obtained through a mini-
mization procedure, and a range of nonstandard behaviors such as distal crack
nucleation and curved crack path are captured by the model. Finally, the con-
vergence of the proposed peridynamic reduced model to a local elastic theory
for vanishing nonlocal lengthscale is determined, giving a local cohesive model
for fracture.

Delamination is a mode of failure that is typical of thin plate and shell
structures in which the thickness is much smaller than the other two dimen-
sions. This mode of failure is characterised by a fracture in which the crack
front propagates within the plane of the structure, resulting in the structure
being broken up into layers. Composite laminates, which naturally present a
weak plane at the interface between dierent materials, are especially vulnera-
ble to delamination, but it can occur in microstructured and homogeneous thin
structures as well [1, 2].
This mode of fracture has been studied through a variety of approaches.
Leading approaches include Cohesive Zone Models (CZM) [3{8] and the ex-
tended nite element methods (XFEM) [9, 10]. More recently, the phase-eld
technique for fracture has been used to model debonding in laminates [11, 12].
These models, however, treat the thin structure as a fully three-dimensional
body and treat delamination explicitly.
In a distinct approach to the modeling of thin plates without accounting
for delamination, an established procedure with a long history is to derive two-
dimensional formulations for plates or lms based on systematically reducing
the three-dimensional theory using that the thickness is much smaller than
the other dimensions. This has been studied in a variety of settings, and are
particularly attractive as they can lead to faster computational algorithms with
good convergence properties while still capturing the key physical phenomena
[13{18].
The aim of this work is to develop an approach that combines the advan-
tages of dimensionally-reduced models while also accounting for delamination.
That is, we aim to derive a two-dimensional model of plates that allows for
delamination failure. Our approach is based on using peridynamics [19, 20], a
nonlocal theory that models continuum bodies as a collection of innitesimal
material particles that interact through long-range forces, rather than the typi-
cal contact tractions. In contrast to local theories of continuum mechanics that
rely on the denition of strain, consequently constraining the displacement to
have sucient regularity, peridynamics works directly with the displacement
and does not require regularity a priori . This makes it attractive to model
damage, damage-fracture transition [21{26], and dynamic phenomena such as
impact and blasts [27{30].
Papers dealing with two-dimensional peridynamic bodies can be divided into
two main categories based on the approach: (1) full 3D numerical simulations
[31{33], and (2) 2D reduced models [34{43]. While the former approach has
been extensively used to treat delamination explicitly [44{46], existing reduced
formulation only account for crack propagation with the crack tip oriented nor-
mal to the plane and thus cannot capture phenomena such as delamination.
In this work, a reduced formulation of bond-based peridynamics, tailored to
account for through-thickness delamination in thin plates characterized by a
single material and no preexisting weak interface, is introduced. As a rst step,
in Section 3, the displacement eld is additively decomposed into its absolutely
2continuous part and its jump to account for delamination fracture nucleation
and propagation. That is, the natural function space for the displacement eld
is the space of functions of Special Bounded Variations (SBV), e.g. [47, 48].
Further assumptions on both parts of the displacement eld lead to a reduced
form of the peridynamics energy in Section 3.4. The reduction procedure gen-
erates a hierarchy of terms characterising the strain energy stored inside the
two-dimensional continuum element. A striking feature of the reduced energy
is that, despite the small displacement assumption, there is a coupling between
the membrane and bending terms. The hierarchy of the resulting functional
allows for a consistent variational approach, enabling the displacement elds to
be obtained by a minimization procedure.
Semi-analytical solutions for test cases are then obtained in Section 4. The
tests are performed on a thin cantilever plate, modeled with the proposed re-
duced formulation. In the rst case, such a plate undergoes an imposed upward
vertical displacement of the upper part of the free edge and a downward vertical
displacement of the lower edge in a symmetrical manner - much like a peeling
test. The model shows that variation of the nonlocal interaction lengthscale
, also called the horizon, induces dierent behaviors, namely distal or prox-
imal damage nucleation. In the second case, an asymmetry is introduced by
imposing the vertical upward displacement at various points of the upper edge
of the plate, leading to non-symmetric crack propagation. In the third case,
Mode-II fracture or sliding delamination is studied. In order to explore the cou-
pling between bending and membrane terms in the reduced formulation (which
is geometrically linear) in a local setting, in Section 5, we examine the conver-
gence of the proposed model to a local theory when the nonlocal interaction
scaletends to zero. By enforcing a condition of bounded and non-vanishing
energy, the scaling of the displacement eld with is established; this, in turn,
determines the scaling of all the terms in the energy, thereby allowing for the
localization of the nonlocal model, leading to a reduced local formulation. The
reduced local formulation has a cohesive structure, due to some terms of the
energy associated with the jump part of the displacement surviving the limit
operation.
Organization. In Section 2, the constitutive framework of bond-based peridy-
namics is summarized. Section 3 sets up the theoretical framework for the
reduced formulation, and the reduced elastic energy density of a peridynamic
plate is obtained and interpreted. The theoretical model is then implemented
in a variational setting to be tested in simple loading conditions in Section
4. Lastly, in Section 5, the behavior of the reduced formulation proposed for
vanishing horizon is investigated.
2. Formulation of the peridynamics model
Bond-based peridynamics models a continuum body Bas a collection of
material particles interacting with one another, in pairs, through bonds. The
3equation for the static equilibrium of the body [19, 49] can be written as the
integrodierential equation

Hf(x;x0;u;u0) dVx0+b(x) = 0; (1)
where:f, called the pairwise force eld, is the force exerted between material
particlexandx0, it can depend on the displacements uof such particles and
hosts all the constitutive information of the model; bis the vector of external
body force; Hrepresents the so-called family ofxand is the set of all the
material points that are within a characteristic distance from it, called horizon,

require the pairwise force eld, f, to be anti-symmetric with respect to particles
switch [19]
f(x;x0;u;u0) = f(x0;x;u0;u): (2)
Constitutive relations for the denition of fhave been proposed by many au-
thors [19, 50], among which one of the simplest is the standard linear elastic

2.1. A microstructural interpretation of peridynamics
The present study proposes a dimensionally reduced formulation of peridy-
namic plates with a particular focus on through-thickness fracture propagation.
Since the model, developed in Section 3, shows unconventional scalings of the en-
ergy terms due to its nonlocal (peridynamic) nature, in the present preliminary

section a possible micro-structural interpretation of peridynamics, functional to
the mechanical characterization of our model, is discussed.
The possibility to pass from the continuum to the discrete level is crucial in
problems involving the transition from elastic to dissipative phenomena such
as damage and fracture. Nevertheless, the exact equivalence between a given
peridynamic model and a corresponding microstructure is usually not trivial to
nd. One possible interpretation, available from purely energetic arguments,
can be given by means of a discrete structure, see Appendix B. To stress such
observations, we build a simple numerical example in which a structure made
of interconnected linear elastic elements leads to a densely packed truss ensem-
ble. Despite one would assume that the asymptotic behavior for an increasing
number of micro-beams of the structure tends to that of a standard local contin-
uum, we demonstrate that {for a prescribed topology{ signicant discrepancies
in terms of displacements emerges between discrete and homogenised local con-
tinuum. Figure 2 depicts the case of a cantilever beam (1 meter long and 0.4
meters thick), built by assembling trusses in a net-like pattern as displayed in
the inset of such gure. These trusses are connecting each material point of
the body with all the others that satisfy a relative distance requirement. The
parameters involved, namely axial stiness of the beams and horizon length, are

calibrated in such a way that the behavior under tension reproduces that of an
ideal homogenized continuous local beam. In Figure 2 the deection of the struc-
tured beam when subjected to a vertical force applied at one end is compared
with local theories (in red Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam overlapping
one onto the other) and with the predictions of peridynamics (PD, in blue).
Failing of local theories to correctly characterize the bending behavior for the
example introduced above, can be ascribed to the intricate internal structure of
the beam.
3. A dimensionally-reduced model for thin plates
In order to develop the analytical calculations necessary for the formulation
of a dimensionally reduced model for plates, certain assumptions are made on
both the kinematics of the plate and on the constitutive relation of the bond-
based peridynamic continua.
3.1. Kinematics
Since the fracture of a material can be seen as the nucleation and growth
of a discontinuity in its displacement eld, one can additively partition the
kinematics into a continuous part, accounting for elastic deformations, and a
jump part, accounting for the displacements due to the delamination, namely:
u(x) =ua(x) +uJ(x); (6)
where the index aindicates the absolutely continuous part while the index J
denotes the jump part. In this sense, it can be said that uis a function in the
space of Special Bounded Variations (SBV) [47, 48].
We now restrict ourselves to the study of thin bodies, B, characterized by a
constant thickness H. Given a region of the three-dimensional euclidean space
E3, and a Cartesian reference frame ( O;x 1;x2;x3), Figure 3, the absolutely
6continuous part of the displacement is approximated by a polynomial expansion
as follows
ua(x)A(x1;x2) +B(x1;x2)x3+: (7)
It is important to highlight that the choice of the reduction plane (the expansion
point in the expansion above) can have eects on the hierarchical distribution
of terms in the reduced formulation [35]. In the sequel the midplane of the plate
is chosen to perform the dimension reduction, so as to align with classical local
elastic reduced formulations.

agation, here also referred as delamination. Each point of the reference conguration lying
on possible delamination surfaces to be determined jumps to a new position specied by the
vectorj(x1;x2).
The jump part of the displacement eld will be represented in a rather general
way as
uJ(x) =j(x1;x2)(x3 h(x1;x2)); (8)
where theh(x1;x2) can be regarded as the crack surface, dening the surface on
which a displacement discontinuity may arise, while  is the Heaviside function;
lastly,j(x1;x2) is the vector function dening the jump itself. It is worth noting
that mixed-mode fracture processes are allowed by the ansatz made above on uJ.
Due to the kinematic split imposed on equation (6), the relative displacement
eld now reads as follows:
=a+J: (9)
3.2. Damage
It is important to highlight that in nonlocal theories a discontinuity in the
displacement eld does not necessarily mean fracture nucleation/propagation, as
particles that are already separated by a nite distance can very well withstand a
jump in their relative displacement. In PD, what ensures the eective occurrence
of damage is the function (4), which represents the failure criterion for the
bonds. Indeed, the state of interaction can be determined by means of equation
(4), which enforces a critical stretch condition ( s < s cr) [19, 52, 53]. In many
other cases available in the literature, instead of a critical elongation criterion,
7an energy-based one is employed [54{56]. Such a criterion relates the breakage
of a bond to the attainment of a threshold in the stored energy, called critical
bond energy !cr. Both the critical stretch and critical energy are typically
evaluated by means of an energy comparison with the standard local theory of
fracture mechanics. In particular, the PD energy necessary for the growth of a
new surface in the body, dened as the energy required to break all the bonds
which pass through that particular surface (Figure 4), is imposed to be equal to
the critical energy release rate of Grith theory [57], an operation that ensures
the recovery of the Grith theory in the limit of small horizon [25, 58, 59].
Figure 4: Computation of the total energy necessary to break all the bonds connecting the
material point xwith thosex0on the other side of the fracture surface h(x).
In this fashion, for the case of the critical stretch, one obtains [34, 60]

whereGcis the critical energy release rate and is a scalar function of the
shape of the family Hand on(jj).
The transition from damage to fracture is therefore naturally tracked by the
failure mechanism of PD.
3.3. Lagrangian formulation
Under certain conditions [61], the solution of the equilibrium problem of the
nonlocal PD body coincides with the stationary points of the following functional
[62{64]:

Accordingly, one can dene H=HH3, where

Similarly, we refer to the result of the through-thickness integration of the work
of the external loads (second addend in parenthesis in equation (13)) as  W.
All the functionals involved in (13) are nonlocal, as the unknown function u
is evaluated at dierent points of the body. An equivalent form of the Euler-
Lagrange equation for nonlocal functionals is now necessary to nd the station-
ary points of (13). The search for stationary points within the interior of the
domain of the functional (or its minimization) has been investigated in [65]. For
the particular case of static and elastic PD nonlocal functional [62{64] one has
that the following implication holds:

In order to retrieve equation (15), condition (2) must be enforced on the results
of [62{64].

for a bond-based peridynamic body. For the linear elastic case, the inuence
of the function appearing in (3) on the overall behavior has been indirectly
investigated in Bobaru at al. [53]. There, the authors have shown how the shape
of the micromodulus function has indeed consequences on the overall behavior
of the material, albeit this does not inuence the rate of convergence for a
vanishing horizon. The result is critical to this work , where the consequences
of a localization procedure on the reduced peridynamic model will be explored
(section 5) with the objective of retrieving a local reduced formulation for plates.
For the purpose of simplifying the calculations, drawing on the results discussed
above [53], condition = 1 is enforced in the sequel. Neglecting the failure
parameter (denoted by in equation (4)) allows the evaluation of the reduced
form of the energy for the fully elastic case, i.e. when the load has yet to break

For simplicity, equation (17) has been specialized for the plane strain case.
The variables x1andx0
1represent respectively the in-plane component of the
position vector for particle xandx0. Furthermore, we have used A=fA1;A3g,
B=fB1;B3gandj=f0;j3g. The latter limits the kinematics to that of a
pure Mode-I fracture. It is possible to see how the dimension reduction of the
pairwise potential function generates a hierarchy of terms characterizing the
strain energy stored inside the planar element.
In Appendix B, following the microstructural interpretation given in section
2.1 and through the denition of a paradigmatic case of discrete peridynamics,
a simple tool for the physical interpretation of the various terms in the reduced
energy of our peridynamic continuum is presented. Thanks to the paradigmatic
case, it is possible to give an immediate physical interpretation to the terms of
(17) that are scaling with the square p1and the fourth power p2of the thickness,
that is the former are membrane terms and the latter bending.
From an analysis of the expression of p1(see eq. (18)), since A1(x1) is the
in-plane component of the displacement eld for the points on the reduction
plane, it can be conrmed that the terms scaling with H2of!red,a can be
regarded as purely membrane. In the higher-order term, on the contrary, such
asp2(equation 19) which multiplies H4, one can assess the presence of purely
bending contributions (for example, those depending solely on B1(x1)2), but also
of mixed ones. The mixed terms introduce the coupling of membrane behavior
and bending behavior. This is a unique feature of the nonlocal formulation .
Indeed, coupling between the membrane and bending behaviors is a feature not
easily recoverable in local theories, as shown in Appendix C. In Section 5 it is
shown that the coupling is lost when the peridynamic model is localized, namely
the reduced energy is evaluated in the limit of vanishing horizon .
11Lastly, the terms scaling with H6are higher order ones depending only on
B3(x1), which is the nonlocal equivalent of a strain deformation through the
thickness@x3(uae3), wheree3is the unit vector normal to the plane ( x1;x2).
We note that in order to recover the kinematics of the Kirchho plate theory
B3(x1) must be null.
The contribution of the jump part of the displacement eld to the reduced en-
ergy, reected in !red,J, is more scattered. We see contributions of the jump eld
to both membrane, mixed and bending-related quantities. Here, again, coupling
occurs between the dierent elds of the jump part of the displacement and the
continuous part. The highest order term in the thickness (H) is determined
by the order of the truncation in the Taylor expansion of the continuous part
of the displacement. By retaining only terms up to the rst order in x3, the
highest power becomes 6. This particular choice was made in order to check
the convergence of the nonlocal model, which will be done in the last section of
this work.
4. Model implementation and applications
Under the aforementioned conditions, the solution for the Euler-Lagrange
system of equations (15) of the PD model was achieved by using a Galerkin
approach, resulting in a system of the kind

which can be solved iteratively.
A Mathematica code has then been developed in order to test the model under
dierent loading conditions. We here present displacement-induced tests for
symmetric and non-symmetric load distributions.
The results have shown that the reduced model is capable of reproducing both
traditional and unconventional mechanical behavior such as distal crack nucle-
ation and loss of symmetry in the crack pattern.

vertical displacements at the upper and lower edges using the present formulation. In the
upper part: on the left, the evolution of the force-displacement response and the schematic

part: level curves representing the displacements - normalized with respect to the imposed
one - showing the evolution of crack surface h(x), represented by the dashed blue line, as the
imposed displacements at the edges increase.
4.1. Displacement-induced peeling test
The peridynamic reduced formulation proposed above is used to study the
case of displacement-controlled test inducing through-thickness fracture of a
cantilever plate. As shown in Figure 5, the plate is loaded by the application
of a pair of vertical displacements to the upper and lower part of the free edge.
The initial geometry necessitates neither an a priori crack nor a notch in order
to develop a crack. This is due to the damage being implemented at the con-
stitutive level in the peridynamic theory and to the kinematic assumptions on
the damage-fracture transition taken before.
The test has been carried out until a nal vertical displacement of around H/600,
a quantity which is sucient for the development of fracture for the chosen
elastic and critical parameters (see Table 1). In Figure 5 (above), in blue, the
normalized force vs displacement plot is presented, while in red is the fraction
of bonds that have yet to break near the loaded area. The latter has been used
13to investigate the propagation of damage before and during fracture growth. In
particular, both damage and fracture surfaces rst develop at a distal section
from the plate edge (loci of the applied load) as shown in Figure 5 (below), and
then propagate in both directions, as observed, e.g., in laminated paper [18].
This unusual response is obtained for a signicant nonlocal character of the peri-
dynamic continuum, i.e. horizon larger than the thickness of the plate. In fact,
by reducing this parameter the interaction becomes more local and a dierent
response is obtained where the crack nucleates closer to the free edge, ultimately
reaching it in the limit of vanishing horizon which is a typical result of standard
local continuum theories. Figure 6 shows the results of a parametric analysis of
ringing from a value of twice the thickness H down to approximately zero, the
value at which the fracture is nucleating and propagating from the cross-section
at the free edge (where the load is applied). When in a peridynamic discrete

body or continuum the horizon is reduced, the number of total interactions,
i.e. the bonds, of a point is also reduced. As a consequence, the behavior of
the structure becomes less cohesive; this feature is clearly shown in the force-
displacement plots of the various cases depicted in Figure 6. Surprisingly, the
cohesive trait is not completely lost in the local case as is shown in the next Sec-
tion. Finally, the red lines in the force plots are the relative number of broken
14bonds, thus they represent the total damage in the zone of the load application.
Along with the loss in cohesiveness, a reduction in the number of bonds is due
to aect the overall stiness of the plate. We hence display the result of a com-
parison of the plate behavior for dierent horizon sizes, given a constant overall
stiness. This condition can be obtained by increasing the bond constant cof
the peridynamic model as decreases; having in mind the paradigmatic micro-
structure of a peridynamic discrete body, an increase in cis achieved by thick-
ening each beam that represents a bond, see Figure 7 (see Appendix B). In the
same gure, the comparison shows that the nonlocal micro-structure is capable
of absorbing more energy, displaying thus superior toughness when compared
with the cases of smaller horizons, which are in this sense more brittle. The
relationship between horizon size and total dissipated energy seems to be less
than linear as, from our study, an increase of four times the volume of inter-
action has brought about an increase of total energy dissipated by 1.5 times.

that is the damaging onset, the nucleation of fracturing embryos and the crack
advancement in the very close regions.
4.2. Non-symmetric load distribution inducing a through-thickness crack
Starting from the previous case of a symmetrically loaded plate, we here
explore the eects of an asymmetry in the application of the loads on the crack
surface of a cantilever plate. The non-symmetric loading condition is achieved
by pulling the upper edge in multiple points while the lower edge of the plate
is still pulled from a single one, see Figure 8 on the right. The parameters used
for the simulation are c= 7618N/mm6(bond constant), =H=2 (the horizon),
15scr= 0:02036 (critical elongation of a single bond) and the test has been carried
out until a nal vertical displacement of approximately H/20.
As far as the crack path is concerned, the non-symmetric load distribution in-
duces an unexpected non-symmetric crack trajectory which nucleates and prop-
agates from the external section towards the center of the plate, see Figure 8.
This sensitivity of crack path to even slight loss of symmetry in the prescribed
boundary conditions is not typically achieved in thin structures obeying Saint
Venant's principle.

4.3. Mode-II fracture propagation
Nonlocal peridynamic plates can show loss of continuity through the thick-
ness due to the action of an external couple. To show this, a clamped peridy-
namic plate is loaded through the application of two opposing forces, applied at
the upper and lower edge of the free end of the plate, with a growing inclination
(see Figure 9). The mechanical and geometrical parameters chosen for the sim-
ulation are the same as the previous case shown in Section 4.2. Upon reaching
a condition of forces almost horizontal (zero inclination, Figure 9 on the right)
the characteristic distal nucleation shown for the previous case of opposing ver-
tical forces and Mode-I failure is lost and a more \classical" crack growth is
exhibited with nucleation occurring at the free-end section in a Mode-II fash-
ion. Nonetheless, in the latter case, the evolution of the crack is not continuous
and, at a later stage, a more distal crack nucleates far from the rst.
As a last observation it is useful to highlight that from the various examples
presented above it emerges a complex and rich interaction between the applied
loads and the displacement eld. This makes it very hard to substitute a spe-
cic load distribution with a possible static equivalent, such as the resultant,
to be applied to a dimensionally reduced plate. The need to follow fractur-
ing/delamination processes makes forces with overall vanishing resultants as
16relevant as not vanishing ones, the nonzero force and couple resultants being
thus not the sole eective loads to be considered. Indeed, the two opposite forces
of the rst example, applied at the same free surface of the plate along the same
vertical direction, give zero global resultant but are however very relevant for
delamination, consistently with the classical peeling tests.

in the plate by the forces for the two cases, displaying dierent crack nucleation and growth
(blue dotted line). Lastly, in the lower part of the Figure, it is depicted the deformed shape
of the nonlocal plate corresponding to an imposed horizontal displacement of u=H = 0:003
(with an amplication of 40 times).
175. Convergence to a local elastic model
Convergence of the proposed PD model to local elasticity is assured for
the continuous part of the displacement eld only [62, 66{68]. Nonetheless,
with appropriate scaling of the jump eld functions, convergence for vanishing
horizon leads to a bounded form of the energy.
By applying (9) to (5), the rst term of (12), which is the elastic energy of a
bond-based PD body, becomes

To ensure convergence for vanishing nonlocality, i.e. !0, the scaling of each
term must be checked.
5.1. Peridynamic parameter evaluation
Isotropic homogeneous linear elastic materials in the bond-based peridy-
namic theory are characterized by one single constant, called the bond constant
c. This is due to the fact that the value of the Poisson's ratio for a bond-based
material is xed to 1 =4 or 1=3 depending on the dimension of the problem, leav-
ing only one parameter tunable. The constant is typically dened by means of
an energetic equivalence with standard local elastic material. It has huge eects
on the value of this constant under what conditions this equivalence is imposed,
i.e. isotropic expansion, pure elongation or even shear. The energy obtained
after the convergence to the local model is, in fact, aected by the choice of
the bond constant to the point that certain terms can converge to classical ones
typical of local theories while others may not. For example, if one were to make
the choice of imposing equivalence of the stretching energy in the peridynamic
model and in the local elastic one, only rst-order terms in H of the localized
PD model would converge while quadratic, cubic and higher-order ones would
not.
Commonly, for the evaluation of the bond constant through energy equiv-
alence with local continua, the choice of isotropic expansion is made for the
deformation map. This choice is not expected to make all the terms converge to
the classical ones, but it can give a general idea of the possibilities of the model
obtained by the convergence. The energy density for a bond-based PD linear
elastic material under isotropic expansion ( =) is dened as

whereis a scalar function which depends on the shape of the family H, the
dimension of the problem d, and the parameter bwhich comes from the choice
of(jj) =jjb. Likewise, the energy of an isotropic expanding linear elastic
material in classic local elasticity is dened as

18whereIis the identity tensor, while Eis the fourth-order elasticity tensor, E is
Young's modulus of the local elastic material and is Poisson's ratio.
By enforcing equivalence between the energies (24) and (25) one recovers
c=3E

In the case of a spherical horizon, one obtains
c=15 E

According to (26), the scaling of the bond constant is then dened as cb 4 d.

to be scaling as

since the scaling of cis dened in (27), and the other terms scale as follow: jj
;jjm;V0d. For the integral term to stay bounded and nonvanishing
one requires m= 1.
Hence,a1, which means that
arxA(x1;x2)+rxB(x1;x2)x3+B(x1;x2)e3+ (29)
denes the scaling of the shape functions, since 1. In particular, no scaling
is required
rxA(x1;x2)0;rxB(x1;x2)0;B(x1;x2)0: (30)
In a similar fashion, the second term of (23) must follow the following scaling:

jjb(J)(a)dVdV0 (4 b+d) b+(2+m+n)+d= 2+m+n:(31)
In order for the energy to stay bounded the scaling of the jump part of the
displacement eld (dened by n) must fulll the condition of n1, since from
(28)m= 1. Accordingly, from the last term of the energy one obtains:
Z

Hc
jjb(J)2dVdV0 (4 b+d) b+2(1+n)+d=2(n 1); (32)
which gives the redundant condition: n1. In view of (8) and for vanishing
nonlocality one can approximate the relative jump displacement Jas

h(x1;x2) and the energy to be bounded, the following scaling must hold
rxj0;j0;rxh0: (35)
5.3. The scaling of the failure criterion
Alongside the energy, also the damage criterion ( s < s cr) scales as !0.
The scaling of the critical stretch scris dened by equation (10), so scr 1=2.
The scaling of the stretch s, on the other hand, can be obtained by employing
equations (33) and (34)
s=ru0
Jj=0
jj2=ru0
Jj=0:

jj2: (36)
The second tensor in the double dot product1is a quantity that scales as 0
whereas the rst tensor harbors a singularity, the Dirac's Delta function ,
which forx3=h(x1;x2) makes the stretch innite. Hence, whenever on the
crack surface, the criterion is immediately not satised. Finally:
s<s cr!
False for x3=h(x1;x2)
True otherwise(37)
5.4. Localized energy in plane strain
localization of the PD non-local model has been obtained by means of a
limit operation, for vanishing , on the PD non-local elastic energy. The local-
ized energy obtained in this way is composed of a part entirely dened by the
continuous part of the displacement eld, the term (28), and a part composed
by mix and purely jump terms

Equation (38) basically represents a material with cohesive constitutive law due
to the energy associated with a jump in the displacement.
The localized formulation of the nonlocal model introduced in section 3 can
now be obtained by writing the Lagrangian for a local plate where the internal
energy is that of equations (39-40) and then minimizing it.

such that

such that
uJ[x1;x3] =f0;j3(x1) (x3 h(x1))g; (44)

respectively. It is worth mentioning that the limiting local energy for the con-
tinuous part of the displacement is a quantity resembling the classical result
for Kirchho plates: Elocal;a =H3E

3(x1)2, where for obvious reasons a
Poisson ratio of 1 =4 has to be considered.
6. Conclusions
In the present paper, a reduced model for the explicit study of though-
thickness fracture nucleation and propagation in thin structures is put forward.
The model is obtained by making a hypothesis on the kinematics of the thin
element, which is assumed as the sum of a continuous part and a jump part. A
particular choice of these elds is made which expresses the dependence on the
out-of-plane variable explicitly, thus making the integration through the thick-
ness feasible. The resulting reduced model retains information on the loss of
continuity of the material through the functions dening the jump. The pro-
posed model has distinguished weak planes/surfaces, yet it leads to the recovery
of both horizontal and deviated crack patterns across the thickness of the plate.
The dimension reduction procedure generates a hierarchy of terms in the elastic
energy stored inside the plate. A mechanical interpretation of those terms is
possible (especially for the part of the energy associated with the continuous
part of the displacement) and is proposed through the denition of a simple
paradigm of peridynamic structure. It is found that the hierarchical form of
the energy shows the coupling of membrane and bending behavior despite the
formulation being expressed in a linear setting.
The reduced model is then tested in a symmetric displacement-induced delam-
ination test for a cantilever plate and a broad range of qualitative responses
are obtained for a varying horizon. In particular, for a horizon larger than
the height of the plate distal nucleation is observed, whereas in the limit of
vanishing horizon a classic result of linear fracture mechanics is recovered with
the propagation of the fracture starting from the loaded cross-section of the
plate. Apart from the crack path development, dierent horizons have proven
to greatly inuence the force-displacement response of the structure, leading to
superior toughness and energy dissipation in the nonlocal model with a greater
horizon and a more brittle behavior in the case of a smaller horizon.
A non-symmetrical displacement-induced test is also performed and a relevant
sensitivity of the peridynamic plate emerges from the simulation where a curved
crack path characterizes the response at failure of the thin nonlocal element.
To further investigate the local limit of the model, localization of the nonlocal
22reduced formulation is performed. Firstly, the convergence of the nonlocal en-
ergy to a nite and non-vanishing local equivalent is assessed. The localized
reduced model shows a cohesive nature, which is expressed by the fact that en-
ergy can be stored by the part of the energy associated with the discontinuous
displacement eld when a fracture is propagating.

24Appendix B. A micro-structural interpretation for bond-based PD
The structure of bond-based peridynamic constitutive equation (3) lends
itself to an intuitive and simple physical interpretation. In fact, one can imag-
ine the body under consideration to be uniformly divided into blocks and to
substitute each block with a node embodying the mass of that specic block2.
Then, massless connections can be introduced between nodes to represent their
interactions. These connections must reect how pairs of particles exert forces
onto one another in the PD formulation.
In order to do so, one can look at how the energy is stored between pairs of
interacting volumes (or areas for a two-dimensional problem), ViandVj, of the
PD continuum model. Taking into account equation (5), by means of the mean
value theorem for integrals, one has
Ei;j=Z

(B.1)
whereandare the relative position vector and relative displacement vector
for a pair of points ( x
i;x
j), belonging to the volumes ViandVj, for which
the theorem holds, and is the angle between them. In the limit of very
small volumes ViandVjit is legitimate to assume the andfunctions to be
constant between the volumes of interest and approximate the ( x
i;x
j) with the
mid-points of each volume.
The right term of equation (B.1) resembles the energy of a truss tilted by the
angle between and a horizontal axis e1, and subjected to the edge displacement
jj. In this fashion, the stiness of the bond representing the interaction between
volumes would be
ki;j=1
2c
ViVjjj2; (B.2)
whereis now the relative position vector between mid-points of volumes Vi
andVj. Equation (B.2) implies that the stiness is proportional to some power
nof the distance between particles ki;jln
i;j(recalling that =(jj)).
Performing this type of substitution for all the pairs of nodes transforms the
continuum peridynamic body into an intricate reticular beam. The simplest
paradigm of structure that can be built by following the PD approximation
presented above is depicted in Figure B.10. The paradigmatic structure char-
acterized by simple kinematics, correctly predicts the hierarchical form of the
energy (17) and allows comparing the kinematics of the continuum with some-
thing more easily controllable, accompanying the reader in an ideal transition
2In nite-element analysis mesh renement is a powerful stratagem that allows improving
precision and accuracy of the approximated solutions for the problem at hand, in parts of the
domain where it is required. Renement procedures inevitably cause non-uniform discretiza-
tion of the domain and, in the case of peridynamics, can cause inaccuracy of the solution

25from discrete to continuum for making evident how the above-mentioned non-
standard terms have to naturally appear in the peridynamic plate model.
We hereby limit the paradigmatic structure to stretching and bending kinemat-
ics which prove to be sucient for a qualitative interpretation. In particular,
the structure is loaded by imposing horizontal displacements at the outer nodes
(nodes 1 and 2 in Figure B.10). In this condition, the total energy can easily
be obtained analytically. By denoting

material particles of the body, while the bonds are represented by the truss connecting each

=c V2
1=2. Equation (B.3) represents the equivalent energy of a peridynamic
continuum (the horizon is included implicitly since l13==l14=sin). Clearly,
membrane energy scales with the square of the thickness H, while bending energy
scales with H4dierently from the classical results of local elasticity [70, 71].
According to the reduced energy obtained in Section 3.4, the total energy of a
plate resembling the shape and loads of the paradigmatic case is recovered by
choosing L= 2 l5,=l5=cos(hence 	 = (cos )=2):

which corresponds, at least qualitatively, to (B.3) for n= 2.
26Sensitivity analysis of the paradigmatic structure to the horizon. The total en-
ergy of the paradigmatic case has been derived for a xed value of the horizon,
i.e.=l5=cos, whereas the reduced form of eq. (17) is dened for any value
of such parameter. In order to extend the above interpretation analysis using
the paradigmatic tool to the general case, a series of numerical analyses using
ANSYS APDL has been carried out on several discrete approximations of a peri-
dynamic bond-based continuum each characterized by dierent horizon sizes.
In Figure B.11 the scaling of three dierent peridynamic discrete bodies with a
horizon ranging from a minimal value (dotted green line) to one with a wider
interaction (dot-dashed dark line) is depicted. On the left, the scaling of the
membrane energy is found to be quadratic regardless of the horizon size, whereas
the bending energy (Figure B.11, on the right) scales with the fourth power of
the thickness. A geometric motivation is available for the scaling of the mem-
brane energy: the increase in the number of bonds available when the thickness
is doubled, for example, is (roughly) proportional to the square of the number
of nodes:nbondsnnodes (nnodes 1)=2.

Appendix C. Coupling in the local theory of plates
Eq. (17) is derived from an assumption on the kinematics that is typical of
therst-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), i.e. Reissner-Mindlin theory,
for local plates [72, 73]. To further address the previous result about the coupling
in eq. (17), we compare the energies for various local plate model, in accordance
with the FSDT hypothesis, against the peridynamic result. Under the condition
of FSDT, small displacements (linear elastic response) and inextensibility in the
thickness direction, the specic (per unit area) elastic energy amounts to:
!red=H

27where theA1,A3,B1andB3are to be intended as functions of x1, and!redis
now the reduced energy density of a local plate.
If one relaxes the inextensibility constraint, meaning the vertical component
of the displacement follows the linear approximation in the through-thickness
direction, the elastic energy becomes:

From the Euler-Lagrange equations that the previous type of elastic energies
can generate, one can see how only the last nonlinear model accounts for the
coupling of stretching and bending. The reason for this lies in the nonlinear
relation between the deformations and the displacement eld. The intrinsic
microstructure of a peridynamic continuum naturally accounts for a similar
eect, since the nite distances between particles makes it so that rotational
eect can be induced by the intricate connections even under axial loading and
net null moment.
