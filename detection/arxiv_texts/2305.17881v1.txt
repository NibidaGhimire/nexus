Abstract
Following the idea of Bayesian learning via Gaussian mixtur e model, we organically combine the
backward-looking information contained in the historical data and the forward-looking information
implied by the market portfolio, which is aﬀected by heterog eneous expectations and noisy trading
behavior. The proposed combined estimation adaptively har monizes these two types of information
based on the degree of market eﬃciency and responds quickly a t turning points of the market. Both
simulation experiments and a global empirical test conﬁrm t hat the approach is a ﬂexible and robust
forecasting tool and is applicable to various capital marke ts with diﬀerent degrees of eﬃciency.

1 Introduction
As the beginning of modern investment theory, Markowitz (1952) develops the mean-variance model
to determine the optimal investment decisions, which not only chara cterizes the behavioral pattern of
return-risktradeoﬀbut alsoillustrates the beneﬁts ofriskdivers iﬁcationin a quantitativeway. Obviously,
the successful application of the mean-variance model depends o n the accurate estimation of the means
and covariance matrix of asset returns. Existing studies tend to e stimate model parameters by adopting
diﬀerent sources of information, which can be roughly divided into tw o types.
The ﬁrst type is the well-developed backward-looking approach, wh ich uses statistical approaches
or econometric models to estimate expected parameters from hist orical data. This approach is a good
choice when confronted with predicting future scenarios that res emble those found in historical patterns,
or lack of other eﬀective information ( Huang et al. ,2021). However, in practice, the distribution of the
asset returns is time-varying, hence the backward-looking appro ach tends to exhibit lag near the turning

1point of the market ( Zhu et al. ,2014). As a result, the out-of-sample performance of backward-look ing
approaches is usually aﬀected by the prediction error ( Britten-Jones ,1999;Jobson and Korkie ,1980;
Ledoit and Wolf ,2004). Furthermore, the portfolios using parameters estimated with b ackward-looking
approaches are usually extremely concentrated ( Broadie,1993;Green and Holliﬁeld ,1992) and especially
sensitive to the means ( Best and Grauer ,1991;Merton,1980). The mean-variance optimization based
on historical data only is even criticized as an error maximizer ( Michaud ,1989), although there are some
approaches proposed to alleviate the inﬂuence of estimation error s (see e.g., Black and Litterman (1992);
Jagannathan and Ma (2003);Frost and Savarino (1988)).
The secondtype is the forward-lookingapproach,which uses ﬁnan cialtheoriesto speculate oninvestor
expectations from market variables such as the market portfolio a nd option prices. For the market port-
folio, a typical work is the Black-Litterman model ( Black and Litterman ,1992), where CAPM ( Sharpe,
1964) is used to specify the means of the prior distribution on expected r eturns. They assume that the
market portfolio is the optimal decision of the representative agen t with perfect rationality, thus implying
investor’s expectations on future returns. With the covariance m atrix estimated from historical data, the
expected return is derived from the ﬁrst-order conditions of the mean-variance optimization problem,
which is termed the inverse optimization approach in the sense that it recovers the expected returns
(parameters input for optimization) from the market portfolio (de cision as the result of optimization) ac-
cording to the conditions of optimality. Likewise, ( Sharpe,2007) considers a more general framework for
return forecastingby using the inverseoptimization approachbas ed on the expected utility maximization.
Another category of forward-looking approaches involves extra cting return information from option
prices, as risk-neutral quantities and the pricing kernel summariz e investors’ expectations and risk prefer-
ences.Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004)extracttheimpliedrisk-neutralprobability( Breeden and Litzenberger ,
1978) of the underlying asset from option prices and convert it into phys ical probability via the pricing
kernel. There are also ﬁndings that option-implied information helps t o improve the out-of-sample per-
formance of portfolios ( DeMiguel et al. ,2013;Kempf et al. ,2015;Kostakis et al. ,2011). However, it is
notable that estimating the physical return distribution of underly ing asset from option prices is only
applicable for a single risky asset, while the recovery of joint physica l return distribution of multiple
underlying assets remains an open problem ( Carr and Wu ,2020).
Both backward-looking and forward-looking approaches have the ir respective advantages and disad-
vantages in practice. Despite concerns regarding its out-of-sam ple performance and theoretical founda-
tions, the backward-looking approach remains a popular method fo r parameter estimations, particularly
for the terms associated with risk, such as the covariance matrix. The forward-looking approach can
theoretically possess the ability to respond quickly at turning points (Zhu et al. ,2014). However, its
predictive ability is inﬂuenced by market eﬃciency and the degree to w hich ﬁnancial theory matches the
real market. Especially, the forward-lookingapproachesusually im pose assumptions of perfect rationality
and homogeneous expectations among investors, while the impact o f noise traders on market equilibrium
always exists ( Black,1986;Kyle,1985;Long et al. ,1990). As an inverse optimization approach, another
challenging issue for the forward-looking approach is the nonunique ness of the solution of the inverse
problem.
Mostofthe existingliterature tends to makepredictions by solelyut ilizing one ofthe above-mentioned
approaches. Given the limitations of relying solely on backward-lookin g or forward-looking information,
it is prudent to incorporate information from diﬀerent sources and generate forecasts that are robust
2across a diverse range of markets. ( Cheang et al. ,2020) integrate historical data and option-implied
information in estimating the covariance matrix, which plugs risk-neu tral variances in the sample covari-
ance matrix directly. ( Huang et al. ,2021) consider a market with heterogeneous investors and propose
an attractive approach to incorporate the market-implied informa tion and historical data in expected
return forecasting, where the covariance matrix remains the one estimated by historical data.

In this paper, we propose a general method that combines backwa rd-looking and forward-looking
information for predicting returns in portfolio management. Rathe r than assuming that investors are
perfectly rational and have homogeneous expectations, we cons ider a more general market with hetero-
geneous investors and aim to extract the informed investors’ exp ectations of returns from the market
equilibrium inﬂuenced by the noise. Meanwhile, we provide a robust est imation of the means and covari-
ance matrix of returns that combines the backward-looking inform ation contained in historical data and
the forward-looking information implied in the market portfolio. In ad dition, we intend to estimate the
means and covariance matrix simultaneously, which, as an inverse pr oblem, always suﬀers from the issue
of multi-solution. To achieve these goals, we use the Gaussian mixtur e model to characterize uncertain
returns and implement the estimation in the spirit of Bayesian learning . Figure 1illustrates the logic and
the research roadmap of our work. We theoretically show that the combined estimation can adaptively
select the extent of forward-looking information to incorporate b ased on the degree of market eﬃciency,
using the historical prior as a basis. As a result, it simultaneously pos sesses the advantages of both
backward-looking and forward-looking forecasting approaches.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2introduces a novel combined forecasting
model and discusses some theoretical properties. Section 3presents simulation experiments that verify
the properties of the proposed combined estimation. Section 4provides empirical analyses across 35
markets over the world and shows its out-of-sample performance . Section 5concludes the study.
32 Model
In this section, we ﬁrst model a general market considering invest ors’ heterogeneous expectations and
irrational behaviors. Next, we propose a novel combined approac h to forecast asset returns and analyze
its characteristics of self-adativity to the degree of market eﬃcie ncy. Finally, we study a special case for
the explicit form of the combined estimation.
2.1 Market equilibrium with heterogeneous investors
In the classical CAPM model ( Sharpe,1964), the market equilibrium is based on some ideal and strict
assumptions, including homogeneous expectations and perfect ra tionality. Instead, in this paper, we
categorize investors into three types based on their available infor mation and decision-making behaviors,
namely a representative rational less-informed investor, a repre sentative rational informed investor, and a
representativenoise trader. The less-informed investorhas only historicalinformation, while the informed
investor has access to a broad knowledge of asset returns. Both types of rational investors maximize the
mean-variance utility based on their own information. The noise inves tor, as deﬁned in Kyle(1985), has
no useful information and makes decisions randomly. In reality, we c annot classify all investors so clearly,
as even an informed investor may behave irrationally. However, we b elieve that this simple classiﬁcation
can eﬀectively represent the three primary forces in the market.
Suppose there are nrisky assets and one risk-free asset available in the market. Denot er=
(˜r1−rf,...,˜rn−rf)′as the excess return of risky assets, where ˜ ri,i= 1,...,n,andrfare the re-
turns on the risky and risk-free assets, respectively. Let x= (x1,...,x n)′denote the portfolio weight on
risky assets and 1 −/summationtextn
i=1xidenote the weight on the risk-free asset. Both the less-informed investor and
the informed investor make their investment decisions with the mean -variance model. Speciﬁcally, they
determine their portfolios by solving the following optimization problem
max
xx′ˆµ−δ
2x′ˆΣx, (1)
whereˆµandˆΣ are the mean vector and covariance matrix of restimated by investors and δis the
risk-aversion coeﬃcient of investors.
DenoteδUandδI, (µU,ΣU) and (µI,ΣI) as the risk-aversioncoeﬃcients, meanvectorsand covariance
matrices speciﬁed by the less-informed investor and the informed in vestor, respectively. Accordingly, the
optimal investment decisions of these two types of investors can b e represented as
x∗
U/defines(δUΣU)−1µUandx∗
I/defines(δIΣI)−1µI. (2)
Furthermore, we assume that the informed investor has perfect knowledge on the return distribution and
their predictions are equal to the true value of the parameters ( µ,Σ), i.e.,
µI=µ,ΣI= Σ and x∗
I= (δIΣ)−1µ. (3)
In this paper, our main goal is to infer the informed investor’s expec tation (µ,Σ).
By contrast, the noise investor makes decisions randomly, repres enting the irrational part of the
4market. Assume that their holding of risky assets follows a normal d istribution
xN∼ N(0,ΣN), (4)
where0is a vector of zeros, Σ N=diag(σ1,...,σ n) is the covariance matrix, and {σi}n
i=1are the
intensities of noise trading, which implies that the random positions on risky assets are not correlated
with each others.
Now we discuss the market equilibrium. Since the three investors bor row and lend equally on risk-free
assets, the market portfolio is entirely allocated to risky assets. L etxMdenote the market portfolio, and
wU,wI, andwNdenote the wealth of the less-informed investor, the informed inve stor, and the noise
trader. The market clearing condition yields
wUx∗
U+wIx∗
I+wNxN=wxM. (5)
Dividing both sides of ( 5) bywand substituting into ( 4), we have
xM=αUx∗
U+αI(δIΣ)−1µ+ε, (6)
whereε/definesαNxN, andαU/defineswU/w, α I/defineswI/wandαN/defineswN/ware the market shares of the less-
informed investor, the informed investor, and the noise investor, respectively. Since xNis normally
distributed, the holding of the noise trader follows
ε∼ N(0n,Ω),Ω/definesα2
NΣN.
Equation ( 6) contains signiﬁcant forward-looking information about asset ret urns since the market
portfolio xMcharacterizes the market equilibrium and synthesizes investors’ e xpectations and decision-
makingbehaviors. However,becauseoftherandomterm ε,wecannotdirectlyderivetheparameter( µ,Σ)
from (6). In addition, even if the random term εcan be eliminated by adopting the expectation operator,
the estimation is still diﬃcult. Although the less-informed investor’s h oldingx∗
Ucan be determined by
the estimate ( µU,ΣU) using historical data and xMcan be directly observed, the number of unknown
parameters in ( µ,Σ) far exceeds the number of equations, which will result in several diﬃculties for
estimation, for example, the issue of multi-solution.
To address the problem, we model the return distribution via a Gaus sian mixture model (see e.g.,
Zhu et al. (2014)). More speciﬁcally, the probability density function of return ris deﬁned by
p(r) =m/summationdisplay
k=1λkpk(r|µk,Σk), (7)
wherepk(r|µk,Σk) (k= 1,···,m) is the density function of the kthGaussian component with mean
vectorµkand covariance matrix Σ k, and the mixture coeﬃcients {λk}m
k=1satisfy/summationtextm
k=1λk= 1,λk≥0.
Accordingly, the mean and covariance of asset returns are given b y

. (8)
5Since the sum of mixture coeﬃcients is equal to one, without loss of g enerality, we regard λmas a
redundant parameter and denote the ﬁrst m−1 mixture coeﬃcients as λ−= (λ1,...,λ m−1)′.
Toreducethe numberofparametersto be estimated, we reasona blysupposethe Gaussiancomponents
pk(r|µk,Σk)(k= 1,···,m) are predetermined. Then we can transform the problem of estima ting (µ,Σ)
into the estimation of λ−. Rewrite ( 6) with (8)

The process of recovering λ−from (9) can be viewed as an inverse optimization problem, where xI
andxUintegrated into the observed market portfolio xMare the result of optimization and the mixture
weightsλ−is the parameter input for optimization. Since the market portfolio c ontains the holding of
the noise trader, we recover the forward-looking information of t he informed investor from noise data.
Here, the Gaussian mixture model leads to a signiﬁcant reduction in t he number of unknown parameters,
making the inverse optimization highly tractable. Given mixture compo nents, the model requires only
m−1 mixture weights, and the number of unknown parameters is typica lly less than the number of
assets. Furthermore, the utilization of the Gaussian mixture distr ibution in this model is reasonable
both theoretically and empirically. As an unsupervised learning appro ach, the mixture distribution can
approximate virtually any distribution ( Pang et al. ,2023), which makes it a suitable choice for ﬁtting
the distribution of ﬁnancial data ( Mercuri et al. ,2021).
2.2 Combined forecasting approach
As shown in ( 6), the eﬃcacy of forward-looking information is aﬀected by noise tr ading. To achieve an
estimation that is applicable across markets with varying market eﬃc iency, we propose a novel combined
approach to estimate the return distribution by integrating inform ation from multiple channels in the
spirit of Bayesian learning (see e.g., Marisu and Pun (2023)). Speciﬁcally, we use historical data to
generate a prior distribution of mixture weights, then update with f orward-looking information in ( 9) to
obtain the posterior distribution of mixture coeﬃcients. We demons trate the advantages of combined
estimation later, speciﬁcally its ability to adaptively integrate diﬀeren t sources of information based on
the degree of market eﬃciency. More speciﬁcally, if the degree of m arket eﬃciency is relatively low, the
market portfolio does not contain valuable information on expectat ion, and the estimation is close to the
prior distribution learned from the historical data. Otherwise, if th e market is relatively eﬃcient, then
the estimation will reﬂect more of the market-implied information.
For the prior information, we adopt a Gaussian prior distribution for mixture coeﬃcients
λ−∼ N/parenleftBig
ˆλ−,Φ/parenrightBig
,
where (ˆλ−,Φ) can be estimated by existing technologies from historical data, s uch as the Expectation-
Maximization (EM) algorithm ( McLachlan and Krishnan ,2007). The large sample theory on maximum
6likelihood estimation ensures the rationality of using normal distribut ions to model the distributions of
the estimator of λ−(Zhu et al. ,2014). For the forward-looking information in ( 9), it is obvious that
xM|λ−∼ N(αUx∗
U+αIg(λ−),Ω).
Denote

the model parameter in the parameter space
Θ/defines{θ|(αI,αU,αN)′1= 1,θ>0}, (10)
and deﬁne ∝bardbly∝bardblP/defines√y′Py. We assume that the market shares of three representative inve stors and
noise intensities cannot reach zero to avoid the trivial case in which t he forward-looking information is
deterministic, and δI,δU>0 implies risk-averse investors.
Combining the prior information and forward-looking information men tioned above yields the follow-
ing results on the posterior distribution of λ−.
Proposition 1. Suppose that λ−∼ N/parenleftBig

by which we get Proposition 1with the deﬁnition of F1(λ−) andF2(λ−|θ) in (11).
In (11),F1(λ−) is associated with backward-looking information, while F2(λ−|θ) is a function of
forward-looking information extracted from ( 9). Here, although the variables we are interested in are
mixture weights λ−, we add parameter θinF2(λ−|θ) to emphasize that the forward-lookinginformation
is inﬂuenced by the three types of investors in the market, which ar e completely characterized by θ.
7Although the explicit posterior distribution is given, it is unclear which d istribution λ−|xMfollows
due to the nonlinearity of g(λ−). We propose a generalized combined forecasting model to maximize the
posterior probability, which is equivalent to solving
(PC) min
λ−∈ΓF1(λ−)+F2(λ−|θ),
where
Γ/defines{λ−:1′λ−≤1,λk≥0,k= 1,...,m−1}. (12)
Since Φ and Σ Nare positive-deﬁnite matrices and F1(λ−)+F2(λ−|θ) is a bounded continuous function
over the feasible set Γ, there exists at least one optimal solution to problem (P C).
2.3 Characteristics of combined estimation
In this section, we further analyze how the market shares, noise in tensity, and the risk-aversion degree
aﬀect the combined estimation. To do so, we deﬁne three types of e stimations of mixture weights based
on diﬀerent information.
Deﬁnition 1. The estimation λB
−is called a backward-looking estimation if λB
−is an optimal solution
to problem
(PB) min
λ−∈ΓF1(λ−);
the estimation λF
−is called a forward-looking estimation if λF
−is a optimal solution to problem
(PF) min
λ−∈ΓF2(λ−|θ);
and the estimation λC
−is called a combined estimation if λC
−is a optimal solution to problem
(PC) min
λ−∈ΓF1(λ−)+F2(λ−|θ).
We ﬁrst provide the lemma below that is useful for further analysis. The proof of this lemma is based
on the idea of Fukushima (2001) (Chap. 3).
Lemma 1. Suppose that h(λ−,θ)is a continuous function on Γ×Θ, whereΓis given in (12)andΘis
given in (10). Deﬁne
ψ(θ)/definesinf{h(λ−,θ)|λ−∈Γ}.
Then,ψ(θ)is continuous.
Proof.Note that proving the continuity of ψ(θ) is equivalent to proving the lower and upper semi-
continuity of ψ(θ). Speciﬁcally, we need to show that for any θ∈Θ and sequence {θk} ⊆Θ,θk→θ,
we have
ψ(θ)≤liminf
k→∞ψ(θk) andψ(θ)≥limsup
k→∞ψ(θk).
First, we show that ψ(θ)≤liminf
k→∞ψ(θk). Sinceh(λ−,θ) is continuous and Γ is closed and bounded,
8for any{θk}, there exists sequence {λk
−}such that
h(λk
−,θk) =ψ(θk).
According to the deﬁnition of ψ, we have
ψ(θ)≤h(λk
−,θ) =h(λk
−,θ)−h(λk
−,θk)+ψ(θk).
Furthermore, by the continuity of h(λ−,θ), we obtain
ψ(θ)≤liminf
k→∞ψ(θk),
which gives the lower semi-continuity of ψ(θ) atθ.
Now, we show that ψ(θ)≥limsup
k→∞ψ(θk). Sinceh(λ−,θ) is continuous on closed and bounded set Γ,
for a given θ, there exists λ−∈Γ such that
h(λ−,θ) =ψ(θ).
Since Γ is dense-in-itself, there exists a sequence {λk
−} ⊆Γ,λk
−→λ−. By the continuity of h(λ−,θ),
ψ(θ) =h(λ−,θ) = limsup
k→∞h(λk
−,θk)≥limsup
k→∞ψ(θk),
which gives the upper semi-continuity of ψ(θ) atθ. Therefore, ψ(θ) is continuous at θ.
In the following analysis, we separately study the inﬂuence of three types of market parameters. For
each type of parameters, we will isolate its eﬀect by holding the othe r parameters constant. We ﬁrst
focus on the inﬂuence of market shares.
Proposition 2. (i) In the market dominated by the noise investor, i.e., αN→1−, if estimation λC
−
solves(PC), thenλC
−solves(PB). (ii) In the market dominated by the informed investor, i.e. ,αI→1−,
if estimation λC
−solves(PC), thenλC
−solves(PF).

and the inequality uses the optimality of λC

which reduces to a trivial case since the objective function is a cons tant independent of λ−and the

which is the mean vector of the prior distribution of expected retur ns inBlack and Litterman (1992).
We then focus on the inﬂuence of the noise trading intensity. Denot eσmin= min{σ1,...,σ n}and
σmax= max{σ1,...,σ n}as the minimum and maximum noise trading intensity, respectively.

Remark 2.3. If the risk-aversioncoeﬃcient of informed investors tends to zer o, the combined estimation
and forward-looking estimation of excess expected returns tend to zero, which corresponds to a risk-
neutral world. With Equation ( 9), we have
lim
δI→0+µC= lim
δI→0+µF= lim
δI→0+δI
αIΣ(xM−αUx∗
U−αNxN) = 0.
In summary, Proposition 2to Proposition 4indicate that the combined estimation is closer to the
forward-lookingestimation in marketswherethe marketshareoft he informed investoris higher, the noise
trading intensity is lower, or the risk aversion degree of informed tr aders is lower. In these markets, the
informed investor plays a more dominant role, hence the market por tfolio is more heavily inﬂuenced by
the informed trader and eﬃcient forward-looking information can b e recovered. Conversely, in markets
where the market portfolio is dominated by the less-informed invest orand the noise investor, the forward-
looking information is invalid hence the combined estimation tends to be closer to the backward-looking
estimation. Therefore, Proposition 2to Proposition 4demonstrate the self-adaptivity of the proposed
combined estimation.
2.4 Explicit form of combined estimation for a special case
The portfolio decision is usually more sensitive to the mean vector tha n the covariance matrix. In this
section, we mainly focus on mean estimation and assume that the cov ariance matrix can be exactly
estimated by historical data, i.e., Σ U= ΣI= Σ. We also assume the homogeneous risk aversion for the
informed and the less-informed investor, i.e., δU=δI=δ. Denote
q0/definesαUx∗
U+αI(δΣ)−1µmandP/definesαI(δΣ)−1(µ1−µm,...,µm−1−µm).
Then, we can rewrite ( 9) as
xM=q0+Pλ−+ε,
andF1(λ−) andF2(λ−|θ) becomes
F1(λ−) =/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleλ−−ˆλ−/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2

where I m−1is an (m−1)×(m−1) identical matrix. Problem (P C) can be rewritten as

Φ−1+∝bardblxM−q0−Pλ−∝bardbl2

s.t.Gλ−≤h.
The following proposition gives the explicit form of the combined estima tion.
Proposition 5. Suppose that λ−∼ N/parenleftBig
ˆλ−,Φ/parenrightBig
andxM∼ N(q0+Pλ−,Ω)and both ΦandΩare
invertible. Then, there exists ν∗≥0, such that the combined estimation λC

whereν∗satisﬁes

Proof.Note that
F1(λ−)+F2(λ−|θ)∝/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleλ−−Λ−1κ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2
Λ,
where Λ /definesΦ−1+P′Ω−1Pandκ/definesΦ−1ˆλ−+P′Ω−1(xM−q0). Hence, problem (P C) is equivalent to
min
λ−∈Γ/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleλ−−Λ−1κ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2
Λ
which is a convex quadratic program, and the corresponding Lagra ngian function is deﬁned as
L(λ−,ν)/defines/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleλ−−Λ−1κ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2
Λ+ν′(Gλ−−h),
whereνis the Lagrangian multiplier vector for the inequality constraints. It is clear that there exists an
interior point in feasible set Γ; hence, there exist λC
−∈Γ andν∗≥0 satisfying the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker
(KKT) conditions ( Boyd and Vandenberghe ,2004)
2Λ(λC
−−Λ−1κ)+G′ν∗= 0,
ν∗′(GλC
−−h) = 0.
By the convexity of problem (P C),λC
−is a optimal solution.
Proposition 5shows that if λC
−=/parenleftbig
Φ−1+P′Ω−1P/parenrightbig−1/parenleftBig
Φ−1ˆλ−+P′Ω−1(xM−q0)/parenrightBig
is an interior
point of Γ, then we have ν∗=0from the complementary slackness and λC
−is optimal to problem (P C).
Therefore, we can also solve the combined estimation by Bayesianes timation. With the priordistribution
and forward-looking information, the posterior distribution is still a normal distribution
λ−|xM∼ N/parenleftBig/parenleftbig

Φ−1+P′Ω−1P/parenrightbig−1/parenrightBig
.
15The proof is given in the Appendix. Since the mean and mode of a norma l distribution are equal, the
mean of the posterior distribution is the same as the maximum a poste rior estimation in problem (P C).
Notably, the mathematical expression for the posterior mean
/parenleftbig
Φ−1+P′Ω−1P/parenrightbig−1/parenleftBig
Φ−1ˆλ−+P′Ω−1(xM−q0)/parenrightBig
is the same as in Black and Litterman (1992) andZhu et al. (2014) in form. Here, we highlight the
diﬀerences between this work and theirs. In the Black-Litterman m odel, the prior distribution and
investor views focus directly on expected returns, while the forwa rd-looking information in this paper is
indirectly related to expected returns and the covariance matrix t hrough mixture weights. Additionally,
in extracting market-implied information, we consider a more genera l equilibrium with three types of
investors, while they simply impose assumptions of perfect rationalit y and homogeneous expectation.
Compared to Zhu et al. (2014), who also model the asset returns with the Gaussian mixture distr ibution,
the present model has fundamental diﬀerences in the information for estimating the mixture weights.
Their approach focuses on incorporating investors’ views, while we study the market equilibrium to
extract market-implied information.
Remark 2.4. Recall that we analyze how model parameters inﬂuence the combine d estimation in sub-
section2.3, here, we verify Proposition 2to Proposition 4in an explicit form. Take the inﬂuence of noise
intensityσminas an example.

which is optimal to problem (P B), consistent with Proposition 3. For this special case, the inﬂuences
of other parameters can be also veriﬁed explicitly, and we can easily o bserve the self-adaptivity of the
combined estimation.
3 Simulations
In this section, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to conﬁrm the se lf-adaptive capabilities of the
combined estimation discussed in subsection 2.3and show the signiﬁcance of information integration in
forecasting. To do so, we ﬁrst introduce the parameter settings and sample generation, then compare the
predictive eﬀects of the three types of estimations.
Returnsamplesaregeneratedbasedonthe Gaussianmixture distr ibution, wherediﬀerentcomponents
canbeinterpretedasdiﬀerentmarketstatesandmixtureweights aretheprobabilitiesofthecorresponding
states. Following Zhu et al. (2014), we takem= 3 components, representing the bull, oscillator, and bear
markets, and n= 10 risky assets in the experiments. The total length of the exper iment period is 400
days, divided into four segments of length 200, 80, 50, and 70 days . The mixture coeﬃcients of the four
segments are described as λ1= (0,0.5,0.5)′,λ2= (0.7,0.3,0)′,λ3= (0,0.5,0.5)′andλ4= (0.2,0.8,0)′,
respectively.1We begin our experiment on day 111, and the three representative investors rebalance their

and elements of βkare the samples of 1 .2−0.6τ, whereτ∼ N(0,1). The diagonal elements of Var(εk)
are the samples of 0 .002˜τ, where ˜τ∼ U(0,1). The above-mentioned τand ˜τare independent of each
other. With mixture coeﬃcients and the density function Equation ( 7), we can generate samples of asset
returns in four investment segments. The risk-free return is set asrf= 3.5%.
Then, we generate samples of the market portfolio. According to ( 6), the market portfolio is a
linear combination of the holdings of the three types of investors. T he informed investor knows the true

the EM algorithm ( McLachlan and Krishnan ,2007) with a ∆t= 30-day rolling estimation window. Both
informed and less-informed investors determine their portfolios by solving ( 2). In addition, the holdings

Figure 2: Comparisons of true values, backward-looking, combined , and forward-lookingestimations. We
show the results in four typical markets, including a nearly complete ly eﬀective market ( αI,0= 0.990),
an almost ineﬀective market ( αI,0= 0.001), and two relatively eﬃcient markets ( αI,0= 0.300,0.600).
19Table1reports the RMSE of three types of estimations. First, we explore the impact of model
parameters discussed in subsection 2.3. It is clear that the RMSE of the backward-looking estimation
ηBin all market settings remains unchanged, while the RMSE of the comb ined estimation and forward-
looking estimation vary with market parameters. In a market that is dominated by the informed investor
(αI,0= 0.990,σ= 2.603×10−5, orδI= 2.777×10−3), both the combined estimation and the forward-
looking estimation are close to the true value with RMSE ηC=ηF≈0. In markets where the market
information is completely noisy ( αI,0= 0.001,σ= 2.603×103, orδI= 2.250×103), the forward-
looking estimation exhibits larger errors, while the combined estimatio n is close to the backward-looking
estimation with a smaller RMSE. For other market settings, the comb ined estimation shows similar
prediction pattern. It is closer to the forward-looking estimation if αI,0is higher,σis lower, or δI
is lower, and vice versa. In addition, the combined estimation usually h as a lower RMSE than the
backward-looking one.
Second, we focus on the prediction power at turning points. Figure 2shows the true mixture coef-
ﬁcients and the three estimations in four diﬀerent markets by sett ingαI,0to 0.001, 0.300, 0.600, and
0.990. Together with the RMSE at turning points shown in Table 1, we observe that the backward-
looking approach lags in prediction when the market state changes, consistent with Zhu et al. (2014).
As expected, the forward-looking and combined approaches can r espond more quickly in markets with
eﬃcient forward-looking information. As the informed investor’s ma rket shareαI,0decreases, the mar-
ket becomes less eﬃcient, and the accuracy of forward-looking es timation and combined estimation also
decreases.
Overall,theforward-lookingapproachperformsbetterineﬃcient markets,whilethebackward-looking
approach is able to provide relatively reasonable estimation in extrem ely ineﬃcient markets. However,
for partially informative markets, the combined approach provides the highest accuracy in prediction,
highlighting its robustness and self-adaptivity in integrating diﬀeren t sources of information.
4 Empirical study
In this section, we compare the out-of-sample performance of inv estment strategies determined by three
types of estimations on 35 major stock markets over the world.
4.1 Data description
We select 35 constituent markets in the MSCI ACWI Index,2each of which has a complete time series of
returns covering more than ten years. Weekly returns, volatility in dices, and market capitalization data
of primary sector indices are obtained from the Bloomberg databas e. Volatility indices are obtained to
measure the risk-aversion coeﬃcients.3To proxy for the market shares of diﬀerent investors, we obtain
the market value ratio of institutional investors from the exchang e websites.4Risk-free returns for each

3For markets without option traded, we proxy the volatility i ndex using EURO STOXX 50 volatility (VSTOXX), CBOE
EFA ETF volatility index (VXEFA), or CBOE emerging markets E TF volatility index (VXEEM) according to their regions
and market types.
4For markets that do not disclose this ratio, we use the indica tors of markets with similar economic development levels
as substitutes.
20market are proxied by 3-month treasury yields, interbank-oﬀere d rates, or central bank rates.
Table2lists the detailed descriptionofthe datawhere DM representsthe d evelopedmarket, while EM
denotes the emerging market. Table 3reports the descriptive statistics including the number of industry
sectors, mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of in dex excess returns. Consistent with the
existing literature, the excess returns is left-skewed and heavy- tailed, which highlights the signiﬁcance of
modeling asset returns with the Gaussian mixture distribution.

224.2 Empirical setting
We ﬁrst introduce the settings of market parameters. The marke t shareαI,0of the informed investor
at time 0 is set as the market share of institutional investors. In ad dition, we simply set the market
share of the noise investor as αN,0= 0.100 and the initial market share of the less-informed investor as
αU,0= 1−αI,0−αN,0.The updating of the market shares of the three types of investor s is in line with
simulation studies.
Withrespecttonoiseintensity,weassumethatmarketswithahighe rshareoftheinformedinvestorex-
hibitlowernoisetradingintensity. Weassign95%conﬁdenceintervals of[−1,1],[−2,2],[−3,3],[−4,4],[−5,5]
to the noise investor’s holding in markets with informed investor shar es of 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2. The
market shares of informed investorsand noise trading intensities o f the 35 markets are listed in the second
and third columns of Table 3.
To more eﬀectively characterize the behavior of investors in the re al world, we introduce a volatility
index-based time-varying risk aversion coeﬃcient for the informed investor, as the risk-neutral volatility

i=t−∆t+1VIXi,
whereδ0= 2.500,VIXtis the volatility index in the corresponding market, and ∆ t= 100 weeks. The
risk-aversion coeﬃcient of the less-informed investor is set as δU= 2.500.
Now we introduce the setting of the mixture components. We set m= 4 Gaussian components, in-
cluding three determined by the historicaldata and one derivedacc ordingto Black and Litterman (1992).
The three historical data related components are estimated using the return data before January 2012
and remain unchanged in the investment period, which characterize the excess return in bull, oscillating,
and bear markets, respectively.5The selection of component associated with the prior distribution of
Black and Litterman (1992) aims to better utilize the forward-lookinginformation. Speciﬁcally, this com-
ponent is determined according to the market portfolio as N(δI,tˆΣtxM,t,ˆΣt), where ˆΣtis the covariance
matrix dynamically estimated with the latest 100-week historical dat a by rolling windows.
4.3 Empirical results
We compute three types of mixture weights based on Deﬁntion 1and obtain corresponding estimations
for the mean vector and covariancematrix with ( 8). Then, we input these estimations into mean-variance
optimization ( 1) and obtain the backward-lookingstrategy, forward-lookingstr ategy, and combined strat-
egy, respectively.
The out-of-sample investment period is from January 2012 to Nove mber 2020. Short-selling is not
allowed and we only consider the allocation within risky assets ( DeMiguel et al. ,2013). For robustness,
we rebalance the portfolio every month, quarter, and half a year, and a 100-week rolling window is
adopted. We also set the risk-aversion coeﬃcients as 0 .3δI,t,δI,tand 3δI,t, corresponding to aggressive,
5To do so, we compute the percentage rise (fall) of the index ba sed on the highest and lowest value. A period is classﬁes
as a bull market if the percentage rise is greater than 90%, a b ear market if the percentage fall is less than -50%, and an
oscillating market if the excess return is close to zero.

We calculate indicators including average (across rebalancing window ) annualized Sharpe ratio (SR),
turnover rate (TRN) ( DeMiguel et al. ,2013), and maximum drawdown (MDD) ( Chekhlov et al. ,2005)
to evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the strategies

We set the transaction cost ratio as c= 0.5% (DeMiguel et al. ,2009). An outperforming portfolio usually
has a higher SR, a lower TRN, and a lower MDD.

results of markets where the backward-looking strategy perfor ms the best, Panel B reports the results
of markets where the combined strategy performs the best, and Panel C shows the results of markets
where the forward-looking strategy performs the best. We also p lot the SR of the optimal mean-variance
portfolio for each market in Figure 3for a more intuitive exhibition.
Most markets reported in Panel A are the emerging markets with low erαI,0(0.200-0.400) such as
Mexico and Thailand, while most markets reported in Panel C are deve loped markets with higher αI,0
(0.500-0.600) such as the US and Germany, which shows that backw ard (forward)-looking estimation
predicts better in emerging (developed) markets. An intuitive expla nation is that in an eﬃcient market,
it is diﬃcult to predict future returns with historical data, and the m arket portfolio is close to the optimal
portfolio. In contrast, in emerging markets, the forward-looking information in the market portfolio is
less valuable due to the noise trader, and backward-looking informa tion plays a more important role in
investment.
The combined strategy achieves the best out-of-sample perform ance in a wide range of markets, as
shown in Panel B. An interesting ﬁnding is that in developed markets s uch as Germany and Switzerland,
the combined strategy is similar to the forward-looking strategies, while the combined strategy is similar
to the backward-looking strategy in emerging markets such as Sou th Africa and Thailand. In addition,
in markets shown in Panels A and C, the performance of the combined strategy is closer to the best
strategy. These pieces of evidence show that our combined strat egy can adaptively integrate diﬀerent
sources of information based on market characteristics.

Figure 3: Sharpe ratio (SR) of the optimal mean-variance portfolio for each market. The horizontal axis
indicates the market share of informed investors at time 0.
Overall, although the backward (forward)-looking strategy has b etter performance in some emerging
(developed) markets, the combined strategy outperforms in a wid er range of markets, as shown in Panel
B. Even if in markets reported in Panels A and C, the combined strate gy is close to the best strategy
and does not behave the worst, which conﬁrms its ﬂexibility and adap tivity. Therefore, our combined
strategy shows the potential of improving portfolio out-of-samp le performance.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel combined approach to estimate t he future returns of assets and test
the out-of-sample performance of investment decisions. The for ecasting work is based on a heterogeneous
market model with an informed investor, a less-informed investor, and a noise trader, and we derive the
market equilibrium according to the decision behavior of investors. B y the Gaussian mixture model, we
extract forward-looking information from the market portfolio in t he spirit of inverse optimization. With
the historical prior, we maximize the posterior probability and obtain the combined estimation.
The combined estimation is inﬂuenced by three market characterist ics including the market share of
diﬀerent investors, the intensity of noise trading, and the risk-av ersion attitude of the informed investor.
We show through both theoretical analysis and simulation experimen ts that the combined approach
exhibits self-adaptability in integrating diﬀerent sources of informa tion according to the degree of market
eﬃciency. Empirical analyses across 35 constituent markets of th e MSCI ACWI Index are performed.
26While the backward-looking (forward-looking) strategy has bette r performance in emerging (developed)
markets, we show that the combined strategy can be well applied to a wider range of stock markets, not
limited to emerging or developed markets.
In summary, we attempt to provide a new research paradigm for re turn forecast in portfolio manage-
ment. Note that neither the marketportfolio northe Gaussianmixt ure model in this paper is unalterable;
in fact, our research paradigm can also be applied to other market v ariables containing expectation in-
formation, other statistical method used to model asset return s, and even the framework other than
mean-variance analysis. Uncovering more eﬀective forecasting inf ormation from ﬁnancial markets and
generating more robust and practical optimal portfolios remains a longstanding issue in both practical
portfolio management and academic research on portfolio theory.

6.1 Posterior distribution in the special case
The following proposition gives an explicit posterior distribution of λ−.
Proposition 6. Suppose λ−∼ N/parenleftBig
ˆλ−,Φ/parenrightBig
,xM=q0+Pλ−+εwhereε∼ N(0n,Ω)andCov(λ−,ε) =
0. IfΦandΩare invertible, then the conditional distribution of λ−for given xMbecomes
λ−|xM∼ N/parenleftBig/parenleftbig
Φ−1+P′Ω−1P/parenrightbig−1/parenleftBig
Φ−1ˆλ−+P′Ω−1(xM−q0)/parenrightBig

Proof.With Bayes’ rule, we can rewrite the posterior probability as
λ−|xM∝p(xM|λ−)p(λ−)
