Abstract
(1+1)-dimensional locally de Sitter Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies
with compact spatial sections allow cosh, sinh and exponential evolution laws,
each with a freely-specifiable spatial circumference parameter, and the value of
this parameter has an invariant geometric meaning for the cosh and sinh evo-
lution laws. We identify geometrically preferred states for a quantised massive
scalar field on these cosmologies, some singled out by adiabatic criteria in the dis-
tant past, with an ambiguity remaining due to a massive zero mode, and others
induced from the Euclidean vacuum on standard (1 + 1)-dimensional de Sitter
space by a quotient construction. We show that a comoving quantum observer,
modelled as an Unruh-DeWitt detector, can distinguish these states from the Eu-
clidean vacuum on standard de Sitter space. Numerical plots are given in selected
parameter regimes. We also evaluate the field’s stress-energy tensor expectation
value for those states that are induced from the Euclidean vacuum by a quotient
construction.

1arXiv:2304.10395v2  [gr-qc]  17 Jan 20241 Introduction
(d+ 1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, dSd+1, admits for all d≥1 foliations as a
spatially homogeneous Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology where the scale
factor as a function of the cosmological time is a hyperbolic cosine, a hyperbolic sine, or
an exponential. The case of four spacetime dimensions, d= 3, is described in [1], and
the generalisation to any d≥1 is straightforward. For the cosh scale factor the foliation
is global on dSd+1, whereas for the sinh and exp scale factors the foliation covers only
part of dSd+1. For a quantised massive scalar field, the Euclidean vacuum in dSd+1[2–6]
hence induces on each of these cosmologies a quantum state, and to any local quantum
observer this state is indistinguishable from the Euclidean vacuum on dSd+1.
In this paper we address how the situation changes when these FRW foliations of
de Sitter are generalised to FRW cosmologies that are still locally de Sitter but have a
compact spatial topology, even for the sinh and exp scale factors. Are there geometrically
distinguished quantum states, and can a local quantum observer, modelled as an Unruh-
DeWitt (UDW) detector [5, 7, 8], operationally distinguish them from the Euclidean
vacuum on de Sitter? In 3+1 dimensions, spatial quotients of this type have sometimes
been explored as a possible description of our own Universe [9,10].
We specialise to 1+1 spacetime dimensions, for two reasons. First, from the absence
of spatial intrinsic curvature in 1 + 1 dimensions it follows that the spatially compact
locally de Sitter FRW spacetimes can be classified by a spatial circumference parameter
that can take arbitrary positive values, for each of the cosh, sinh and exp scale factors; for
the exp scale factor the spatial circumference parameter has no geometrically invariant
magnitude, but for the cosh and sinh scale factors it does, as we shall review in Section 3.
We emphasise that the only one of these spacetimes that is a subset of dS1+1is the global
foliation of dS1+1, given by the cosh scale factor with the standard spatial circumference:
none of the others is globally isometric to dS1+1or to any of its subsets.
The second reason to specialise to 1+1 dimensions is that a pointlike UDW detector
operating for a finite time at constant coupling encounters then no singularities in its
response, to leading order in perturbation theory, as we shall review in Section 5. This
will simplify the technical input needed to localise the detector in time.
Our main outcome is to present a selection of geometrically distinguished sets of
quantum states for these locally de Sitter cosmologies, and to show that a comoving
observer can use their local quantum equipment to establish that these states differ
from the Euclidean vacuum in dS1+1.
For the sinh and exp scale factor spacetimes, we consider the vacuum that is adiabatic
in the past, which is a criterion often adopted in the (3 + 1) context for describing our
own Universe [11]; for the exp scale factor spacetime without spatial periodicity, this
criterion would in fact give the standard Euclidean vacuum [4, 5]. The distant past
adiabatic criterion is however inapplicable to the spatially constant field mode that
appears due to the spatial compactness, because of a phenomenon known as a massive
zero mode [12,13]. We describe a possible alternative way to choose the quantum state
of the spatially constant field mode by appealing to the late-time behaviour.
2For the cosh scale factor spacetimes, we consider the adiabatic large momentum
vacuum that mimics the Euclidean vacuum, and is in fact induced from the Euclidean
vacuum by a quotient construction when spatial circumference parameter takes those
special values for which the spacetime is a Zpquotient of standard de Sitter, with
p= 2,3. . ..
For the sinh scale factor spacetimes, we also consider, in addition to the adiabatic
vacuum, a state induced from the Euclidean vacuum by a quotient construction, allow-
ing a straightforward method-of-images construction of the Wightman function. When
described in the Fock space formalism adapted to the cosmological evolution, this state
is however not pure but mixed, much like the Minkowski vacuum in a single Rindler
wedge appears as as a thermal state with respect to the Rindler time evolution [5,7].
In all of these situations, we find the response of a comoving UDW detector, either
as a mode sum or as a double integral involving a hypergeometric function. We present
selected numerical results.
For comparison, we also evaluate the scalar field’s stress-energy tensor in those states
that come from the Euclidean vacuum by a quotient construction, in terms of image
sums involving a hypergeometric function. These image sums provide a starting point
for surveying the parameter space for the stress-energy tensor by analytic asymptotic
methods and by numerical methods.
The structure of the paper is as follows. We start in Section 2 with a brief review
of a quantised real massive scalar field in (1 + 1)-dimensional spatially compact FRW
spacetimes, establishing the notation and the conventions. Section 3 describes the ge-
ometry of the three distinct types of locally de Sitter 1 + 1 spacetimes that are FRW
cosmologies with compact spatial sections. Section 4 presents our choices for the state
of the quantum field, and the formulas for the response of a comoving UDW detector
are given in Section 5. The image sum formulas for the stress-energy tensor are given in
Section 6. Section 7 describes the outcomes of selected numerical simulations, delegating
the associated plots to an appendix. Section 8 gives a brief summary and concluding
remarks.
We use units in which ℏ=c= 1. The geometry conventions follow those in [5],
having ds2>0 for timelike separations. Complex conjugation is denoted by an asterisk,
except in selected long expressions where it is denoted by an overline.
2 Massive scalar field in spatially compact (1 + 1)
FRW spacetimes
In this section we briefly review the quantisation of a real massive scalar field in (1 +
1)-dimensional spatially compact FRW spacetimes, setting out the notation and the
conventions, which follow those in [13].
32.1 Spacetime and the field equation
We consider spacetimes with the line element
ds2=dt2−a2(t)dx2=C(η)(dη2−dx2), (2.1)
where the scale factor a(t) is assumed positive, the cosmological time tand the conformal
time ηare related by dη/dt = 1/a(t), and C(η) =a2 
t(η)
.Cis by assumption positive,
and we assume it to be smooth in η. We further assume xto be periodic with period
L > 0, so that ( t, x)∼(t, x+L), or ( η, x)∼(η, x+L). The constant ηsurfaces are
hence topologically circles, and the spacetime has topology R×S1.
We take tandato have the physical dimension of length. It follows that ηandx
are dimensionless and Chas the physical dimension of length squared. This convention
will be useful with the locally de Sitter metrics introduced in Section 3.
On these spacetimes, we consider a real scalar field ϕwith mass m > 0 and the
action
S=1
2Z
(∂ηϕ)2−(∂xϕ)2−˜µ2(η)ϕ2
dη dx , (2.2)
where
˜µ(η) := 
C(η)(m2+ξR)1/2, (2.3)
Ris the Ricci scalar, ξis the curvature coupling constant, and we assume the parameters
to be such that ˜ µis positive. The field equation is the Klein-Gordon equation,
∂2
∂η2−∂2
∂x2+ ˜µ2(η)
ϕ(η, x) = 0 , (2.4)
where ˜ µacts as an η-dependent effective mass.
We assume ϕto be a single-valued field on the spacetime, periodic in the local
coordinate xwith period L. (A generalisation to a Z2-twisted field is considered in [13].)
We may hence separate the field equation (2.4) with the normal mode ansatz
Un(η, x) =L−1/2χn(η) exp( iknx), (2.5)
where
kn:= 2πn/L , n ∈Z, (2.6)
finding that mode function χnsatisfies the differential equation
χ′′
n(η) +ω2
n(η)χn(η) = 0 , (2.7)
4where the prime denotes derivative with respect to ηand
ωn(η) := 
k2
n+ ˜µ2(η)1/2. (2.8)
We require the mode functions to satisfy the Wronskian condition
W[χn, χ∗
n] :=χnχ′∗
n−χ∗
nχ′
n=i , (2.9)
which implies that the normal modes Un(2.5) are a positive norm orthonormal set in
the Klein-Gordon inner product,
(Un, Un′) :=iZL
0dx(U∗
n∂ηUn′−Un′∂ηU∗
n) =δnn′. (2.10)
2.2 Field quantisation
Given a choice of the mode functions χn, we quantise the field in a standard manner,
expanding the field operator ˆϕas
ˆϕ(η, x) =X
n
Un(η, x)ˆan+h.c.
, (2.11)
where the nonvanishing commutators of the annihilation and creation operators are

ˆan,ˆa†
m
=δn,m 1. (2.12)
ˆϕ(η, x) and its conjugate momentum ˆ π(η, x) =∂
∂ηˆϕ(η, x) then satisfy the canonical
commutation relations,
h
ˆϕ(η, x),ˆπ(η, x′)i
=iδx,x′ 1, (2.13)
where δx,x′is the periodic Dirac delta-function.
The Hilbert space is a Fock space built on the Fock vacuum |0⟩, satisfying an|0⟩= 0
for all n. The Wightman function, G(η, x;η′, x′) =⟨0|ˆϕ(η, x)ˆϕ(η′, x′)|0⟩, decomposes as
G(η, x;η′, x′) =G0(η;η′) +Gosc(η, x;η′, x′), (2.14a)
G0(η;η′) =1
Lχ0(η)χ∗
0(η′), (2.14b)
Gosc(η, x;η′, x′) =1
LX
n̸=0χn(η)χ∗
n(η′)eikn(x−x′). (2.14c)
The mode functions χncan often be chosen by requiring them to have the adiabatic
5asymptotic form [5,11,14,15],
χn(η)−→1p
2ωn(η)exp
−iZη
ωn(η′)dη′
, (2.15)
where ωn(η) is slowly varying in a suitable technical sense. The sense of asymptotic may
refer to a future/past region, η→ ±∞ , or to large momenta, |n| → ∞ . The vacuum
state that ensues is interpreted physically as a no-particle state for a local observer,
respectively in the asymptotic region, or for the asymptotically large momenta.
We shall encounter spacetimes with an asymptotic past region, η→ −∞ , in which
C(η)→0 in such a way that mode functions with the adiabatic form (2.15) exist for
n̸= 0 but not for n= 0. An n= 0 mode with this property is known as a massive zero
mode [12].
3 Locally de Sitter FRW spacetimes
In this section we review the geometry of (1+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime, adapt-
ing the (3 + 1)-dimensional discussion of [1], and introducing coordinate charts whose
generalisation will then lead to three distinct families of spatially compact locally but
not globally de Sitter FRW spacetimes.
3.1 de Sitter spacetime
(1 + 1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime dS2can be defined as the hyperboloid
−H−2=T2−X2−Y2, (3.1)
embedded in (2+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime with global coordinates ( T, X, Y )
and the metric
ds2=dT2−dX2−dY2, (3.2)
where His a positive parameter of dimension inverse length. dS2is a maximally sym-
metric spacetime, with the isometry group O(2,1) inherited from the ambient Minkowski
space, and with the positive Ricci scalar R= 2H2, showing that His the inverse of the
Gaussian curvature radius. dS2is globally hyperbolic, with spatial topology S1, and a
globalR×S1foliation is provided by the spacelike circles of constant T.
For later convenience, we define [6,16]
Z(x,x′) :=−H2ηabXa(x)Xb(x′), (3.3)
where xand x′denote points in dS2,Xa(x) and Xb(x′) are the corresponding three-
dimensional Minkowski coordinates, and ηabis the ambient Minkowski metric (3.2).
6This real quadratic form is clearly invariant under the de Sitter group O(2,1), and it
has the properties that Z(x,x′)>1 if ( x,x′) are timelike separated, Z(x,x′) = 1 if ( x,x′)
are null separated and Z(x,x′)<1 if ( x,x′) are spacelike separated. Further discussion
is given in [6,16].
We now consider three different coordinate charts, adapted to different subgroups of
theO(2,1) isometry group, and use them to construct three distinct families of spatially
compact locally but not globally de Sitter FRW spacetimes.
3.2 Cosh scale factor spacetime
The first chart of interest on dS2is (t, χ), in which
T=H−1sinh(Ht), X =H−1cosh( Ht) cosχ, Y =H−1cosh( Ht) sinχ , (3.4)
where −∞< t < ∞and ( t, χ)∼(t, χ+ 2π). This chart covers all of dS2, and is often
called the global chart. The metric reads
ds2=dt2−H−2cosh2(Ht)dχ2. (3.5)
Introducing the conformal time ηas in (2.1), we have
η:= 2 arctan 
eHt
, (3.6)
where 0 < η < π , and
ds2= (Hsinη)−2(dη2−dχ2). (3.7)
The spacelike circles of constant ηare the circles of constant Tin (3.1).
We shall consider the metric (3.7) where χis periodic with period λ∈(0,∞), not
necessarily equal to 2 π. Geometrically, this means first passing to the universal covering
space of dS2and then taking the quotient by the discrete group generated by the spatial
translation ( η, χ)7→(η, χ+λ), coming from the rotational Killing vector X∂Y−Y ∂Xof
the embedding spacetime. We refer to this spacetime as the cosh scale factor spacetime.
We shall be especially interested in the cases where λ= 2π/p,p= 1,2, . . ., where
p= 1 is normal dS2andp= 2,3, . . .are its Zpquotients; the quotient with p= 2 was
preferred by de Sitter in the (3 + 1)-dimensional context [17,18]. For the case λ= 4π,
which is the double cover of normal dS2, a real scalar field has been considered in [19],
by the techniques developed for normal dS2in [20–22], and a complex automorphic field
has been considered in [23].
73.3 Sinh scale factor spacetime
A second chart of interest on dS2is (t1, χ1), in which
T=H−1sinh(Ht1) cosh χ1, X =H−1sinh(Ht1) sinh χ1, Y =H−1cosh( Ht1),
(3.8)
where 0 < t1<∞andχ1∈R. This chart covers the part of dS2where Y > 1/Hand
T=p
X2+ (Y2−H−2), so that in particular T >|X|. The metric reads
ds2=dt2
1−H−2sinh2(Ht1)dχ2
1. (3.9)
Introducing the conformal time η1as in (2.1), we have
η1:= ln 
tanh( Ht1/2)
, (3.10)
where −∞< η 1<0, and
ds2= (Hsinhη1)−2(dη2
1−dχ2
1). (3.11)
The spacelike curves of constant η1are the hyperbolas T=p
X2+ (Y2−H−2) in the
timelike planes of constant Y >1/H.
The coordinates ( t1, χ1) are similar to the Milne coordinates in the future quadrant
of (1+1) Minkowski spacetime, and the coordinate singularity at t1→0+, orη1→ −∞ ,
is similar to the singularity of the Milne coordinates on the Minkowski light cone [5,13].
We shall consider the metric (3.11) where χ1is periodic with period λ1∈(0,∞).
Geometrically, this means taking the quotient by the group generated by the transla-
tion ( η1, χ1)7→(η1, χ1+λ1), coming from the boost Killing vector X∂T+T∂Xof the
embedding spacetime. We refer to this spacetime as the sinh scale factor spacetime.
3.4 Exp scale factor spacetime
A third chart of interest on dS2is (t0, χ0), in which
T=H−1sinh(Ht0) +1
2H−1χ2
0exp(Ht0), (3.12a)
X=H−1χ0exp(Ht0), (3.12b)
Y=H−1cosh( Ht0)−1
2H−1χ2
0exp(Ht0), (3.12c)
where −∞< t0<∞andχ0∈R. This chart covers the part of dS2where T+Y > 0.
The metric reads
ds2=dt2
0−H−2e2Ht0dχ2
0. (3.13)
8Introducing the conformal time η0as in (2.1), we have
η0:=−e−Ht0, (3.14)
where −∞< η 0<0, and
ds2= (Hη0)−2(dη2
0−dχ2
0). (3.15)
The spacelike curves of constant η0are the parabolas T−Y= (X2−H−2)/(T+Y) in
the null planes of constant T+Y >0.
The coordinates ( t0, χ0) have a coordinate singularity at t0→ −∞ , orη0→ −∞ ,
atT+Y= 0. The higher-dimensional version of these coordinates are known as the
spatially flat coordinates in de Sitter [1], much employed in cosmology [11].
We shall consider the metric (3.15) where χ0is periodic with period λ0∈(0,∞).
Geometrically, this means taking the quotient by the group generated by the translation
(η0, χ0)7→(η0, χ0+λ0), coming from the null rotation Killing vector ( X∂T+T∂X)−
(X∂Y−Y ∂X) of the embedding spacetime. We refer to this spacetime as the exp scale
factor spacetime.
The value of the parameter λ0∈(0,∞) has no geometrically invariant meaning: any
other value ˜λ0∈(0,∞) gives an isometric spacetime, as can be seen from (3.15) by the
coordinate transformation
(η0, χ0) = (k˜η0, k˜χ0
, (3.16)
where k=λ0/˜λ0. This redundancy comes about because a null rotation in the em-
bedding Minkowski spacetime has no Lorentz-invariant magnitude, in contrast to the
rotation angle of a rotation and the rapidity parameter of a boost. In particular, we
could set λ0= 1 without loss of generality. We shall however keep λ0general as this will
give insight in the choice of the spatially constant mode state in Sections 4.3 and 5.4.
4 Quantum field in locally de Sitter FRW space-
times
In this section we consider the quantised scalar field in our three families of spatially
compact locally de Sitter FRW spacetimes. The key aim is to identify distinguished
vacuum states and to write down their Wightman functions.
We assume throughout m2+ 2ξH2>0, which makes the effective mass squared
in the Klein-Gordon equation strictly positive, and will in particular avoid the special
issues that arise with a massless minimally coupled scalar field [6,16,24]. We write
ν:=q
1
4−m2/H2−2ξ , (4.1)
9where we take the square root to be non-negative for 0 < m2/H2+ 2ξ≤1
4, in which
case 0 ≤ν <1
2, and positive imaginary for1
4< m2/H2+ 2ξ, in which case we write
ν=iαwith α=q
m2/H2+ 2ξ−1
4>0.
4.1 Cosh scale factor FRW
For the cosh scale factor spacetime (3.7), with χperiodic with period λ∈(0,∞), the
formalism of Section 2 applies with L=λandC(η) = (Hsinη)−2.
A pair of linearly independent solutions to the mode function differential equa-
tion (2.7) are√sinηPν

2+|kn|(−cosη) and√sinηQν

2+|kn|(−cosη), where Pν

2+|kn|and

2+|kn|are the associated Legendre functions on the cut, known in [25] as Ferrers
functions. We choose the linear combinations

,
(4.2)
which satisfy the Wronskian condition (2.9) by the Wronskian properties of the Ferrers
functions [25]. The phase convention in (4.2) covers the full range of νby one formula:
when 0 < ν <1
2, the factor e−iπν/2could be replaced by unity, and when ν=iαwith
α >0, the ratio of the gamma-functions could be replaced by unity, as this would only
affect the overall phase. We note in passing that the corresponding formula (5.74) in [5]
appears to contain a typographic error in the exponential factor.
An alternative expression for χn(4.2), found via the connection formulas on p168
of [26], is
χn(η) =e−iπ/4+i|kn|πq

where 2F1is the hypergeometric function [25]. At large |n|, (4.3) shows that χn(η)
reduce to the standard plane waves, exp( −i|kn|η)(2|kn|)−1/2, and the state defined by
these modes is in this sense an adiabatic vacuum at all times [5]. For λ= 2π, in
standard dS2, these modes define the state |0E⟩, known as the Euclidean, Chernikov-
Tagirov or Bunch-Davies vacuum [2–6].
The spacetime is not slowly expanding at early or late times, in the terminology of
Section 2.2, and there is no adiabatic in region or out region. For later use, we record
here that at late times, η→π−, the asymptotic behaviour of the modes (4.2) can be
found using the hypergeometric representations in §14.3 in [25]: with a convenient phase

where ψis the digamma function and γis the Euler-Mascheroni constant [25].
From now on we consider only standard dS2and its Zpquotients Mpin which
λ= 2π/p,p= 2,3, . . .. On Mp, the Wightman function in the vacuum |0p⟩defined by
the modes (4.2) can then be obtained from the Euclidean vacuum |0E⟩ondS2by the
method of images [27,28], as follows.
Recall first that the Euclidean vacuum Wightman function on dS2reads [4]

˜Tis any global time function on dS2, and the limit ϵ→0+is understood. The ϵ-
prescription specifies the analytic continuation of the hypergeometric function from Z<
1 toZ>1 across the logarithmic branch point at Z= 1, as follows from the Hadamard
property of |0E⟩, reviewed in [19,23].
Let now ( η, χ) be the coordinates in the metric (3.7) on standard dS2, with ( η, χ)∼
(η, χ+ 2π). On Mp, we may use the same coordinates but with the identification
(η, χ)∼(η, χ+ 2π/p). It then follows that

114.2 Sinh scale factor FRW
For the sinh scale factor spacetime (3.11), with χ1periodic with period λ1∈(0,∞), the
formalism of Section 2 applies with L=λ1andC(η1) = (Hsinhη1)−2.
A pair of linearly independent solutions to the mode function differential
equation (2.7) are a suitable choice of two fromp

2+i|kn|and
Q±ν

2+i|kn|are the associated Legendre functions at real argument greater than 1, in the
notation of [25], and the overline denotes the complex conjugate.
4.2.1 n̸= 0modes
Atη1→ −∞ , the n̸= 0 modes have an adiabatic “in” vacuum satisfying (2.15). The
mode functions are

as can be verified using 14.3.7 and 14.3.10 in [25]. An alternative expression, found via
connection formula 13 on p158 of [26], is
χin
n(η1) =eiφne−i|kn|η1

, (4.10)
where φnis a real-valued n-dependent phase constant, expressible in terms of Euler’s
gamma-function. At large |n|, (4.10) shows that the mode functions χin
n(η1) reduce
to the standard plane waves, exp( −i|kn|η1)(2|kn|)−1/2, and the state defined by these
modes is in this sense an adiabatic vacuum at all times.
Then̸= 0 “in” vacuum contribution to the Wightman function is given by (2.14c)
with (4.10) and L=λ1.
4.2.2 Zero momentum mode
The zero momentum mode is a massive zero mode at η1→ −∞ , and the early time
behaviour does not single out a distinguished mode function. We choose a distinguished
mode function by matching to the late time behaviour of the Euclidean vacuum modes
(4.15) and (4.16) with n= 0, while continuing to label these modes by the superscript
“in”: the outcome for ν̸= 0 is

to the Wightman function is given by (2.14b) with L=λ1.
4.2.3 Euclidean quotient state
We shall not attempt to define an “out” vacuum on the sinh scale factor FRW spacetime.
We shall however consider on the sinh scale factor FRW spacetime a state that can be
regarded as a minimal modification of the Euclidean vacuum on dS2: the state whose
Wightman function comes from that of the Euclidean vacuum by the periodic image
sum in χ1. We call this state the Euclidean quotient state.
Proceeding as with the finite quotients in Section 4.1, the Wightman function GEQ
in the Euclidean quotient state reads

, (4.13b)
where GdS2is given by (4.6) and (4.7). It follows from the embedding equations (3.8),
the definition (3.3) and the asymptotics of the hypergeometric function in (4.6) that
the sum in (4.13b) converges exponentially, making GEQwell defined. The coincidence
limit singularity of GEQis Hadamard because this singularity comes from GdS2.
The Euclidean quotient state is however not a pure state in the Fock space description
of Section 2.2. This is because dS2contains two opposing future sinh chart patches before
the periodic identification: the induced state on the union of the two patches contains
correlations between the two patches, much like the more familiar correlations between
the two opposing static coordinate patches [29], as can be analysed by extending the
future sinh chart techniques of [30] from their dS4/Z2context to the present context
ondS2.
We shall employ the image sum expression (4.13) in Sections 5 and 6 below.
4.3 Exp scale factor FRW
For the exp scale factor spacetime (3.15), with χ0periodic with period λ0∈(0,∞), the
formalism of Section 2 applies with L=λ0andC(η0) = (Hη0)−2.
Forkn̸= 0, a linearly independent pair of solutions to the mode function differential
equation (2.7) are√−η0H(1)
ν(−|kn|η0) and√−η0H(2)
ν(−|kn|η0), where H(1,2)
νare the
Hankel functions [25]. For kn= 0, a linearly independent pair is ( −η0)1
2±νwhen ν̸= 0,
and (−η0)1
2and (−η0)1
2ln(−η0) when ν= 0.
134.3.1 n̸= 0modes
Atη0→ −∞ , the n̸= 0 modes admit an adiabatic “in” form satisfying (2.15), with the
mode functions
χin
n(η0) =1
2√π eiπν/2√−η0H(1)
ν(−|kn|η0). (4.14)
These mode functions reduce to the standard plane waves, exp( −i|kn|η0)(2|kn|)−1/2, also
in the limit of large |n|with fixed η0, and the “in” vacuum defined by these modes is in
this sense an adiabatic vacuum at all times [5]. Were χ0not periodic, the “in” vacuum
defined by the corresponding modes, with knreplaced by a continuous momentum,
would coincide with the restriction of the Euclidean vacuum to the exp chart on dS2[4].
Then̸= 0 “in” vacuum contribution to the Wightman function is given by (2.14c)
with (4.14) and L=λ0. Note that this contribution is invariant under redefinitions of
λ0by the coordinate rescalings (3.16).
While we shall not attempt to define distinguished late time modes, we note that at
late times, η0→0−, the leading two terms in the asymptotic behaviour of χin
n(4.14) for
ν̸= 0 are
χin
n(η0)∼−i√π(−η0)1/2

and the expression for ν= 0 is
χin
n(η0)∼−i(−η0)1/2
√π1
2πi+ ln 2 −γ−ln(|kn|)−ln(−η0)
. (4.16)
Theη0-dependence in (4.15) and (4.16) is similar to the ( π−η)-dependence in (4.4)
and (4.5), but the |kn|-dependence in the coefficients is not directly comparable, due to
the differing foliations in the dS2embedding spacetime.
4.3.2 Zero momentum mode
The zero momentum mode is a massive zero mode at η0→ −∞ , and the early time
behaviour does not single out a distinguished mode function. We choose a distinguished
mode function by the late time behaviour, matching the η0→0−asymptotics with
λ0= 2πto the η→π−asymptotics of the Euclidean vacuum n= 0 mode func-
tion (4.2), using (4.4) and (4.5), and including a λ0-dependent scaling of η0to make
the contribution to the Wightman function invariant under redefinitions of λ0by the
14coordinate rescalings (3.16). For ν̸= 0, we obtain

. (4.18)
The zero momentum mode contribution to the Wightman function is given by (2.14b)
with L=λ0, and is invariant under redefinitions of λ0by (3.16).
4.3.3 Euclidean quotient state?
On the exp scale factor FRW spacetime, an attempt to define the Wightman function
of an Euclidean quotient state by adapting the image sum in (4.13) to the periodic
identification in χ0produces an image sum that is not convergent in absolute value, due
to the weak falloff of the hypergeometric function. We shall see in Section 6.4 that a
similar weak convergence appears also in the image sum expression for the stress-energy
tensor. We shall return to this phenomenon in the concluding remarks in Section 8.
5 Comoving detector
In this section we address the response of a comoving UDW detector in the cosh, sinh
and exp scale factor FRW spacetimes.
5.1 Detector and its response function
We consider a spatially pointlike two-level system known as the Unruh-DeWitt dectector
[7,8], on a trajectory x(τ), parametrised by the proper time τ, and coupled linearly to
the scalar field at the detector’s position, ϕ 
x(τ)
.
As reviewed in [13], the detector’s transition probability in first-order perturbation
theory is a multiple of the response function F(ω), given by
F(ω) :=Z
dτ dτ′χ(τ)χ(τ′)e−iω(τ−τ′)G(τ, τ′), (5.1)
where ωis the detector’s energy gap, χis a switching function that specifies how the
15interaction is turned on and off, and G(τ, τ′) is the pull-back of the field’s Wightman
function to the detector’s wordline,
G(τ, τ′) :=⟨Ψ|ˆϕ 
x(τ)ˆϕ 
x(τ′)
|Ψ⟩, (5.2)
with|Ψ⟩being the state in which the field was prepared before the interaction starts.
Positive values of ωgive the probability of excitation and negative values of ωgive the
probability of de-excitation.
When |Ψ⟩is a Hadamard state, G(τ, τ′) is a well-defined distribution [31, 32], and
F(ω) is well defined whenever χis smooth and has compact support. In our present
case of 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions, the coincidence limit singularity of G(τ, τ′) is only
logarithmic, and hence integrable, and F(ω) remains well defined even for less regular χ.
We use this freedom to adopt a χthat has minimal structure of its own, having a constant
value between a sharp switch-on moment and a sharp switch-off moment; we choose
χ(τ) = Θ( τ−τ0)Θ(τ1−τ), (5.3)
where τ0andτ1denote the switch-on and switch-off moments, respectively, and we
assume τ0< τ 1. The response function (5.1) then becomes
F(ω, τ 1, τ0) :=Zτ1
τ0dτZτ1
τ0dτ′e−iω(τ−τ′)G(τ, τ′). (5.4)
We specialise to a comoving detector, at a constant value of xin the FRW coordinates
(t, x) of (2.1). As all the quantum states that we consider are invariant under shifts in the
compactified spatial coordinate x, we may without loss of generality take the trajectory
to be 
t(τ), x(τ)
= (τ,0).
5.2 Cosh scale factor FRW
In the cosh scale factor FRW spacetime, for general λ, a mode sum expression for the
response function is obtained from (2.14), (4.3) and (5.4), with the outcome
F(ω, τ 1, τ0) =1

where we recall that kn= 2πn/λ . We have used (4.3) in preference to (4.2) as this is
likely to be more suitable for numerical evaluation of the large |n|terms. The contribu-
tions from n >0 and n <0 are equal and can be combined to a single sum over nfrom
1 to∞.
16On standard dS2, in which λ= 2π, and on its Mpquotients, in which λ= 2π/p,
p= 2,3, . . ., an alternative is to use the Wightman function as given in (4.6) and (4.8).

−cosh( Hτ−iϵ) cosh( Hτ′+iϵ) sin2(rπ/p) (5.7)

analytic continuation of 2F1from gp,r<1 togp,r>1 across the logarithmic singularity
atgp,r= 1. Note that for the pure dS2term, r= 0, only the first term in (5.7) is present.
5.3 Sinh scale factor FRW
5.3.1 “In” vacuum
In the sinh scale factor FRW spacetime, the contribution to the response function from
n̸= 0 modes in the “in” vacuum is obtained from (2.14c), (4.10) and (5.4), with the

(4.11), (4.12) and (5.4). For ν̸= 0, the outcome is

5.4 Exp scale factor FRW
In the exp scale factor FRW spacetime, the contribution to the response function from

where the last expression is obtained by the substitution τ=τ0+s. The last expression
in (5.14) shows that Fin

variant meaning, only through the combinations λ0eHτ0andτ1−τ0, which do: λ0eHτ0/H
is the spatial circumference at the moment of cosmological time when the detector is
turned on, and τ1−τ0is the proper time that the detector operates.
The contribution from the n= 0 mode in the “in” vacuum is obtained from (2.14b),
(4.17), (4.18) and (5.4). For ν̸= 0, the outcome is

6 Stress-energy tensor
In this section we evaluate the renormalised stress-energy tensor in the states whose
Wightman function comes from that in |0E⟩ondS2by an image sum construction.
6.1 Point-splitting and image sum
Recall that the classical stress-energy tensor for a massive scalar field in 1+1 dimensions
reads [5]

The point-splitting definition of the renormalised expectation value of Tµνin a quantum
state|Ψ⟩is
⟨Ψ|Tµν(x)|Ψ⟩:= lim
x→x′Dµν(x,x′)G(1)
ren(x,x′), (6.2)
where Dµν(x,x′) is a two-point differential operator obtained by promoting the differen-
tial operators acting at a single spacetime point in (6.1) into suitably point-split versions,
andG(1)
ren(x,x′) is obtained from the Hadamard function, G(1)(x,x′) :=G(x,x′)+G(x′,x),
19where G(x,x′) =⟨Ψ|ϕ(x)ϕ(x′)|Ψ⟩, by subtracting purely geometric state-independent
counterterms [5,33].
We shall consider states induced by a quotient construction from |0E⟩ondS2. In
these states, renormalisation is required only in the |0E⟩contribution on dS2, with the
well-known outcome [4]

First, observe that in a locally de Sitter spacetime, where R= 2H2, and using the
field equation, ( □+m2+ 2ξH2)ϕ= 0, the classical expression (6.1) for Tµνreduces to

and, again for the image terms, we need not specify at which point the metric tensors

Second, recall from Sections 4.1 and 4.2 that we now consider the cosh scale factor
FRW spacetimes with λ= 2π/pwith p= 2,3, ..., denoted by Mp, and on them the
induced vacuum |0p⟩, and the sinh scale factor FRW spacetimes with arbitrary λ1, and
on them the Euclidean quotient state. In these states, we have

We have dropped the iϵfromZrbecause for these image terms Zr(x,x′)<1 whenever
xand x′are sufficiently close, which is the case on taking the coincidence limit in (6.2).
For each of these quotients, we hence have
⟨Tµν⟩=⟨0E|Tµν|0E⟩+ ∆⟨Tµν⟩, (6.10)

∆⟨Tµν⟩= lim

The sums in (6.14) are exponentially convergent, due to the falloff of Fat large negative
argument. Note that the overall numerical factors1
2in (6.14) have come from combining
ther <0 image terms with the r >0 image terms, whereas in (6.12) each summand
comes from exactly one image term and the overall numerical factor is1

6.4 Exp scale factor FRW spacetime
In the exp scale factor FRW spacetime, an attempt to induce a state from the Euclidean
vacuum on dS2by an image sum gives for the Wightman function a sum that is not
convergent in absolute value, as we noted in Section 4.3.3. If we set issues of convergence

7 Numerical results
In this section we give selected numerical results for the detector’s response in cosh and
exp scale factor FRW spacetimes. The associated plots are collected in the Appendix.
7.1 Cosh scale factor FRW
Figure 1 shows plots of the detector’s response in the cosh scale factor FRW spacetime
as a function of the energy gap, for the Euclidean vacuum on dS2, and for the induced
vacuum on the Z3quotient M3, for selected values of the parameters as shown. The
plots were evaluated numerically from (5.5).
The high degree of symmetry between excitations and de-excitations indicates that
the response in this parameter range is dominated by the switch-on and switch-off
effects, being significantly different from the long time limit in which the response in the
Euclidean vacuum satisfies the detailed balance condition in the de Sitter temperature
H/(2π) [34].
Theν-dependence in the graphs shows that the overall magnitude of the response
decreases as the effective mass squared m2+ 2ξH2increases, as one would expect. The
peak structure in the graphs comes mainly from the spatially constant mode. Similar
features were found in [13] for a detector in the spatially compact Milne spacetime.
237.2 Exp scale factor FRW
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show plots of the detector’s response in the exp scale factor FRW
spacetime as a function for the energy gap, for the “in” vacuum, including only the spa-
tially nonconstant modes, setting ν= 0, and using two different values of the duration,
for selected values of the circumference parameter λ0. The plots show that reducing the
value of the circumference parameter shifts the de-excitation peaks towards higher (that
is, more negative) de-excitation gaps, and this shift is stronger when the interaction du-
ration is shorter. An alternative way to say this, given that the circumference parameter
does not have an invariant magnitude, is that a detector operating at earlier times has
de-excitation peaks at higher (that is, more negative) values of the de-excitation gaps,
and this effect is stronger when the interaction duration is shorter. Figures 2(c) and
2(d) show a similar shift of the de-excitation peaks for selected positive values of ν.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show plots of the contribution to the detector’s response from
the spatially constant mode only, for fixed circumference parameter but varying ν, in
the “in” state. The response shows peaks at both excitations and de-excitations, non-
symmetrically for low effective mass squared but more symmetrically for high effective
mass squared. This indicates that our choice for the spatially constant mode “in” state
is not close to a no-particle as seen by a local detector. We have also verified that this
structure seems not to depend strongly on the size parameter.
Figures 3(c) and 3(d) show plots of the total response, combining the contributions
from the spatially constant and nonconstant modes, for selected values of the parameters.
The spatially constant mode contribution dominates, with minor modulations from the
spatially nonconstant modes. This is further indication that our choice for the spatially
constant mode “in” state contains significant structure.
8 Conclusions
We have addressed the choice of a quantum state of a real massive scalar field in locally
de Sitter (1+1)-dimensional FRW cosmologies with compact spatial sections, with both
hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic sine and exponential dependence of the scale factor on the
cosmological time. We employed adiabatic criteria at early times, adiabatic criteria at
large momenta, and induction from the Euclidean vacuum on standard global de Sitter,
each of these where applicable. In particular, we found that the early time adiabatic
criterion fails for the spatially constant field mode with the sinh and exp scale factors,
due to the phenomenon known as a massive zero mode, and we discussed a possible
alternative criterion for this mode using the late time dependence.
We found the response function of a cosmologically comoving UDW detector, showing
that local quantum observations do establish that the detector is not in the standard
Euclidean vacuum in standard de Sitter space, and we presented selected numerical
results. For states induced from the Euclidean vacuum by a quotient construction, we
also evaluated the field’s stress-energy tensor in terms of image sums, amenable to future
24analyses by both analytic asymptotic methods and by numerical methods.
Inducing a state on the FRW spacetime from the Euclidean vacuum on standard
de Sitter spacetime was trivially successful for the cosh scale factor spacetimes that are
finiteZpquotients of de Sitter, with p= 2,3, . . ., and less trivially for the sinh scale
factor spacetimes, where the quotienting group is Zand operates on only a subset of
de Sitter; in the latter case, the infinite image sums for the Wightman function and for
the stress-energy were manifestly convergent. A similar induction attempt for the exp
scale factor spacetimes, where the quotienting group is Zand operates on a different
subset of de Sitter, however produced for the Wightman function and for the stress-
energy tensor image sums that are not convergent in absolute value. Is this lack of
convergence due to some minor technical ambiguity that can be sidestepped by, say,
considering derivatives of the field rather than the field itself [35–40], or perhaps a
technical artefact that can be cured by an appropriate resummation [41], or might it
signify some deeper pathology in the sought-for state?
Our choice to work in 1 + 1 dimensions brought in two simplifications. First, a geo-
metric simplification was that as the spatial sections are one-dimensional, they have no
intrinsic curvature, and the compact spatial sections have topology S1for each of the
three expansion laws; further, the cosh and sinh scale factor spacetimes are uniquely clas-
sified by a spatial circumference parameter that takes arbitrary positive values, whereas
the spatial circumference in the exp scale factor spacetime is not associated with an
invariant magnitude. Second, a simplification in the detector’s response was that we
could choose the coupling strength to be constant over the duration of the interaction,
with a sudden switch-on and switch-off, without encountering infinities in the detector’s
transition probabilities, in our first-order perturbation theory treatment.
A generalisation to spacetime dimension d+ 1 with d≥2, and in particular to our
home spacetime dimension d= 3, would need to address a more complicated structure
with both of these features.
First, for d≥2, the spatial sections in the cosh scale factor, sinh scale factor and exp
scale factor foliations of standard de Sitter have now respectively positive, negative and
zero curvature, with the respective spatial geometries of Sdwith the round metric, Rd
with the hyperbolic metric, and Rdwith the Euclidean metric. For the sinh and exp scale
factors, making the spatial sections compact involves again quotients with continuous
parameters, but with a larger choice of spatial topologies; for the cosh scale factor, by
contrast, nonstandard spatially compact sections come from quotients of Sd, and these
quotients have no continuous parameters. Also, while the quotients are by construc-
tion locally spatially homogeneous, not all of them are globally spatially homogeneous.
A comprehensive discussion of the d= 3 case is given in [42].
Second, in the detector’s response, a coupling strength that remains constant over
the interaction duration produces a finite response function for d= 1 and d= 2 but
a divergent response function for d≥3, due to the interplay of the sharp switch-on
and switch-off against the Wightman function’s short distance singularity; see [43] for
a detailed discussion in the Minkowski vacuum. For d≥3, one would hence need to
25consider a less abrupt switching, such as the smooth finite duration switchings considered
in [44,45], or a Cnswitching with some non-negative n[46,47]. Such switchings however
create a new interpretational challenge: how to separate in the detector’s response the
effects due to the switching profile, which is freely adjustable, from the effects due to the
state of the quantum field and the detector’s motion, which is the issue of interest? An
alternative option for d≥3, at least for d≤5 [43], may be to consider not the transition
probability but a transition rate, from which the (divergently) large contribution due to
the abrupt switching drops out in a controlled way [43,48–52].
A generalisation to spacetime dimension d+ 1 with d≥2, and in particular to
d= 3, appears hence feasible, but will face more choices in the spacetimes to be consid-
ered, and more choices in how the detector’s coupling depends on time. We leave this
generalisation a subject for future work.
