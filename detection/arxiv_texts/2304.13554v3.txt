ABSTRACT
Decayless kink oscillations are omnipresent in the solar atmosphere, and they are a viable candidate for coronal heating. Although
there have been extensive studies of decayless oscillations in coronal loops with lengths of a few hundred megameters, the properties
of these oscillations in small-scale ( ∼10 Mm) loops are yet to be explored. In this study, we present the properties of decayless
oscillations in small loops embedded in the quiet corona and coronal holes. We use high-resolution observations from the Extreme
Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter with pixel scales of 210 km and a cadence of 5 s or better. We analysed 42 oscillations
in coronal loops with loop lengths varying between 3 to 23 Mm. The average displacement amplitude is found to be 134 km. The
oscillations period has a range of 28 to 272 s, and the velocity amplitudes range from 2.1 to 16.4 km s−1. The variation in the loop
length with the period does not indicate a significant correlation. The wave mode of these waves is uncertain, and standing waves
are one possibility. Our results for the coronal seismology and energy flux estimates were obtained considering standing modes. The
observed kink speeds are lower than those observed in active region coronal loops. We obtain an average magnetic field value of 2.1
G. We estimated the energy flux with a broad range of 0.6-313 W m−2. Moreover, we note that short-period decayless oscillations
are not prevalent in the quiet Sun and coronal holes. Our study suggests that decayless oscillations in small-scale coronal loops are
unlikely to provide enough energy to heat the quiet Sun and accelerate solar wind in coronal holes.

1. Introduction
The outer layers of the solar atmosphere maintain temperatures
that are greater than those in the solar photosphere. To main-
tain the million-degree temperature of the solar corona, heat-
ing should balance the strong radiative losses. The energy flux
needed to equipoise the energy losses in the quiet-Sun, coronal
holes, and active region is ∼300 W m−2,∼800 W m−2, and 104
W m−2(Withbroe & Noyes 1977). One of the proposed heat-
ing mechanisms of energy transfer in the solar atmosphere is
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves (De Moortel & Brown-
ing 2015; Arregui 2015; Van Doorsselaere et al. 2020; Banerjee
et al. 2021). The transverse displacements of coronal structures
in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images are interpreted as the stand-
ing (Schrijver et al. 1999; Aschwanden et al. 1999) and propa-
gating kink modes of MHD waves (McIntosh et al. 2011; Thur-
good et al. 2014; Weberg et al. 2018; Morton et al. 2019). Since
kink oscillations are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere (Anfino-
gentov et al. 2015), they are candidates for coronal heating (Van
Doorsselaere et al. 2020).
Standing kink oscillations have been categorized into two
distinct regimes. The amplitude of the oscillations, that are ex-
cited by low coronal eruptions such as jets, flares, and coro-nal mass ejections (Nakariakov et al. 1999; White & Verwichte
2012a; Goddard et al. 2016; Sarkar et al. 2016), decays with
time, and they are defined as decaying oscillations. Many active-
region loops have been observed to oscillate with no apparent
decay in amplitude for a few periods. These are known as decay-
less oscillations (Tian et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Anfinogen-
tov et al. 2013; Zhong et al. 2022a). The generation of decayless
oscillations is the subject of ongoing debate, but evidence from
modelling and numerical simulations suggests that these oscilla-
tions can be triggered by quasi-steady flows acting as footpoint
drivers (Nakariakov et al. 2016; Karampelas & Van Doorsselaere
2020). Furthermore, the excitation of these oscillations due to
periodic footpoint drivers has been explored in numerical simu-
lations (Karampelas et al. 2017, 2019; Guo et al. 2019; Shi et al.
2021). Recently, Karampelas & Van Doorsselaere (2021) inves-
tigated the origin of decayless waves through vortex shedding,
while Afanasyev et al. (2020) demonstrated that the observa-
tional signature of decayless oscillations could also be repro-
duced by random footpoint driving. The decayless kink oscil-
lations have been studied for active regions (Anfinogentov et al.
2013; Nisticò et al. 2013; Anfinogentov et al. 2015; Anfinogen-
tov & Nakariakov 2019) and quiescent loops (Duckenfield et al.
Article number, page 1 of 11arXiv:2304.13554v3  [astro-ph.SR]  21 Jan 2024A&A proofs: manuscript no. final_sub_aa
2018) (for a detailed review on kink oscillations, see Nakariakov
et al. 2021).
In the past, several attempts have been made to investigate
whether transverse waves carry su fficient energy to heat di fferent
regions of the solar atmosphere. Several studies have reported
transverse waves in the solar atmosphere and estimated the en-
ergy fluxes by measuring the non-thermal line broadening of the
transition region and coronal emission lines (Hassler et al. 1990;
Banerjee et al. 1998; Hahn & Savin 2013). These authors advo-
cated that the energy fluxes estimated using the non-thermal line
widths are su fficient to heat the solar corona and accelerate solar
wind (Hassler et al. 1990; Banerjee et al. 1998; Hahn & Savin
2013). Doppler velocity fluctuations, which are direct signatures
of transverse waves, observed from the Coronal Multi-Channel
Polarimeter (CoMP; Tomczyk et al. 2008), were found to be
surprisingly small, which indicated that these waves do not pro-
vide su fficient energy to heat the active regions (Tomczyk et al.
2007). It was later found that the large line-of-sight integration
in the CoMP data leads to the underestimation of the wave am-
plitudes that were estimated using Doppler velocity fluctuations
(McIntosh & De Pontieu 2012; Pant et al. 2019).
The observations of the chromosphere and transition region
reveal that kink waves with significant energies to support the
energy losses are omnipresent (De Pontieu et al. 2007; Mor-
ton et al. 2012; Tian et al. 2014). The High Resolution Coro-
nal Imager (Hi-C; Kobayashi et al. 2014) observations of ac-
tive regions indicated that coronal loops contain only little en-
ergy that might support heating (Morton & McLaughlin 2013).
The study of transverse motions in fine-scale structures in active
region moss revealed that kink waves have a higher energy in
the lower layers of the atmosphere than in the corona (Morton
& McLaughlin 2014). These fine-scale structures were not well
resolved by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA; Lemen
et al. 2012) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO; Pes-
nell et al. 2012). MHD waves play an important role in acceler-
ating the solar wind. The large-scale structures in coronal holes
have been explored widely in this context and are seen to exhibit
transverse motions (McIntosh et al. 2011; Thurgood et al. 2014;
Morton et al. 2015, 2019; Weberg et al. 2020). The energy flux of
kink waves in open field structures in coronal holes is computed
to be lower than required for solar wind acceleration (Thurgood
et al. 2014; Morton et al. 2015; Weberg et al. 2018).
Transverse standing waves have been analysed in quiet-Sun
loops as well. Duckenfield et al. (2018) found two periods in de-
cayless oscillation in a large quiet-Sun loop. The quiet Sun and
coronal holes, when seen in X-ray and EUV images, are per-
meated by small-scale loops and coronal bright points (CBPs)
(Golub et al. 1976; Alipour & Safari 2015). Recently, Gao et al.
(2022) analysed decayless kink oscillations in CBPs using AIA.
The study indicated that decayless oscillations are common in
CBPs. The average loop length in their study was ∼23 Mm.
The resolution of AIA does not allow us to detect low-amplitude
transverse oscillations in CBPs, and therefore, the motion mag-
nification technique was applied to enhance the oscillations. Gao
et al. (2022) showed that the energy flux in kink waves in CBPs
is not enough to support the radiative losses.
The high resolution and cadence of the Extreme Ultravio-
let Imager (EUI; Rochus et al. 2020) on board Solar Orbiter
(Müller et al. 2020) has enabled us to probe the dynamics of
small-scale coronal loops, whose signatures in AIA are largely
unclear (Mandal et al. 2021a). Petrova et al. (2023) performed a
case study of two short-period decayless oscillations in the quiet-
Sun region using EUI. The estimated loop lengths were ∼5-10
Mm. Although these oscillations were observed in the quiet Sun,the energy flux of the wave was calculated to be approximately
of a magnitude to balance even active region energy losses. Li &
Long (2022) conducted a statistical analysis of 111 small-scale
active region loops with an average length of ∼15 Mm. The anal-
ysis identified short periods of oscillations ranging from ∼11 to
185 s, with energy fluxes spanning from ∼7 to 9220 W m−2.
The findings of Li & Long (2022) revealed that the median wave
energy flux of these oscillations is considerably lower than the
energy required to heat the active region corona. Additionally,
the authors found a strong correlation between the loop length
and period. Although several studies of transverse oscillations in
the polar region for large-scale structures exist, the kink waves in
small loops rooted in coronal holes and in the quiet Sun have not
been examined extensively. We present a statistical investigation
of the oscillation properties of small coronal loops (of ∼10 Mm)
that are rooted in the coronal holes and quiet regions of the solar
corona using high-resolution observations from EUI. The paper
is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the datasets. Section 3
describes the technique we used. The results and discussions are
presented in Section 4, followed by Section 5, which concludes
the work.
2. Observation and data
The observational datasets we used in this study were obtained
from the High Resolution Imager (HRI EUV) telescope of EUI on
board Solar Orbiter. HRI EUVobserves the corona at 174 Å which
is attributed to Fe IX and Fe X ions, and it captures the coronal
dynamics of plasma at a temperature of ∼1MK. It has a field of
view (FOV) of∼17′×17′with a plate scale of 0.492′′pixel−1.
The level 2 images were obtained from the EUI data re-
lease 5.0 (Mampaey et al. 2022) and 4.0 (Auchère et al. 2021).
The EUI images are a ffected by spacecraft jitter, which we cor-
rected for, and the images were aligned by applying the cross-
correlation technique, as suggested in Mandal et al. (2022).
Figure 1(a)-(c) shows snapshots of the FOV of the Sun ob-
served by HRI EUVfor three di fferent datasets. These snapshots
show many small-scale loops. The green boxes outline the loops
for which oscillations are observed. These images also show
large-scale polar coronal holes and plumes. The datasets are fo-
cused on the quiet Sun and polar regions, with cadences suit-
able for observing short-period kink oscillations. Details of the
datasets we used to identify the loops and build the statistics are
described in Table 1.
We selected several small-scale loops for our study and
found 42 oscillating events in 40 coronal loops. These small-
scale loops appear to be dynamic when investigated using ani-
mation, and many loops appear and disappear during the time
interval of the datasets. The properties of some of these loops
are similar to active region fine-scale loops because they possess
drifting motions (Li & Long 2022).
3. Analysis
Figure 1(d)-(i) shows the small-scale loops outlined by green
boxes corresponding to the upper panels (a), (b), and (c). We
placed slits approximately perpendicular to the loop axis. They
are shown by red lines in each panel. These slits are 5 pixels
wide and were used to generate distance-time ( x−t) maps. The
intensity was averaged over the width of the slits to increase the
signal-to-noise ratio (White & Verwichte 2012b; Nisticò et al.
2013).
Figure 2 shows the x−tmaps of slits S1 to S6 as displayed
in Figure 1(d)-(i). The x−tmaps reveal transverse oscillations.

selected loops for which oscillations are detected. The other loops we studied appear at di fferent times and are not shown here. A magnified view
of the loops in the green boxes for each upper panel is shown in the lower panels. The red lines in panels (d)-(i) depict the position of the artificial
slits we used to generate the x−tmaps. The blue crosses in each panel show the approximate position of the footpoints. Details of the dataset are

These x−tmaps indicate only a part of the slit to show the
oscillations better. The noise in relatively dimly illuminated ar-
eas such as coronal holes and the quiet Sun (Figure 1) is domi-
nated by the sensor read-out noise, in particular, the photon shot
noise. This can be seen as salt-and-pepper noise in the subfields
in Figure 1(d)-(i). In order to optimise the telemetry, the images
were Poisson recoded (Nicula et al. 2005) and compressed by
a JP2000-based compression scheme (WICOM, Rochus et al.
2020) before transmission. During high-cadence HRI EUVobser-
vations, this process is commanded in a high-quality mode such
that artefacts are entirely insignificant. The absence of obvious
horizontal streaks in Figure 2, other than the expected solar fea-
tures under study, also confirms that possibly remaining fixed
noise patterns are negligible after the dark and flat corrections.
We thus approximated the uncertainty in the intensity, I, in DN,
using the following formula (Petrova et al. 2023)
σ2
DN=σ2

photon. (1)
σreadout denotes the readout noise of the HRI EUV detector, es-
timated to be 2 DN. Additionally, the variance in the photonnoise(σ2
photon) is determined by the product of the gain factor,
g (with a value of 6.85 DN /photon, Petrova et al. 2023), and the
intensity, I. Subsequently, the obtained uncertainty values were
employed as errors in intensities to fit a Gaussian function per-
pendicular to the oscillating structure at each time slice. The
Gaussian fitting provides the centre of the oscillating structure
at a particular time. To obtain the parameter of oscillations, we
fit these centres using a sinusoidal function with a linear trend.
ξ(t)=ξ0+ξ1sin(2πt/P+ϕ)+ξ2t. (2)
whereξ1represents the oscillation amplitude, Pis the oscillation
period,ϕis the phase, and ξ0andξ2are constants. We imple-
mented the same techniques for calculating oscillation param-
eters in the 42 oscillations, and 6 are shown in Figure 2. The
best-fit functions are shown as red curves. The error bars shown
in Figure 2 are the standard errors on the centre position of the
loop, obtained after fitting the Gaussian at each time slice. The
amplitude and period obtained after fitting, along with the values
of propagated errors, are indicated in the x−tmaps. We did not

use any automatic method to fit the oscillations as performed in
previous statistical studies (Thurgood et al. 2014; Weberg et al.
2018, 2020). The velocity amplitude of these oscillations was
estimated using the relation V=2πξ1/P. We computed the un-
certainty in velocity amplitude by σ2
V=∂V
∂PσP2+∂V
∂ξ1σξ12.
The loop length was approximated by measuring the distance
between footpoints, assuming a semicircular loop model. Wecalculated the loop length using the relation L=πD/2, where
D is the distance between the loop footpoints. We assumed the
uncertainty in the loop lengths to be 40% (discussed in section
4.5).

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Distribution of the parameters
We estimated the oscillation amplitude, ξ1, the period, P, the
loop length, L, and the velocity amplitude Vfor oscillations cap-
tured using x−tmaps and plotted their distribution. Figure 3
shows the histograms of these parameters. The loop lengths vary
from 3 to 23 Mm with a mean of 9.1 ±4.3 Mm. Previous studies
of decayless oscillations in active-region loops estimated loop
lengths of a few hundred megameters (Anfinogentov et al. 2013,
2015). The study of kink oscillations in CBPs estimated a loop
length in the range of 14-42 Mm (Gao et al. 2022). The loop
length of the few loops we estimated here overlaps with the re-
cent length measurement of active and quiet region loops using
EUI (Petrova et al. 2023; Li & Long 2022). The average loop
length in this analysis is shorter than in previous statistical stud-
ies using AIA because the resolution of EUI is high. The oscil-
lation period lies between 28 to 272s, with a mean of 140 ±64s.
Around 90% of the oscillations have periods greater than 60s,
which is similar to previously estimated periods for coronal
loops (Anfinogentov et al. 2015; Nechaeva et al. 2019; Gao et al.
2022; Zhong et al. 2022b). Ten percent of the oscillation periods
range from 28 to 60s, analogously to the decayless oscillations
detected in small loops (Petrova et al. 2023; Li & Long 2022).
The displacement amplitudes are in the range of 35 to 358 km,
with an average value of 134 ±72 km. The average displacement
amplitude is comparable to the estimated oscillation amplitude
in active region coronal loops (Anfinogentov et al. 2015; Li &
Long 2022). In contrast, it is larger than the estimated amplitudesfor CBPs (Gao et al. 2022). When we consider a similar amount
of energy flux in both scenarios, a greater displacement ampli-
tude is required in smaller loops. The velocity amplitudes are
between 2.1 to 16.4 km s−1, with a mean of 6.6 ±3.1 km s−1. The
velocity amplitudes found in oscillations in CBPs, fine structures
in active region moss, and in large-scale coronal loops are lower
than 10 km s−1(Anfinogentov et al. 2013; Morton & McLaugh-
lin 2013, 2014; Nakariakov et al. 2016; Gao et al. 2022), whereas
∼15% of the oscillations in our study have velocity amplitudes
larger than 10 km s−1.
The mean period, amplitude, and velocity amplitude calcu-
lated in the statistical analysis of propagating kink waves in coro-
nal plumes using AIA are greater than the estimated average of
these quantities in the current work (Thurgood et al. 2014; Mor-
ton et al. 2015; Weberg et al. 2018, 2020). Morton et al. (2019)
examined propagating waves in the fine-scale structure within
the quiet Sun using EUV images. The mean of the period and
velocity amplitudes are larger than those computed in this work.
Furthermore, the velocity amplitudes of propagating waves were
estimated by McIntosh et al. (2011) to be in the range of 20-25
km s−1in quiet regions and coronal holes, which is higher than
the velocity amplitudes measured in this study.
4.2. Correlation between different parameters

ters, described in section 3. The linear Pearson correlation coef-
ficients, along with their standard errors, are also provided in the
plots. The kink speed of an oscillating coronal loop will be pro-

portional to loop length (L) and inverse of the period (P) (Edwin
& Roberts 1983). For a close range of kink speeds, the period is
therefore approximately proportional to the loop length, as ob-
served in the analysis of decayless oscillations of active region
coronal loops with lengths of several hundred megameters (An-
finogentov et al. 2015).
We found no significant correlation between the loop length
and the period of oscillations (Figure 4a). Gao et al. (2022) did
not observe a significant correlation between the loop length and
period in their study and suggested that these oscillations could
be driven at the footpoints and can have periods similar to the
driver, which can also be a possible reason for the poor corre-
lation in our study. Recently, Li & Long (2022) observed short-
period oscillations in coronal loops with a mean length of ∼15
Mm. They found a strong correlation (0.98) between the loop
length and the period.
We found no correlation of the loop length with the displace-
ment and velocity amplitudes. Moreover, our study indicated a
correlation of 0.52 between the displacement amplitude and the
period, as shown in the lower left panel of Figure 4. It is possible
that the correlation between the displacement amplitude and the
period also depends on the sample and is therefore a selection
effect. There may not necessarily be a physical relation between
these two parameters. We find a negative correlation between
the velocity amplitude and the period, as reported in Gao et al.
(2022). The positive correlation between the displacement and
the velocity amplitude and the negative correlation between the
period and the velocity amplitude might arise because they are
directly related.

length in our work, combined with various studies of decay-
less oscillations compiled from Wang et al. (2012); Nisticò

might a ffect the correlation between the loop length and the pe-
riod in our study. However, it is unlikely to cause a significant
shift in the direction of the length axis for the current work, pre-
venting them from being aligned with the L versus P relation
seen for longer loops (see Figure 5).
Figure 6 shows the variation in the loop length and the pe-
riod only for loops found in the quiet Sun and coronal holes that
were studied in Gao et al. (2022), Petrova et al. (2023), and this
work. We assumed an uncertainty of 20% in the loop length esti-
mation for loops studied in Gao et al. (2022). The red data points
were obtained in this study, which indicates that the average loop
length is shorter than in previous statistical studies. The depen-
dence of the oscillation period on the loop length suggests that
the shorter loops will have short periods (Anfinogentov et al.
2015; Goddard et al. 2016; Zhong et al. 2022b; Li & Long 2022).
However, several long-period oscillations are observed in CBPs
with an average loop length of ∼23 Mm (Gao et al. 2022). We
also find many oscillations with longer periods in loops with a
mean length of∼10 Mm (see Figure 5). We find almost no cor-
relation between the loop length and the period obtained in this
work. However, when we consider loops embedded in the quiet
Sun and coronal holes, the cross-correlation coe fficient is im-
proved to be 0.47 ±0.12, which is greater and more significant
than the correlation coe fficient obtained in the present study. It
should be noted that the properties of loops that are embedded
in the quiet Sun and coronal holes can be di fferent because they
form in di fferent magnetic field configurations. However, the dif-
ference between the populations of small loops in the quiet Sun
and coronal holes and its e ffect on the oscillations is not yet clear.
4.3. Phase lag analysis
To understand whether the observed waves are standing or prop-
agating, we positioned multiple slits along each loop in the sam-
ple. We examined the oscillation detected at di fferent slits to cap-
ture any significant phase shift. These loops are characterized by
their small size, short duration, and highly dynamic nature. Due
to the dynamic behaviour of these loops, it is challenging to ac-
curately place the slits and identify a reliable oscillation pattern
at the footpoints. Additionally, the loops are not clearly distin-
guishable from the background at di fferent locations along their
length, making it di fficult to capture oscillations in each part of
the loop. We find that approximately 50% of the loops did not

multi-slit analysis for the two loops shown in panels (b) and (d). S0
and S1 are two slits that were placed at di fferent positions of the loops.

exhibit any noticeable phase shift in the oscillations captured
at different positions of the loop. For the remaining loops, no
distinct oscillation signatures were detected at slits far from the
apex. Nevertheless, no phase shift was obtained close to the apex
of these loops.
Figure 7 shows two loops along with the oscillation signa-
tures at two artificial slits. Figure 7(a) and (c) depicts the oscil-
lations profiles at slit positions S0 (red) and S1 (blue), shown
in Figure 7(b) and (d). These oscillation profiles were obtained
after fitting the x−tmaps of these slits. The x−tmaps used
for phase analysis are unsharp masked to minimise the e ffect
of the variable background and to better detect the oscillations.
S1 (Figure 7(b)) is situated between the loop top and right foot-
point, and the amplitude of the oscillation for S1 is smaller than
the amplitude in S0. Figure 7(a) and (c) shows that no signif-
icant phase shift is present between oscillations at S0 and S1.
The phase lags for these oscillation time-series are 0 ±0.1 s and
0±0.03 s. The uncertainty in the phase lag is calculated by fitting
a Gaussian profile near the maximum phase lag.
We detected transverse oscillations lasting for ∼1.5-5 cycles
at multiple slits at di fferent loop positions. If the loops are not
stable for a longer duration, then oscillations cannot be detected
for several cycles. Thirty-two ( ∼75%) of the detected oscilla-
tions were found to occur with cycles equal to or greater than
two. It is not possible to identify the decay in amplitude for os-
cillations with fewer than two cycles because the decay time of
the decaying oscillations is mostly greater than two cycles. How-
ever, oscillations with cycles equal to or greater than two exhibit
no apparent decay in amplitude.
4.4. Possible wave modes
4.4.1. Standing wave
Unlike the decayless oscillations observed in larger loops, which
demonstrate a linear relation between the loop length and the pe-
riod, which is indicative of a standing wave mode (Anfinogen-
tov et al. 2013, 2015), our study revealed no strong correlation

between the loop length and the period. This suggests that the
nature of these waves may di ffer from the expected standing-
wave behaviour. We focused our attention exclusively on small
loops located in the quiet Sun and coronal holes, as depicted in
Figure 6, which include Gao et al. (2022), Petrova et al. (2023),
and this study. In this subset, we found a correlation coe fficient
of 0.47 between the loop length and the period, which is no-
tably higher than the correlation observed in this study alone.
However, even with this improvement, the correlation is still in-
sufficient to firmly support the interpretation of a standing-wave
behaviour.
In addition, in limited studies of coronal loops, the oscilla-
tions measured at di fferent slit positions showed an in-phase be-
haviour, indicating a standing-mode interpretation (Anfinogen-
tov et al. 2015). Nonetheless, when we consider the phase lag
obtained in this study, they may be indicating a standing-wave
interpretation. However, as the loop length and period showed
no strong correlation, it is not possible to conclude that these
waves are standing.
4.4.2. Propagating wave
The absence of a significant correlation between the loop length
and the period in this study can be considered to mean a
wave mode other than a standing wave. A scenario of a fast-
propagating wave appears to be a possibility. When we assume
that the speeds of fast-propagating waves range from 500-600
km/s and the imaging cadences are 3s and 5s (Table 1), then
the slits need to be at least several megameters apart to detect
the propagation of waves. Because the loop half-length (apex to
footpoint) is of comparable size, it will in most cases, be hard
to identify the propagating waves. Because it takes a consider-
able amount of time for a wave to traverse the entire length of
large stable loops, the measurement of the phase shift between
oscillations at various slit positions is not restricted by the ob-
servational cadence of EUV imagers such as AIA. It is di fficult
to eliminate the possibility of propagating waves completely, but
it is equally challenging to prove their existence in the current
analysis. Consequently, it is not feasible to assert with absolute
certainty whether these waves are standing or propagating.4.5. Coronal seismology and the estimation of the energy
flux
As discussed in the previous section, the wave mode of these
waves is uncertain, and a standing nature is a possibility. The
calculations and estimates provided in this section hold true un-
der the assumption that the oscillations are indeed standing.
For a standing wave, the kink speed (C k) can be calculated
as
Ck=2L
P.
We assumed that the observed oscillations are fundamental
modes. Figure 8(a) shows the distribution of the kink speed. The
kink speed has a range of 27-630 km s−1with an average of
164±123 km s−1. The estimated kink speed for most loops is
lower than that of active region loops (Anfinogentov & Nakari-
akov 2019), but comparable to the kink speeds in CBPs. Us-
ing the internal and external intensities ratio, Gao et al. (2022)
showed that the internal Alfvén speed is correlated to the loop
length with a correlation coe fficient of 0.63. Although we did
not estimate the internal and external intensities, the kink speed
and loop length show a correlation of 0.55 in our study. This sup-
ports the idea that the Alfvén speed increases with height and is
higher for larger loops.
The magnetic field strength, B, can be estimated using the
following relation:
B=Ckp
µ0ρiemr
1+ρe/ρi
2,
whereρiandρeare the internal and external plasma density, and
µ0andemdenote the magnetic permeability in vacuum and the
mean molecular weight. We took ρi=109cm−3and a density
contrast,ρe/ρi=1/3 to calculate the magnetic field (Gao et al.
2022; Petrova et al. 2023; Li & Long 2022). Figure 8(b) shows
the distribution of estimated magnetic field strengths. The av-
erage value of the magnetic field is 2.1 ±1.5 G, with a range of
0.34-8 G. These loops are embedded in the quiet Sun and coro-
nal holes, and most of the loops have a magnetic field strength
lower than 4 G. These estimates of the magnetic fields are lower
than previous estimates using seismology for loop lengths of a

few hundred megameters in an active region (Nisticò et al. 2013).
The potential field extrapolation of photospheric magnetograms
for x-ray bright points shows that several loops with a length
of∼10 Mm have a magnetic field strength greater than 10 G
(Mondal et al. 2023). However, the average value of the mag-
netic field obtained here is similar to quiet-Sun magnetic fields
calculated using magnetoseismology of propagating kink waves
(Yang et al. 2020). West et al. (2011) found a magnetic field
strength of 0.7±0.7 G in the quiet-Sun region by performing
coronal seismology using EIT waves. The underestimation of the
loop length could result in a lower kink speed. The underestima-
tion of the loop length can be about 10% for loops of a few hun-
dred megameters (Mackay et al. 2000; Van Doorsselaere et al.
2007). The analysis of campfire loops with a loop length of ∼3-4
Mm indicated that this underestimation could increase up to ∼
40-50% as it is possible that the part of the loop that is embed-
ded in the chromosphere and photosphere is not observed in 174
Å emission (Berghmans et al. 2021). It must be noted that even
when we add a 50% error in length, the average value of the kink
speed would be 245 km s−1, which remains smaller than those
observed in the coronal heights. Because the kink speed depends
on the internal and external Alfvén speeds, it might be possible
that these structures have quite di fferent density contrasts and /or
magnetic fields compared to large-scale coronal loops.
The energy flux carried by the observed kink waves can be
estimated by the following expression (Van Doorsselaere et al.
2014; Petrova et al. 2023):
Ef=1
2Ck(ρe+ρi)V2.
Using the distribution of C kand V , and considering the values
of the internal plasma density and density contrast (mentioned
in section 4.5), we find a broad range of the energy flux, 0.6-313
W m−2. The mean and median of the energy flux distribution are
19 and 6 W m−2, respectively. The energy flux of 313 W m−2
is obtained for the period of 28 s with a displacement amplitude
of∼73 km. This suggests that short-period oscillations have a
high energy flux in the quiet Sun and coronal holes. Petrova et al.
(2023) analysed two short-period oscillations of ∼14 and 30 s in
the quiet-Sun region. The wave energy fluxes calculated for these
oscillations were 1.9 and 6.5 kW m−2, but in this work, we find
much lower values for the energy flux. This potentially means
that high-energy flux events such as in Petrova et al. (2023) are
not so common in the quiet Sun. We thoroughly examined each
small-scale loop in the datasets and observed these oscillations
on only a few occasions. Within the limited duration of the ob-
servation and the limited field of view of data, we were unable
to find the oscillations to be omnipresent like for the propagating
waves in the CoMP. Gao et al. (2022) presented long-period low-
energy decayless waves in bright points. In our study, we find
both short-period and long-period oscillations. Figure 5 shows
that our study has revealed periods and loop lengths that were ab-
sent in Gao et al. (2022) and Petrova et al. (2023). Although the
maximum energy flux we estimated is su fficient to heat the quiet
corona (Withbroe & Noyes 1977), the mean and median energy
fluxes indicate that decayless waves with high-energy fluxes are
not prevalent in the quiet Sun and coronal holes.
5. Summary and conclusion
We performed the statistical analysis of decayless kink oscilla-
tions in small loops using high-resolution observation from the
HRI EUVtelescopes of EUI. The oscillating loops have lengths ofabout 10 Mm, and they are dynamic in nature. The average loop
length in this study is shorter than in previous statistical stud-
ies of decayless kink oscillations in coronal loops. The analysed
loops have a mean oscillation period and displacement ampli-
tude of 140s and 134 km, respectively. The analysis we carried
out to identify wave modes suggests the potential presence of
standing waves. Nonetheless, the identification of propagating
waves with the datasets used here proves to be a challenging
endeavour. Moreover, the absence of a significant correlation
between the loop length and period precludes their categorisa-
tion as standing-wave modes. The available evidence currently
does not su ffice to draw a definitive conclusion of whether these
waves are standing or propagating. Further insights into the na-
ture of these waves can be gained through numerical simulations
of transverse oscillations in small loops and additional studies
focusing on the same phenomenon. The kink speed, magnetic
field, and energy flux of these waves were calculated consider-
ing that standing waves are one possibility. The estimation of
the kink speed shows a range of ∼27-630 km s−1, which is lower
than the kink speed found in loops of several hundred megame-
ters in active regions. We estimated the magnetic field strength,
which indicated lower values than were obtained in active region
loops. The energy flux estimation provided a range of ∼0.6-313
W m−2. We find that the energy flux of most oscillations is insuf-
ficient to compensate for the radiative losses in the quiet corona
and coronal holes. This indicates that transverse oscillations with
high-energy flux in the quiet Sun and coronal holes may not be
prevalent. In conclusion, if the waves identified in this study are
standing, it implies that the transverse waves in small loops, im-
mersed in coronal holes and quiet corona, cannot provide sig-
nificant energy to balance the radiative losses and accelerate the
solar wind.
