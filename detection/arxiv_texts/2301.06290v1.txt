Abstract
In this paper, we study all possible orders which are less tha n 1 of transcendental
entire solutions of linear diﬀerence equations
Pm(z)∆mf(z)+···+P1(z)∆f(z)+P0(z)f(z) = 0, (+)
wherePj(z) are polynomials for j= 0,...,m. Firstly, we give the condition on ex-
istence of transcendental entire solutions of order less th an 1 of diﬀerence equations
(+). Secondly, we give a list of all possible orders which are less than 1 of transcen-
dental entire solutions of diﬀerence equations (+). Moreove r, the maximum number
of distinct orders which are less than 1 of transcendental en tire solutions of diﬀerence
equations (+) are shown. In addition, for any given rational number 0 < ρ <1, we can
construct a linear diﬀerence equation with polynomial coeﬃc ients which has a tran-
scendental entire solution of order ρ. At least, some examples are illustrated for our
main theorems.

1 Introduction
For a function f, we denote by ∆ f(z) =f(z+1)−f(z) the diﬀerence operator. Let nbe
a nonnegative integer. Deﬁne ∆nf(z) = ∆(∆n−1f(z)) forn≥1, and write ∆0f=f. It is
well known that the linear diﬀerence equation of order m
am(z)∆mf(z)+···+a1(z)∆f(z)+a0(z)f(z) = 0

with entire coeﬃcients aj,j= 0,1,...,m, has a system of mmeromorphic solutions which
are linearly independent over the ﬁeld of periodic functions with perio d one, see [21]. In
particular, if aj,j= 0,1,...,m, are polynomials, i.e.,
Pm(z)∆mf(z)+···+P1(z)∆f(z)+P0(z)f(z) = 0, (1.1)
the order of growth of entire solutions has been investigated in con nection with Newton
polygon, where Pj,j= 0,1,...,m,Pm(z)/ne}ationslash≡0, are polynomials with degree djforj=
0,1,...,m.
TheNewton polygon orNewton-Puiseux diagram has played important roles not only in
the theory of linear diﬀerential equations but also in the theory of lin ear diﬀerence equations,
see e.g., [3], [15, Section 163]. In [12, Theorem 1.1], Ishizaki and Yan agihara adopted the
Newton polygon of (1.1) as the convex hull of N=/uniontextm
j=0Nj, whereNj={(x,y) ;x≥j, y≤
dm−j−(m−j)}for 0≤j≤m, and established a diﬀerence version of Wiman-Valiron theory
for entire functions to obtain Theorem A below under the condition ρ(f)<1/2. Chiang and
Feng extended the condition on the order of growth to entire solut ions of order strictly less
than 1 by establishing an another diﬀerence version of Wiman-Valiron theory in [6]. The
more precise diﬀerence version of Wiman-Valiron estimate was given b y Chiang and Feng
in [7], they conclude that entire solutions to linear diﬀerence equation s with polynomial
coeﬃcients of order strictly less than 1 must have completely regula r growth of rational
order.
Theorem A [7, Theorem 4] Letfbe an entire solution of order of growth ρ(f)<1. Then
the order of growth ρ(f)is a rational number which can be determined from a gradient o f
the corresponding Newton polygon of (1.1). In particular,
logM(r,f) =Lrρ(f)(1+o(1)),
whereL >0andM(r,f) = max |z|=r|f(z)|. Moreover, the solution has completely regular
growth.
ThenaturalquestionarisesfromTheoremAwhetherallpossibleor dersofentiresolutions
(1.1) are determined from a gradient of the corresponding Newton polygon of (1.1). Unfor-
tunately, the general situation is not so simple. For example, there exists an entire solution
f(z) = 1/Γ(z) of thediﬀerence equation z∆f(z)+(z−1)f(z) = 0, which isof order ρ(f) = 1.
In fact, the entire function g(z) =π(z)f(z) is also the solution of z∆f(z)+(z−1)f(z) = 0,
whereπ(z) is any entire periodic function with period one. Note that for any σ∈[1,∞),
there exists a prime periodic entire function π(z) of order ρ(π) =σby [16, Theorem 1].
Hence the growth of order of gis not determined by the equation.
However, the case of the entire solutions of order less than 1 is diﬀe rent. Suppose that
f1,...,f nare entire functions of order less than 1 linearly independent over t he periodic
functionﬁeld ofperiodone, and f=π1f1+···+πnfn, whereπ1,...,π nareperiodic functions
with period one. If ρ(f)<1, thenπ1,...,π nare constants. Therefore, all possible orders
which are less than 1 of entire solutions to a linear diﬀerence equation with polynomial
coeﬃcients could be determined by the equation itself.
It inspires us to consider the entire solutions of order less than 1 of linear diﬀerence
equations with polynomial coeﬃcients. In fact, there exists an ent ire solution of order lessOrders of solutions of linear difference equations 3
than 1 of linear diﬀerence equations with polynomial coeﬃcients unde r some conditions. For
example, there exists an entire solution fof orderρ(f) = 1/2 of the diﬀerence equation
(4z+6)∆2f(z)+3∆f(z)+f(z) = 0.
Wittich [22, pp. 65–68] and Gundersen et al. [9] discussed whether t he possible rational
order given by the Newton polygon for the entire solutions of linear d iﬀerential equations
with polynomial coeﬃcients could be attained or not. Chiang and Feng in [7] ask this
question for diﬀerence equations (1.1). According to the discussio n above, some questions
can be asked. For example
•Which condition implies (1.1) has at least one transcendental entire s olution of order
less than 1?
•Is it possible to give a list of all possible orders which are less than 1 of t ranscendental
entire solutions of a given diﬀerence equation (1.1)?
•Whatisthemaximum number ofdistinct orderswhicharelessthan1of transcendental
entire solutions of a given diﬀerence equation (1.1)?
Inthispaper,weanswerthesethreequestionsbyusingbinomialse ries, whichisadiﬀerent
statement and method from the paper of Gundersen et al. [9]. We a lso response Chiang and
Feng’s concerns in [7]. Moreover, for any given rational number 0 < ρ <1, we show that it
is possible to construct a linear diﬀerence equation with polynomial co eﬃcients which has
at least one transcendental entire solution of order ρ. At least, several examples are given
to illustrate our results.
2 Statement of results
Consider equation (1.1). For convenience, we set dj= degPj. We deﬁne a strictly decreasing
ﬁnite sequence of non-negative integers
s1> s2>···> sp≥0 (2.1)
in the following manner. We choose s1to be the unique integer satisfying
ds1= max
0≤k≤mdkandds1> dkfor all 0≤k < s1. (2.2)
Then given sj,j≥1, we deﬁne sj+1to be the unique integer satisfying
dsj+1−sj+1> dsj−sj (2.3)
and
dsj+1= max
0≤k<sjdkanddsj+1> dkfor all 0≤k < sj+1. (2.4)
For a certain p, the integer spwill exist, but the integer sp+1will not exist, and the sequence
s1,s2,...,s pterminates with sp. Obviously, 1 ≤p≤nand (2.1) holds.4 Ishizaki and Wen
We mention that the integers s1,...,s pin (2.1) could also be expressed in the following
manner:
s1= min/braceleftbigg
j:dj= max
0≤k≤mdk/bracerightbigg
and given sjandj≥1, we deﬁne
sj+1= min/braceleftbigg
i:dsi−si> dsj−sjanddi= max
0≤k<sjdk/bracerightbigg
.
From the deﬁnition of the sequence (2.1), we see that ds1> ds2>···> dsp.Moreover, it
is obvious that
dsp−sp>···> ds2−s2> ds1−s1.
Correspondingly, we deﬁne j= 1,2,...,p−1
ρj= 1+dsj+1−dsj
sj−sj+1(2.5)
whenp≥2. From (2.1) to (2.5), we observe that 0 < ρj<1 for each j, 1≤j≤p−1.
Moreover, we see that
1> ρ1> ρ2>···> ρp>0.
In order to answer our four questions in the Section 1. We state ou r results as follows
Theorem 2.1 Suppose that p= 1. There does not exist any transcendental entire solution
of order less than 1 of diﬀerence equations (1.1)with polynomial coeﬃcients.
Theorem 2.2 Ifp≥2, then there exists at least one transcendental entire solut ion of order
less than 1 of diﬀerence equations (1.1). Moreover, there exist at lease one and at most
(dsj+1−sj+1)−(dsj−sj)linearly independent solutions of order less than 1 of (1.1)with
polynomial coeﬃcients such that ρ(f) =ρjforj= 1,2,...,p−1.
We obtain the following corollaries from Theorem 2.1 and Theorem 2.2.
Corollary 2.3 There exists at least one transcendental entire solution of order less than 1
of diﬀerence equations (1.1)if and only if p≥2.
Corollary 2.4 Ifp≥2, then there exist at most (s1−sp)−(ds1−dsp)transcendental entire
solutions of order less than 1 of diﬀerence equations (1.1).
Corollary 2.5 There does not exist any transcendental entire solution fof orderρ(f) = 0
of diﬀerence equations (1.1).Orders of solutions of linear difference equations 5
3 Binomial series
We recall and study the properties of binomial series, [11], [12]. Deﬁn ez0= 1 and
zn=z(z−1)···(z−n+1) =n!/parenleftbiggz
n/parenrightbigg
, n= 1,2,3,..., (3.1)
which is called a falling factorial . This yields
∆zn= (z+1)n−zn=nzn−1, (3.2)
which corresponds to ( zn)′=nzn−1in the diﬀerential calculus. Consider the formal series
of the form
Y(z) =∞/summationdisplay
n=0anzn, an∈C, n= 0,1,2,.... (3.3)
For a ﬁxed z, if/summationtext∞
n=0|an||zn|converges, we say that Y(z) in (3.3) absolutely converges at
z. We write the limit function of Y(z) asy(z). Let{αn}be a sequence satisfying |αn| →0.
We deﬁne a quantity concerning {αn}as
χ({αn}) = limsup
n→∞nlogn
−log|αn|. (3.4)
In [11] we consider properties of binomial series in the complex domain and discuss a
criterion for convergence of binomial series in connection with the o rder of growth of entire
functions. We state our result as follows.
Theorem B [11, Theorem 1.1] Suppose that χ({an})<1. Then the formal series Y(z)
given by (3.3)converges to y(z)uniformly on every compact subset in C. Moreover, the
order of growth of y(z)coincides with χ({an}).
We deﬁne the diﬀerence power function as
zρ=Γ(z+1)
Γ(z+1−ρ)(3.5)
for anyρ∈C, which yields
∆zρ=Γ(z+2)
Γ(z+2−ρ)−Γ(z+1)
Γ(z+1−ρ)=/parenleftbiggz+1
z+1−ρ−1/parenrightbiggΓ(z+1)
Γ(z+1−ρ)
=ρΓ(z+1)
(z+1−ρ)Γ(z+1−ρ)=ρzρ−1.
Whenρ∈N+, it is the deﬁnition of the falling factorial (3.1). Consider the formal solution
of (1.1) of the form
f(z) =∞/summationdisplay
n=0anzn+ρ, (3.6)6 Ishizaki and Wen
whereρ∈Candan∈Cforn= 0,1,.... We note that
zn+ρ=Γ(z+1)
Γ(z+1−n−ρ)=Γ(z+1)
Γ(z+1−ρ)(z−ρ)n=zρ(z−ρ)n.
Therefore, the series (3.3) converges if and only if the series (3.6) converges by
f(z) =∞/summationdisplay
n=0anzn+ρ=∞/summationdisplay
n=0anzρ(z−ρ)n=zρ∞/summationdisplay
n=0an(z−ρ)n.
The following lemma is about the product of falling factorial and diﬀere nce power func-
tion.
Lemma 3.1 For anym∈Nandρ∈C, we have

zzρ= (z−ρ)zρ+ρzρ= (z−ρ)Γ(z+1)
Γ(z+1−ρ)+ρzρ=zρ+1+ρzρ.

4 Asymptotic behavior of solutions of linear diﬀerence
equations
In this section, we recall the fundamental theorems on the asymp totic behavior of solutions
of linear diﬀerence equations. It is widely accepted among research ers in diﬀerence equations
that the theorem of Poincar´ e [20] makes the beginning of researc h in the qualitative theory
of linear diﬀerence equations, see [8, Section 8.2] or [13, Section 5.3 ]. In 1885 the French
mathematician H. Poincar´ e studied the linear diﬀerence equations o f the form
x(n+k)+p1(n)x(n+k−1)+···+pk(n)x(n) = 0 (4.1)
such that there are real numbers pi, 1≤i≤k,k∈N+, with
lim
n→∞pi(n) =pi,1≤i≤k. (4.2)
An equation of the form (4.1) with the condition (4.2) is called a diﬀeren ce equation of
Poincar´ e type . The characteristic equation associated with (4.1) is
λk+p1λk−1+···+pk= 0. (4.3)
Poincar´ e’s Theorem .Suppose that condition (4.2)holds and the characteristic roots
λ1,λ2,...,λ kof(4.3)have distinct modulus. If x(n)is a solution of (4.1), then either
x(n) = 0for all large nor
lim
n→∞x(n+1)
x(n)=λi (4.4)
for some i,1≤i≤k.
Note that Poincar´ s Theorem does not tell us whether or not each characteristic root λi
can be written in the form (4.4). In 1909 O. Perron in [17] gave an aﬃr mative answer to
this question.
Perron’s First Theorem .Suppose that pk(n)/ne}ationslash= 0for alln∈N+and the assumptions of
Poincar´ e’s Theorem hold. Then a fundamental set of solutio ns{x1(n),x2(n),...,x k(n)}of
(4.1)satisﬁes the property
lim
n→∞xi(n+1)
xi(n)=λi,1≤i≤k.
Later Perron in [18] proved an asymptotic result of a diﬀerent typ e, which is true without
any restriction on the roots of characteristic equation (4.3).
Perron’s Second Theorem Suppose that pk(n)/ne}ationslash= 0for alln∈N+and(4.3)holds. Then
(4.2)has a fundamental set of solutions {x1(n),x2(n),...,x k(n)}of(4.1)with the property
limsup
n→∞n/radicalbig
|xi(n)|=λi,1≤i≤k.8 Ishizaki and Wen
In 2002 Pituk [19] obtained a result, similarly to the situation in Poincar ´ e theorem,
without assumptions on pk(n)/ne}ationslash= 0.
Pituk’s Theorem Suppose the condition (4.2)holds. If x(n)is a solution of (4.1), then
eitherx(n) = 0for all large nor
limsup
n→∞n/radicalbig
|x(n)|=λ
is equal to the modulus of one of the roots of the characterist ic equation (4.3).
The remarkable paper on the asymptotic behaviour of solutions is du e to C.R. Adams
[1]. We obtain the main term of formal series solutions by the results in his paper. We focus
on the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of linear diﬀerence equatio ns
p0(n)x(n+k)+p1(n)x(n+k−1)+···+pk(n)x(n) = 0 (4.5)
whose coeﬃcient functions are expressible in the form
pi(n) =ai0+ai1n−1+ai2n−2+···
for all large nand whose characteristic equation is
a00λk+a10λk−1+···+ak−1,0λ+ak0= 0. (4.6)
It is known that there are klinearly independent solutions of (4.5). Let us just summarize
Adams’ results on calculating main terms of formal solutions as follow s, which is enough for
us to consider the behaviour of binomial series in Section 5.
Case 1 ( a00/ne}ationslash= 0andak0/ne}ationslash= 0). Corresponding to a root λof (4.6) with multiplicity
m≥1, there are mlinearly independent formal series of the following type
x(n)∼λnnreL(n), (4.7)
whereris a constant, L(n) is a polynomial of n1/jwith coeﬃcients being diﬀerent in the
diﬀerent series of degree at most j−1 for some j≤m. Obviously, there are klinearly
independent formal solutions of the form (4.7) corresponding to t he characteristic equations
(4.6).
Case 2 (one or both a00,ak0= 0). Let us denote by ai,jithe ﬁrst nonzero coeﬃcients
inpi(n) (i= 0,1,...,k), and choosing i−andj−axes, plot the points ( i,ji) as in Figure 1.
Construct broken lines L, convex upward, such that both ends of each segment of the line
are points of the set ( i,ji) and such that all points of the set lie upon or beneath the line, see
e.g., [1, P. 511]. Let the slope of any such segment Lbeµ, and the number of points ( i,ji)
that lie on or beneath that segment Lisν. Then the degree of the characteristic equation
associated withthat segment Lisν−1. There are ν−1 linearly independent formal solutions
associated with the segment Lof the following type
x(n)∼n−µneµnλneL(n)nr, (4.8)Orders of solutions of linear difference equations 9
whereλis a root of the characteristic equation associated with that segme ntL,ris a
constant, and L(n) is a polynomial of n1/jwith coeﬃcients being diﬀerent in the diﬀerent
series of degree at most j−1 for some j≤ν−1. Evidently the sum of the degrees of these
several characteristic equations is k. Obviously, there are klinearly independent formal
solutions of the form (4.8) of diﬀerence equations (4.5).

We note here that asymptotic behaviour of solutions of diﬀerence e quations (4.1) of the
form(4.7) or (4.8) is enough for us inthis paper, but it is not enoughf or asymptotic analysis.
In fact, there are lots of paper to show how to calculate coeﬃcient s of formal series solutions.
We refer to [1], [2, 3], [4] for more details, and [23] for second order c ase.

whereAj,i∈Cfor 0≤i≤dj, andAj,dj/ne}ationslash= 0. Therefore, it follows from Lemma 3.1 that

In the following, we proceed to seek for the linearly independent asy mptotic solutions of
(5.4). The proofs of theorems heavily depend on asymptotic behav iour of solutions of linear
diﬀerence equations.
5.1 Proof of Theorem 2.1
Suppose that p= 1. Since ds1≥dkfork≥s1andds1> dkfor 0≤k < s1, we have
degQ(n,k)≤ds1−kfor−m≤k < ds1−s1 (5.5)
and degQ(n,ds1−s1) =s1, and
Q(n,k) = 0 for ds1−s1< k≤d.12 Ishizaki and Wen
We rewrite (5.4) as
an+mQ(n,−m)+an+m−1Q(n,−m+1)+···+an−(ds1−s1)Q(n,ds1−s1) = 0.(5.6)
We denote by an index ξsatisfying −m≤ξ≤dsuch that deg Q(n,ξ)>degQ(n,k) for

dividedQ(n,ξ) in both side of (5.6), let us write (5.6) as
an+mA0(n)+an+m−1A1(n)+···+an−(ds1−s1)Am+ds1−s1(n) = 0, (5.7)
where
Ai(n) =Ai,0+Ai,1n−1+Ai,2n−2+···
fori= 0,1,...,m+ds1−s1. Let us denote by Ai,jithe ﬁrst nonzero coeﬃcient in Aifor
i= 0,1,...,m+ds1−s1. Choosing iandjaxes, we plot the points ( i,ji). Construct a
segment L, convex, such that both ends of the line are points of the set ( i,ji) and such that
all points of the set lie upon or beneath the line. Obviously, the numbe r of these segments
are not greater than m+ds1−s1. The segments are denoted by L1,L2,..., respectively, and
slopes of such segments are denoted by µ1,µ2,..., which are rational numbers. The degrees
of characteristic equations corresponding to these segments ar e denoted by ν1,ν2,.... In
addition, the point (0 ,j0) is the beginning point and the point ( m+ds1−s1,jm+ds1−s1) is
the ending point from left to right, see Figure 1.
From the construction of the convex lines, we see that µtis increasing for t, and
ji= degQ(n,ξ)−degQ(n,i−m)
fori= 0,1,...,m+ds1−s1. Let us suppose that the last segment is denoted by Lχwhich
connects the points ( t,jt) and (m+ds1−s1,jm+ds1−s1). Therefore, it follows from (5.5) that
µχ=degQ(n,t−m)−degQ(n,ds1−s1)
(m+ds1−s1)−t
≤(ds1−(t−m))−s1
(m+ds1−s1)−t

It implies that all the slopes of segments are no greater than 1. By [ 1], for any j= 1,2,...,χ,
we know there are νjlinearly independent formal solution of (5.7) corresponding to the
segment Ljof the form

5.2 Proof of Theorem 2.2
In order to prove Theorems 2.2, we proceed to seek for all linearly in dependent asymptotic
solutions of (5.4) by the method in [1]. Since the relation (2.2) to (2.4) h old, we have
degQ(n,k)≤ds1−kfor−m≤k < ds1−s1;
degQ(n,k) =sj fork=dsj−sj;
degQ(n,k)≤dsj+1−kfordsj−sj< k < d sj+1−sj+1;
Q(n,k) = 0 for dsp−sp< k≤d.(5.8)
We rewrite (5.4) as
an+mQ(n,−m)+an+m−1Q(n,−m+1)+···+an−(dsp−sp)Q(n,dsp−sp) = 0.(5.9)
It is well known that there are m+dsp−splinearly independent solutions of (5.9). Let us
set
an+m=x(n)
[(n+m)!]µ,
whereµ∈R. Thenx(n) satisﬁes the recurrence relation
x(n)T(n,µ,0)+x(n−1)T(n,µ,1)+···+x(n−(dsp−sp))T(n,µ,d sp−sp) = 0,(5.10)
where
T(n,µ,i) =Q(n,i−m)[(n+m)i]µ
fori= 0,1,...,m+dsp−sp. The highest power on nofT(n,µ,i) is denoted by deg T(n,µ,i).
Obviously,
degT(n,µ,i) = degQ(n,i−m)+iµ
fori= 0,1,...,m+dsp−sp. Since we assume that p≥2, for given j= 1,2,...,p−1 and
for anyµ >1,we deduce from (5.8) that
degT(n,µ,m+dsj+1−sj+1)>degT(n,i) form+dsj−sj< i < m +dsj+1−sj+1;
degT(n,µ,m+ds1−s1)>degT(n,i) for 0 ≤i < m+ds1−s1.

Now let us choose µj= 1/ρjforj= 1,2,...,p−1, we have
degT(n,µj,m+dsj−sj) = degT(n,µj,m+dsj+1−sj+1) (5.12)
for anyj= 1,2,...,p−1. Moreover, if p≥3, it yields that for any given j= 1,2,...,p−1

6 Entire solution of rational order between 0 and 1
In this section, we will construct a linear diﬀerence equation (1.1) wit h polynomial coeﬃ-
cients, which has an entire solution of rational order between 0 and 1.
Theorem 6.1 For any positive rational number λ <1, there exists a linear diﬀerence equa-
tion(1.1)with polynomial coeﬃcients such that fis an entire solution of (1.1)of order
ρ(f) =λ.
Proof.For any given positive rational number λ <1, we write
λ=q

wherepandqare relatively prime positive integer such that q < p. We set a linear diﬀerence
equation

whereAjare constants for j= 0,...,p. We consider a formal solution f(z) =/summationtext∞

given by (3.6). Since

for any positive integer kandm, we write (6.1) as
Ap∞/summationdisplay
n=0annpzn+···+A1∞/summationdisplay
n=0annzn−A0∞/summationdisplay
n=qan−qzn= 0. (6.2)
Hence, it gives us that a1=···=aq−1= 0 and
f(n)an=an−q
forn≥q, wheref(n) = (Apnp+···+A1n)/A0. Hence we see that aqt−1=···=aqt−q+1= 0
fort∈Nby setting n=qt, and get
f(qt)aqt=aq(t−1). (6.3)
Now let us set f(qt) = (pt)p, namely, we choose A0,...,A psuch that
Apnp+···+A1n
A0=/parenleftBign
λ/parenrightBigp
. (6.4)
It is easy to see that A0/Ap=λpfrom (6.4). It follows from (6.3) that
aqt=aq(t−1)
(pt)p=aq(t−2)
(pt)p(p(t−1))p=···=a0
(pt)!.
It implies that fis of the form
f(z) =∞/summationdisplay
t=0a0
(pt)!zqt.
BymeansofTheorem B, theformalsolutionconverges toanentire functionoforder λ=q/p,
since
χ({aqt}) = limsup
t→∞qtlog(qt)
−log(pt)!=q
p=λ <1. (6.5)
We have thus proved that (6.1) possesses an entire solution of ord erλ. We set z+qin
place ofzin (6.1), and use a formula
∆mf(z+k) =m/summationdisplay
j=0m!
j!(m−j)!(−1)jk+m−j/summationdisplay
i=0(k+m−j)!

7 Examples
In this section we give several examples which illustrate our theorem s.
Example 1 In [12, Remark 6.3] Ishizaki and Yanagihara shows that there exist s a tran-
scendental entire solution fof orderρ(f) = 1/3 of the diﬀerence equation
(6z2+19z+15)∆3f(z)+(z+3)∆2f(z)−∆f(z)−f(z) = 0. (7.1)
From Theorems 2.1 to 2.2, we know that p= 2,s1= 3 and s2= 0. Hence, there exists
at least one transcendental entire solution of order ρ(f)<1 of (7.1). In addition, the only
possibility of order is ρ1= 1/3, and the number of entire solution of order ρ(f) = 1/3 is one.
Moreover, suppose that (7.1) has a formal solution
f(z) =∞/summationdisplay
n=0anzn+ρ.
We substitute it into (7.1), and by Lemma 3.1 we obtain that

n=−1(n+1+ρ)an+1zn+ρ−∞/summationdisplay
n=0(n+ρ)anzn+ρ= 0.
Denoting that
Q1(n,ρ) = 6(n+ρ)5+25(n+ρ)4+15(n+ρ)3;
Q2(n,ρ) = 12(n+ρ)4+26(n+ρ)3+3(n+ρ)2;
Q3(n,ρ) = 6(n+ρ)3+(n+ρ)2−(n+ρ),
we have
−an+Q3(n+1,ρ)an+1+Q2(n+2,ρ)an+2+Q1(n+3,ρ)an+3= 0 for n≥ −3,(7.2)
whereaj= 0 when j <0. Therefore, it follows that ρ1= 0,ρ2= 1,ρ3= 2,ρ4= 4/3 and
ρ5= 3/2 ifn=−3 in (7.2). We denote
An(ρ) =(n+ρ+2)(n+ρ+1)(2n+2ρ+1)(3n+3ρ+2)an+2
+(n+ρ+1)(n+ρ)(6n+6ρ−5)an+1−an
forn≥0, then from (7.2)
(n+ρ+1)An+1(ρ)+An(ρ) = 0.Orders of solutions of linear difference equations 17
If we set A0(ρ) = 0, then An= 0 for any n≥0. Therefore, it yields
(n+ρ+2)(n+ρ+1)(2n+2ρ+1)(3n+3ρ+2)an+2+(n+ρ+1)(n+ρ)(6n+6ρ−5)an+1−an= 0.
Now let us denote
Bn(ρ) = (n+ρ+1)(2n+2ρ−1)(3n+3ρ−1)an+1−an,
thus,
(n+ρ+1)Bn+1(ρ)+Bn(ρ) = 0.
Let us set Bn(ρ) = 0, it gives us that Bn(ρ) = 0 for any n≥0. Hence, it shows us that
(n+ρ+1)(2n+2ρ−1)(3n+3ρ−1)an+1−an= 0
forn≥0. By the summation formula, see e.g., [13, P. 48], we obtain that
an=Γ(ρ−1/2)Γ(ρ−1/3)a0
6nΓ(n+ρ+1)Γ(n+ρ−1/2)Γ(n+ρ−1/3).
The condition A0(ρ) =B0(ρ) = 0 and n=−2 in (7.2) gives us ρ= 0,ρ= 3/2 andρ= 4/3.
In this way, we ﬁnd three linear independent solutions as follows:
f1(z) =∞/summationdisplay
n=01
6nΓ(n+1)Γ(n−1/2)Γ(n−1/3)zn

n=01
6nΓ(n+1)Γ(n−1/2)Γ(n−1/3)(z−3/2)n

f3(z) =Γ(z+1)
Γ(z−1/3)∞/summationdisplay
n=01
6nΓ(n+1)Γ(n−1/2)Γ(n−1/3)(z−4/3)n
is meromorphic of order 1 with inﬁnitely many poles. We claim that f1,f2andf3are linear
independent over period ﬁeld with period one.
Example 2 By means of the method in the proof of Theorem 6.1, we construct a diﬀerence
equation that possesses an entire solution of order 3 /4. We now consider a forth order linear
diﬀerence equation with polynomial coeﬃcient

Note that (6.6) is obtained by (7.4) and (7.5). Equation (7.3) is derive d from the following
diﬀerence equation
256z(z−1)(z−2)∆4y(z−3)+384z(z−1)∆3y(z−2)
−80z∆2y(z−1)+40∆ y(z)−81z(z−1)y(z−2) = 0.(7.6)
In fact, setting z+3 in place of zin (7.6), we have
(256z3+1920z2+4656z+3640)y(z+4)−(1024z3+7296z2+16864z+12616) y(z+3)

+(256z3+1536z2+2816z+1536)y(z) = 0.(7.7)
Applying (7.4) to (7.7), we obtain (7.3). Consider a solution y(z) =/summationtext∞

Observe the corresponding Newton polygon to (7.3) with m= 4,d4= 3,d3= 2,d2= 1,
d1= 2 and d0= 2, which gives p= 2,s1= 4 and s2= 0. We thus conﬁrmed ρ= 3/4 by

where
Q(n,−4) = 8(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(n+4)(2n+5)(4n+7)(4n+13)
Q(n,−3) = 24(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)(2n+3)(4n+3)(4n+9)

Q(n,−1) = (n+1)(256n3−465n2−357n−446)
Q(n,0) =−243(n+1)(n+2), Q(n,1) =−243(n+1), Q(n,2) =−81,
which gives the corresponding recurrent relation to (5.10). We obt ain the points ( i,ji),
i= 0,1,...,6 from the ﬁrst nonzero coeﬃcients described in Section 4 as (0 ,0), (1,1), (2,2),
(3,3), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7). The slope of the segment from (3 ,3) to (6,7) of the convex broken
line implies the order 3 /4.
Example 3 We give a diﬀerence equation possessing transcendental entire so lutionsd(z)
andh(z) of order less than 1 whose orders are diﬀerent, which is a modiﬁcat ion of [12,
Example 6.1]. First we adopt the (7.1) in Example 1, which gives a transc endental entire

This implies that χ({αn}) = 1/3 and Theorem B concludes that ρ(f) = 1/3, see Example 1,

Setg(z) =zf(z). Thenρ(g) = 1/3, and we see by direct computations that g(z) satisﬁes

h(z) above is a transcendental entire solution of L8[y(z)] = 0 of order 1 /5. Another entire
solution is given by L5[d(z)] =g(z) whereg(z) =zf(z) is the solution of L3[g(z)] = 0 which
was obtained above. Write d(z) =/summationtext∞
n=0δnzn. Byzf(z) =/summationtext∞
n=1(nαn+αn−1)znand (7.13),
we have
n(2n−1)(2n−3)(3n−1)(3n−4)δn−δn−1=αn−1+nαn. (7.15)
We write δn=δ(1)
n+δ(2)
n, and obtain {δn}satisfying
n(2n−1)(2n−3)(3n−1)(3n−4)δ(1)
n−δ(1)
n−1=αn−1, (7.16)
n(2n−1)(2n−3)(3n−1)(3n−4)δ(2)
n−δ(2)
n−1=nαn, (7.17)
which gives a candidate of entire solution of L5[d(z)] =g(z). Let us denote Dn=δ(1)
n/αn.
From (7.10) and (7.16),
(2n−1)(3n−1)Dn= 1+Dn−1.Orders of solutions of linear difference equations 21
Further, we deﬁne (2 n−1)(3n−1)Dn=D′
n. Then we have
D′
n= 1+1
(2n−3)(3n−4)D′
n−1
= 1+1
(2n−3)(3n−4)+1
(2n−3)(3n−4)(2n−5)(3n−7)D′
n−2=···,
whichimpliesthat D′
n=O(1)and1 /D′
n=O(1)asn→ ∞. Thisyieldsthat δ(1)
n=O(n−2)αn
andαn=O(n2)δ(1)
n. Similarly, we estimate δ(2)
n. From (7.10) and (7.17),
(2n−1)(3n−1)En=1
(2n−3)(3n−4)+En−1.
Further, we deﬁne (2 n−1)(3n−1)En=E′
nand putEn=δ(2)
n/αn. Then we have
E′
n=1
(2n−3)(3n−4)+E′
n−1
=1
(2n−3)(3n−4)+1
(2n−3)(3n−4)(2n−5)(3n−7)E′
n−2=···,
which implies that E′
n=O(1) asn→ ∞, and hence δ(2)
n=O(n−2)αn. Since they are
non-negative, we see that χ({δn}) is of the same order to g(z), which is of the same order
tof(z). Hence we have constructed d(z) of a solution of L5[d(z)] =g(z) that has the same
order to f(z).
