LI CAI AND YANGYU FAN
Abstract. In this short notes, we consider multiplicities of represen tations in general algebraic families,
especially the upper semi-continuity of homological multi plicities and the locally constancy of Euler-
Poincare numbers. This generalizes the main result of Aizen bud-Sayag for unramiﬁed twisting families.

1.Introduction
LetGbe a reductive group over a p-adic ﬁeld FandH⊂Gbe a closed spherical reductive sub-
group, i.e. Hadmits an open orbits the ﬂag variety of G. LetRep(G,C)be the category of complex
smoothG(F)-representations. In the relative Langlands program (see [20] etc), it is central to study the
multiplicity m(σ) := dimHom H(F)(σ,C)for smooth admissible σ∈Rep(G,C).
As suggested in [ 17], to study m(σ), it is more convenient to consider the homological multipli cities
mi(σ) := dimExti
H(F)(σ,C)and the Euler-Poincare number EP(σ) :=/summationtext
i≥0(−1)imi(σ)simultaneously.
Usually, the Euler Poincare number EP(σ)is easier to control and in many circumstances, one may
expect to deduce results on m(σ)from those of EP(σ). For example, it is conjectured in [ 17] (see also
[22, Conjectures 6.4,6.5]) that when the pair (G,H)isstrongly tempered , i.e. the matrix coeﬃcients
of tempered G(F)-representations are absolutely integrable on H(F), thenm(σ) = EP(σ)for any ir-
reducible tempered σ∈Rep(G,C). Actually the stronger result mi(σ) = 0 fori >0is known for the
(GLn+1×GLn,GLn)-case (see [ 8]), Bessel model for classical groups (see [ 9]), the triple product case
(see [5]) and when H(F)is compact (see [ 1, Thm 2.14] etc) or σis supercuspidal (see [ 22, Remark 6.6]).
In this paper, we shall consider variations of mi(σ)andEP(σ)in families. Throughout this paper, we
assume the following working hypothesis:
the multiplicity m(σ)isﬁnite for all irreducible σ∈Rep(G,C).
This implies that mi(σ)andEP(σ)are all well-deﬁned and ﬁnite for arbitrary ﬁnite length σ∈Rep(G,C)
(see the discussion at the beginning of Section 3). Note that this hypothesis is already known in many
cases [ 20, Theorem 5.1.5] and conjectured to hold for all spherical pa irs.
To explain the ﬂavor of the main result, let us start with the unramiﬁed twisting family .
Unramiﬁed twisting family. LetP⊂Gbe a parabolic subgroup with Levi factor Mand take
σ∈Rep(M,C)of ﬁnite length. Attached to the data (P,M,σ), one has the unramﬁed twisting family/braceleftBig

1For arithmetic applications such as p-adic special value formulae on eigenvarieties (see [ 10] etc), we
are motivated to consider the following setting (following [12,11]): Fix a subﬁeld E⊂Cand letR
be a ﬁnitely generated reduced E-algebra. Let πbe a ﬁnitely generated smooth admissible torsion-free
R[G(F)]-module, namely a ﬁnitely generated R[G(F)]-module πsuch that
•anyv∈πis ﬁxed by an open compact subgroup of G(F);
•the submodule πK⊂πofK-ﬁxed elements is ﬁnitely generated over Rfor any compact open
subgroup K⊂G(F);
•πis torsion-free as a R-module.
For any point x∈Spec(R), letk(x)be the residue ﬁeld and denote the category of smooth G(F)-
representations over k(x)byRep(G,k(x)). Forπ|x:=π⊗Rk(x)∈Rep(G,k(x)), set
mi(π|x) := dim k(x)Exti
H(F)(π|x,k(x)),EP(π|x) :=/summationdisplay
i≥0(−1)imi(π|x)
where the Ext-groups are computed in Rep(G,k(x)). Note that by Proposition 3.2below, all the numbers
mi(π|x)andEP(π|x)are well-deﬁned and ﬁnite under our running hypothesis.
Supported by the results for unramiﬁed twisting families, w e propose the following conjecture:
Conjecture 1.1. With respect to the Zariski topology on Spec(R),mi(π|x)is upper semi-continuous
for each i∈NandEP(π|x)is locally constant.
Remark 1.2.The following example in [ 5] shows that the upper-semicontinuity is optimal to expect i n
general. Let K/F be a quadratic ﬁeld extension and θ∈Gal(K/F)be the non-trivial element. The
spherical pair (G:=Gm\ResK/FGL2,H:=Gm\GL2)is not strongly tempered. Consider the G(F)-
representation IG
P(χ)wherePis the parabolic subgroup consisting of upper triangular ma trices and
χ= (χ1,χ2)is a character of the Levi quotient M(F)∼=(K×)2/F×. Thenmi(IG
Pχ) = 0,i≥2and
•m(IG
Pχ)≤1with the equality holds iﬀ χ1|F×=χ2|F×= 1orµ(χ) :=χ1·(χ2◦θ) = 1;
•m1(IG
Pχ)≤1with the equality holds iﬀ χ1|F×=χ2|F×= 1andµ(χ)/\e}atio\slash= 1;
•EP(IG
Pχ)≤1with the equality holds iﬀ µ(χ) = 1.
In particular, consider the family IG
P(σχλ)whereσ= (ξ,1)withξ:F×\K×→C×is a non-trivial
character and χλ= (|·|λ,|·|−λ),λ∈C. Then as functions of λ,m0(IG
P(σχλ))andm1(IG
P(σχλ))both
jump at λ= 0whileEP(IG
P(σχλ))is constant.
To state the main result, we need to introduce more notations . As the local analogue of classical points
in eigen-varieties, we ﬁx a Zariski dense subset Σ⊂Spec(R)of closed points. We say the ﬁber rank of
πis locally constant on Σif for any open compact subgroup K⊂G(F), the function dimk(x)πK|xis
locally constant on Σ. For any x∈Spec(R), denote by (π|x)∨the smooth dual of π|x.
Theorem 1.3. Letπbe a ﬁnitely generated torsion-free smooth admissible R[G(F)]-module whose ﬁber
rank is locally constant on Σ. Assume moreover there exists a ﬁnitely generated torsion-f ree admissible
R[G(F)]-module ˜πsuch that for any x∈Σ,˜π|x∼=(π|x)∨. Then Conjecture 1.1holds for π.
Before explaining the proof, we make several remarks.
Remark 1.4.For the unramiﬁed twisting family π,
•the ﬁber rank is locally constant by construction;
•the underlying space /hatwiderMis connected and smooth;
•the family ˜πcan be taken as/braceleftBig
IG
P(σ∨χ−1)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleχ∈/hatwiderM/bracerightBig
.
Thus Theorem 1.3covers unramiﬁed twisting families.
Remark 1.5.The existence of the ’dual’ module ˜πand the locally constancy of ﬁber rank are necessary
for our approach (see the paragraphs after the remark). But t hese conditions do not impose very serious
restrictions:
•the locally constancy of ﬁber rank may holds for general ﬁnit ely generated torsion-free smooth
admissible R[G(F)]-modules. If π|xis absolutely irreducible for all x∈ΣandG= GLn, one can
deduce the localy constancy of ﬁber rank from the theory of co -Whittaker modules in [ 12];
•ifπ|xis absolutely irreducible for all x∈ΣandGis classical, one can construct the R[G(F)]-
module˜πfromπby the MVW involution (see [ 18]).
2Now we explain our approach to Theorem 1.3. We shall use the language of derived categories(See
Section 2for the basics). Let iG
HEbe the compact induction of the trivial representation EofH(F)and
H(K,E)be the level- KHecke algebra over E. Then by the Frobenius reciprocity law and Bernstein’s
decomposition theorem (see [ 2, Theorem 2.5(1)] etc), for properly chosen open compact sub groupK⊂
G(F)(see Proposition 3.2below)
mi(π|x) = dim k(x)Exti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK|x) = dim k(x)Hi/parenleftbig
RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK|x)/parenrightbig
.
By the following upper semi-continuous theorem, this simpl e observation reduces Theorem 1.3to
•the perfectness of (iG
HE)K∈D(H(K,E)), which we show in Proposition 3.3using the projective
resolutions of G(F)-representations in [ 14, Appendix];
•the projectiveness of the R-module ˜πKby our assumption on the locally constancy of ﬁber rank
(up to shrinking R, see Lemma 2.5below).
HereD(H(K,E))is the derived category of H(K,E)-modules.
Proposition 1.6 (Upper semi-continuous theorem) .For any complex M∈D(R),
•the function dimk(x)Hi(M⊗L
Rk(x))is upper semicontinuous for each iifMis pseudo-coherent,
i.e. quasi-isomorphic to a bounded above complex of ﬁnite fre eR-modules;
•the Euler Poincare number/summationtext
i(−1)idimk(x)Hi(M⊗L
Rk(x))is locally constant if Mis perfect
i.e. quasi-isomorphic to a bounded above and below complex of ﬁnite projective R-modules.
Proof. Item (i) is [ 21,Lemma 0BDI ] and Item (ii) is [ 21,Lemma 0BDJ ] /square
More precisely, Theorem 1.3holds if
(a)RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)is perfect and
(b) there is an isomorphism
RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)⊗L
Rk(x)∼=RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK|x).
As˜πKis projective, the isomorphism in (b) is equivalent to
RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)⊗L
Rk(x)∼=RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK⊗L
Rk(x)).
By the perfectness of (iG
HE)K∈D(H(K,E)), the isomorphism above holds by standard homological
algebra (see Lemma 2.2).
With(b)at hand, by the general criterion of perfectness given in Lem ma2.4below, the complex
RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)is perfect as Exti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)is ﬁnitely generated over R(see Lemma
3.1) and there is a positive integer Nsuch that for any closed point x,mi(π|x) = 0 for anyi≥N(see
Proposition 3.2).
Remark 1.7.We brieﬂy compare our approach with that in [ 2], which deals with unramﬁed twisting
families associated with (P,M,σ). By Frobenius reciprocity law,

Mis the normalized Jacquet module functor from Rep(G,C)toRep(M,C). Inloc.cit , the authors

whereδχis the skyscraper sheaf at χ−1. Then the locally constancy of Euler-Poincare numbers hold s
by the semicontinuity theorem for coherent sheaves over smo oth varieties. In comparison, our approach
seems more direct:
•it works over Gand does not depend on the special form of the family;
•it requires less results from representation theory (while more results from homological algebra).
We conclude the introduction by the local constancy of m(π|x)for a ﬁnitely generated smooth admis-
sible torsion-free R[G(F)]-module π.
Corollary 1.8. Assume the pair (G,H)is strongly tempered and
•the ﬁber rank of πis locally constant on Σand there exists a ﬁnitely generated smooth admissible
torsion-free R[G(F)]-module ˜πsuch that ˜π|x∼=(π|x)∨for anyx∈Σ,
•for anyx∈Σ,(π|x)⊗k(x),τCis irreducible and tempered for some ﬁeld embedding τ:k(x)֒→C.
3Thenm(π|x)is locally constant on Σifm(σ) = EP(σ)holds for all irreducible tempered σ∈Rep(G,C).
We remark that
•whenH(F)is compact, the upper semi-continuity of multiplicities ho lds under weaker assump-
tions (see Proposition 3.5below);
•when(G,H)is strongly tempered and Gelfand , i.e.m(σ)≤1for allσ∈Rep(G,C)irre-
ducible, the local constancy of multiplicities can be deduc ed from the upper semi-continuity and
the meromorphy property of canonical local periods conside red in [ 6] (see also [ 4] for analytic
families).
2.Homological algebra
For any (unital but possibly noncommutative) ring A, denote by ModA(resp.K(A)) the category
of leftA-modules (resp. complexes of A-modules). The derived category (D(A),q)consists a category
D(A)with a functor q:K(A)→D(A)such that any functor F:K(A)→ C(to any category) which
sends quasi-isomorphisms to isomorphisms factors uniquel y through q:K(A)→D(A)(see [15, Chapter
III, Section 2]). We usually denote the derived category by D(A). The tensor product and Hom functor
onModAadmit derived version on D(A)(see [21, Chapter 15] for Acommutative and [ 23] for general
A). In particular, we record that
•for anyA-algebra A′, viewed as a left A′-module and right A-module, the tensor product functor
A′⊗A−: Mod A→ModA′, M/mapsto→A′⊗AM
has the derived version
A′⊗L
A−:D(A)→D(A′).
Note that if M∈D(A)is represented by a bounded above complex P•∈K(A)of projective
A-modules, A′⊗L
AMis represented by A′⊗AP•;
•for anyN∈ModA, the functor
HomA(−,N) : Mod A→ModZ;M/mapsto→HomA(M,N)
has the derived version
RHom A(−,N) :D(A)→D(Z).
Note that if M∈D(A)is represented by a bounded above complex P•∈K(A)of pro-
jectiveA-modules, RHom A(M,N)is represented by the complex Hom(P•,N).Moreover, if
N∈ModAadmits a compatible left R-module structure for some commutative ring R, the
functorRHom A(−,N)admits a natural lifting, which we denote by the same notatio n,
RHom A(−,N) :D(A)→D(R).
The following results on base change morphisms in derived ca tegory are crucial to our approach. Re-
call that a complex M∈D(A)is called pseudo-coherent (resp. perfect ) if it is quasi-isomorphic to a
bounded above (resp. above and below) complex of ﬁnite free ( resp. projective) A-modules. Let Rbe a
commutative ring.
Lemma 2.1. LetA′be a ﬂatA-algebra and take N∈ModA′. Then for any pseudo-coherent M∈D(A),
there is a canonical isomorphism
RHom A(M,N)∼=RHom A′(A′⊗L
AM,N).
Proof. Assume Mis represented by the bounded above complex P•∈K(A)of ﬁnite projective A-
modules. Then RHom A(M,N)is represented by HomA(P•,N)andRHom A′(A′⊗L
AM,N)is represented
byHomA′(A′⊗AP•,N). The desired result follows from the canonical isomorphism
HomA(P,Q)∼=HomA′(A′⊗AP,Q)
for anyA-module PandA′-module Qand the exactness of A′⊗A. /square
Lemma 2.2. Assume that Ris commutative and N∈ModAadmits a compatible left R-module structure.
Then for any perfect M∈D(A)andP∈D(R), one has the canonical isomorphism
RHom A(M,N)⊗L
RP→RHom A(M,N⊗L
RP).
4Proof. Represent Mby a bounded above and below complex Q•of ﬁnite projective modules and Pby any
complex P•. ThenRHom A(M,N)⊗L
RPis represented by the total complex Tot(Hom A(Q•,N)⊗RP•)
andRHom A(M,N⊗L
RP)is represented by the complex Hom•
A(Q•,N⊗RP•)with
Homn
A(Q•,N⊗RP•) :=/productdisplay
n=p+qHomA(Q−p,N⊗RPq).
Note that for any W∈ModAﬁnite projective and V∈ModR, one has
HomA(W,N)⊗RV∼=HomA(W,N⊗RV).
Thus the complexes Tot(Hom A(Q•,N)⊗RP•)andHom•
A(Q•,N⊗RP•)are isomorphic and we are
done. /square
Lemma 2.3. Assume Ais an algebra over Rand letR′be a ﬂat commutative R-algebra. Then for
M∈D(A)pseudo-coherent and N∈ModA, the canonical morphism
RHom A(M,N)⊗L
RR′→RHom A⊗RR′(M⊗L
RR′,N⊗L
RR′)
is an isomorphism. In particular if Ais Noetherian, one has natural isomorphism
HomA(M,N)⊗RR′→HomA⊗RR′(M⊗RR′,N⊗RR′)
for any ﬁnitely generated M∈ModA.
Proof. Take a bounded above complex P•of ﬁnite free A-modules representing M∈D(A). Then
RHom A(M,N)⊗L
RR′is represented by HomA(P•,N)⊗RR′andRHom A⊗RR′(M⊗L
RR′,N⊗L
RR′)is
represented by HomA⊗RR′(P•⊗RR′,N⊗RR′). The desired result follows from the canonical isomorphism
HomA(P,Q)⊗RR′∼=HomA⊗RR′(P⊗RR′,Q⊗RR′)
for any ﬁnite free A-module Pand arbitrary A-module Q.
By [21, Lemma 064T], any ﬁnitely generated A-module is pseudo-coherent when Ais Noetherian and
the ’in particular’ part follows. /square
Now we turn to perfect complexes over commutative rings. Let Rbe a commutative Noetherian ring.
For anyx∈Spec(R), letk(x)be the residue ﬁeld.
Lemma 2.4. A complex M∈D(R)is perfect if the following conditions holds:
(i) theR-module Hi(M)is ﬁnitely generated for each i∈Z;
(ii) there exists a < b∈Zsuch that for all closed point x∈Spec(R),Hi(M⊗L
Rk(x)) = 0 ifi /∈[a,b].
Proof. By [21,Lemma 068W ], when Mis pseudo-coherent, Item (ii) implies Mis perfect. By [ 21,
Lemma 064T ] the assumption Ris Noetherian implies that all Hi(M)is pseudo-coherent. Thus by [ 21,
Lemma 066B ],Mis pseudo-coherent if Hi(M) = 0 for alli > b+ 1. To see this, consider the exact
sequence
0→pn/pn+1→R/pn+1→R/pn→0
for any maximal ideal p⊂R. By induction, one ﬁnds that Hi(M⊗L
RR/pn) = 0 for alli > b. By [ 21,
Lemma 0CQE ] and [ 21,Proposition 0922 ], one has the short exact sequence
0→R1limHi−1(M⊗L
RR/pn)→Hi(RlimM⊗L
RR/pn)→limHi(M⊗L
RR/pn)→0.
By [21,Lemma 0A06 ], one has
Hi(M)⊗RˆRp=Hi(Rlim
nM⊗L
RR/pn).
ThusHi(M)⊗RˆRp= 0for alli > b+1and all maximal ideal p⊂R. Consequently, Hi(M) = 0 for all
i > b+1and we are done. /square
Finally, we record the following result for a commutative No etherian ring R.
Lemma 2.5. For any ﬁnitely generated R-module M, the ﬁber rank function
β(x) : Spec( R)→N;x/mapsto→dimk(x)M⊗Rk(x)
is upper-semicontinuous. If Ris moreover reduced, then Mis projective iﬀ βis locally constant.
Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from Proposition 1.6. For the second part, see [ 21,Lemma 0FWG ]./square
53.Homological multiplicities
Let(G,H)be a spherical pair of reductive groups over p-adic ﬁeld F. LetIG
HCbe the space
{f:G(F)→Csmooth|f(hg) =f(g)∀h∈H(F), g∈G(F)}
on which G(F)acts by right translation and iG
HC⊂IG
HCbe the subspace consisting of functions which
are compactly supported modulo H(F). SinceH(F)is unimodular, IG
HCandiG
HCare just the normalized
induction and normalized compact induction of the trivial r epresentation CofH(F)respectively.
By [17, Proposition 2.5],
mi(σ) = dim CExti
G(F)(σ,IG
HC) = dim CExti
G(F)(iG
HC,σ∨),∀σ∈Rep(G,C).
For any compact open subgroup K⊂G(F), letH(K,C)be the Hecke algebra of C-valued bi- K-invariant
Schwartz functions on G(F). Then by Bernstein’s decomposition theorem (see [ 2, Theorem 2.5(1)] etc),
there exists a neighborhood basis {K}of1∈G(F)consisting of splitting (see [1] for the notation) open
compact subgroups such that H(K,C)is Noetherian, the subcategory M(G,K,C)of representations
generated by their K-ﬁxed vectors is a direct summand of Rep(G,C)and the functor σ/mapsto→σKinduces
an equivalence of categories M(G,K,C)∼=ModH(K,C). Thus for σ∨∈M(G,K,C)withKsplitting,
Exti
H(K,C)((iG
HC)K,(σ∨)K)∼=Exti
G(F)(iG
HC,σ∨),∀i∈Z.
Under our working hypothesis
the multiplicity m(σ)isﬁnite for all irreducible σ∈Rep(G,C),
iG
HCislocally ﬁnitely generated , i.e. for any compact open subgroup K⊂G(F),(iG
HC)Kis ﬁnitely
generated over H(K,C), by [1, Theorem A]. Thus for Ksplitting, (iG
HC)Kadmits a resolution by ﬁnite
projective H(K,C)-modules and consequently for σ∈Rep(G,C)such that σ∨∈M(G,K,C),
mi(σ) = dim CExti
H(K,C)((iG
HC)K,(σ∨)K)<∞,∀i∈N.
In particular, for any σ∈Rep(G,C)of ﬁnite length, mi(σ)is ﬁnite for all i. Finally by [ 17, Corollary
III.3.3], for any ﬁnite length σ∈Rep(G,C),mi(σ) = 0 fori > d(G), the split rank of G.
Now we change the coeﬃcient ﬁeld Cto a subﬁeld E⊂C. LetRep(G,E)be category of smooth
G(F)-representations over E. For any open compact subgroup K⊂G(F), letH(K,E)be the Hecke
algebra of E-valued bi- K-invariant Schwartz functions on G(F), andM(G,K,E)⊂Rep(G,E)be the
subcategory of representations generated by their K-ﬁxed vectors. For any σ∈Rep(G,E), set
mi(σ) := dim EExti
H(F)(σ,E),∀i∈N,EP(σ) :=/summationdisplay
i(−1)imi(σ).
LetiG
HE∈Rep(G,E)be the compact induction of the trivial H(F)-representation E. For any open
compact subgroup K⊂G(F),
Lemma 3.1. For any splitting open compact subgroup K⊂G(F), the Hecke algebra H(K,E)is Noe-
therian and (iG
HE)Kis ﬁnitely generated over H(K,E).
Proof. Note that (iG
HE)K⊗EC= (iG
HC)K. Take generators {yi=/summationtext

HC)KoverH(K,C)
withfi,j∈(iG
HE)K. LetV⊂iG
HEbe theH(K,E)-submodule generated by fi,j. Sinceyibelongs to
V⊗ECfor eachi, one has V⊗EC= (iG
HE)K⊗EC. Consequently, V=iG
HEandiG
HEis locally ﬁnitely
generated.
Take any ascending chain of left ideals of H(K,E)
I0⊂I1⊂ ··· ⊂In⊂ ···.
ThenIi⊗ECforms an ascending chain of left ideals of H(K,C)∼=H(K,E)⊗EC. SinceH(K,C)is
Noetherian, we have that for some n,
In⊗EC=In+1⊗EC=···.
Consequently, In=In+1=···andH(K,E)is Noetherian. /square
Proposition 3.2. For any σ∈Rep(G,E)such that σ∨∈M(G,K,E), the homological multiplicity
mi(σ) = dim EExti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,(σ∨)K)∀i∈N.
If moreover σhas ﬁnite length, then mi(σ)is ﬁnite for each i≥0and0fori > d(G). In particular,
EP(σ)is actually a ﬁnite sum.
6Proof. For anyσ∈Rep(G,E), setσC:=σ⊗EC. Then for any σ∈Rep(G,E)andθ∈Rep(G,C)
HomG(F)(σ,θ) = Hom G(F)(σC,θ).
Thus computing using any projective resolution of σ, one ﬁnds

By Lemma 3.1,(iG
HE)K∈D(H(K,E))is pseudo-coherent for Ksplitting. Thus by Lemma 2.3,
Exti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,(σ∨)K)⊗EC∼=Exti
H(K,C)((iG
HC)K,(σ∨
C)K)∀i≥0.
From the corresponding results for σC, one deduce that
•ifσ∨∈Rep(G,K,E),
mi(σ) = dim EExti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,(σ∨)K),∀i≥0,
•ifσhas ﬁnite length, mi(σ)is ﬁnite for all i≥0andmi(σ) = 0 ifi > d(G).
/square
Proposition 3.3. For any splitting open compact subgroup K⊂G(F),(iG
HE)K∈D(H(K,E))is perfect.
Proof. TakeV⊂iG
HCbe the sub-representation generated by (iG
HC)K. By [ 14, Appendix], Vadmits an
explicit bounded above and below resolution by projective o bjects in Rep(G,C)(actually for certain K,
the projective resolution can be made explicitly by the theo ry of Schneider-Stuhler, see [ 19, Theorem
II.3.1] and [ 16, Theorem 1.2]). Thus there exists a positive integer Nsuch that for any W∈ M(G,K,C),
Exti
G(V,W) = 0,∀i > N.
Note that σ/mapsto→σKinduces an equivalence between M(G,K,C)and the category of H(K,C)-modules
(see [2, Theorem 2.5(1)]). Since (iG
HC)K=VK, one ﬁnds
Exti
H(K,C)((iG
HC)K,M) = 0,∀i > N
for anyH(K,C)-module M. Thus by Lemma 2.3, for any H(K,E)-module M,
Exti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,M) = 0,∀i > N.
Take any resolution P•of(iG

by ﬁnite projective H(K,E)-modules. Let Q= coker(PN+2→PN+1). ThenQadmits a resolution
··· →PN+2→PN+1→0···
ThenExt1
H(K,E)(Q,M) = 0forM= ker(PN+1→Q). Consequently, PN+1=Q⊕MandQis projective.
Consequently, (iG

Now we prove Theorem 1.3. LetRbe a ﬁnitely generated reduced E-algebra and Σ⊂Spec(R)be a
Zariski denset subset of closed points. We restate Theorem 1.3for the convenience of readers.
Theorem 3.4. Letπbe a torsion-free smooth admissible ﬁnitely generated R[G(F)]-module whose ﬁber
rank is locally constant on Σ. Assume that there exists a ﬁnitely generated smooth admiss ible torsion-free
R[G(F)]-module ˜πsuch that ˜π|x∼=(π|x)∨for anyx∈Σ. Thenmi(π|x)is upper semi-continuous for
eachi∈NandEP(π|x)is locally constant.
Proof. Since splitting open subgroups form an neighborhood system of1∈G(F), one can take a splitting
open compact subgroup K⊂G(F)such that ˜πKgenerates ˜πand(iG
HE)K∈D(H(K,E))is perfect by
Proposition 3.3. Thus by Proposition 2.2,
RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)⊗L
Rk(x)∼=RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK⊗L
Rk(x))
By the duality between πK|xand˜πK|xand Lemma 2.5, upon shrinking Spec(R)to an open subset
containing Σwe can and will assume the ﬁber rank of ˜πUis locally constant on Σand thus the R-module
˜πUis ﬁnite projective. Thus
RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK⊗L
Rk(x))∼=RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK|x).
7By Lemma 2.1and Proposition 3.2, one has mi(π|x) = dim k(x)Exti
H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK|x).By Proposition
1.6, to ﬁnish the proof it suﬃces to show the complex RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)is perfect in D(R).
As(iG
HE)Kadmits a bounded above and below resolution P•by ﬁnite projective H(K,E)-modules,
the complex RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK)is represented by HomH(K,E)(P•,˜πK). Since ˜πKis ﬁnitely
generated over Rby the admissibility of ˜π,HomH(K,E)(P•,˜πK)is a complex of ﬁnitely generated R-
modules. Thus Hi(RHom H(K,E)((iG
HE)K,˜πK))are ﬁnitely generated as R-modules for each i∈Z. Now
the desired perfectness follows from Lemma 2.4and Proposition 3.2. /square
Finally, we remark that when H(F)is compact, the upper semi-continuity of mi(π|x)holds for all
torsion-free ﬁnitely generated smooth admissible R[G(F)]-modules π(here we do not assume the existence
of˜π).
Proposition 3.5. Assume H(F)is compact. Then for any torsion-free ﬁnitely generated smoo th ad-
missible R[G(F)]-module π, the function EP(π|x) =m0(π|x)is upper semi-continuous on Spec(R).
Proof. By [1, Theorem 2.14], mi(π|x) = 0 for each i≥1andEP(π|x) =m0(π|x)for anyx∈Spec(R).
LetπH(resp.πH) be the H(F)-coinvariant (resp. H(F)-invariant) of π. SinceH(F)is compact, the
natural map πH→πHis an isomorphism and for any x∈Spec(R),(πH)|x∼=(π|x)H∼=(π|x)H.In
particular, m0(π|x) = dim k(x)(π|x)H= dim k(x)πH|x. By Lemma 2.5to ﬁnish the proof, it suﬃces to
showπHis coherent.
Note that [ 2, Theorem 2.5(1)] actually works for any algebraically clos ed ﬁeld of characteristic zero.
Thus by Proposition 3.2, for each generic point ηofSpec(R)and some splitting open subgroup K
dimk(η)πH|η= dim k(η)HomG(F)((iG
Hk(η))K,(π|η)∨,K)<∞.
Thus there exists an open compact subgroup K′⊂G(F)such that πH|η⊂(π|η)K′for allη. Then for
anyv∈πHandk∈K′,k·v=vin/producttext
ηπ|η. Since the diagonal map π ֒→/producttext
ηπ|ηis injective, one has
k·v=vinπand consequently πH⊂πK′. AsπK′is coherent by the admissibility of π,πHis coherent
and we are done. /square
