ABSTRACT
Precise interstellar dust extinction laws are important to infer the in trinsic properties of reddened
objects and correctly interpret observations. In this work, we a ttempt to measure the optical–infrared
extinction laws of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) by using red supergiant
(RSG) stars and classical Cepheids as extinction tracers. The spe ctroscopic RSG samples are con-
structed based on the APOGEE spectral parameters, Gaia astro metric data, and multi-band photom-
etry. We establish the eﬀective temperature–intrinsic color relatio ns for RSG stars and determine the
color excess ratio (CER) E(λ−GRP)/E(GBP−GRP) for LMC and SMC. We use classical Cepheids to
derive base relative extinction AGRP/E(GBP−GRP). The results are 1 .589±0.014 and 1 .412±0.041
for LMC and SMC. By combining CERs with AGRP/E(GBP−GRP), the optical–infrared extinction
coeﬃcients Aλ/AGRPare determined for 16 bands. We adjust the parameters of RV-dependent ex-
tinction laws and obtain the average extinction laws of LMC and SMC as RV= 3.40±0.07 and
RV= 2.53±0.10, which are consistent with Gordon et al. (2003). In the optical bands, the adjusted
RVextinction curves agree with the observations with deviations less t han 3%.

1.INTRODUCTION
The interstellar extinction curve is the absorption and
scattering of starlight by dust as a function of wave-
length. It is crucial to correct the eﬀects of dust ex-
tinction and infer the intrinsic properties of reddened
objects. Besides, the extinction curve contains impor-
tant information about the interstellar dust grains, such
as the size distribution and composition. Accurate ex-
tinction curves are also essential in distance determina-
tion and galaxy structure studies. Current studies of
interstellar extinction are mainly concentrated on the
Milky Way. The Magellanic Clouds (MCs), including
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magel-
lanic Cloud (SMC), are satellite galaxies of the Milky
Way. They are low-metallicity dwarf galaxies and of-

properties in diverse galactic environments.
However, compared to the Milky Way, the stud-
ies of the LMC and SMC extinction curves are lim-
ited. In the last two decades, Gordon et al. (2003)
measured ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (IR) ex-
tinction curves of 24 sightlines in the MCs (19 in
the LMC and ﬁve in the SMC). Gao et al. (2013)
investigated the mid-IR extinction law and its vari-
ation in the LMC. Ma´ ız Apell´ aniz et al. (2014) and
De Marchi et al. (2016) studiedthe extinctionlawofthe
Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) in the LMC at diﬀerent
bandsbasedondiﬀerentdataandmethods, respectively.
Ma´ ız Apell´ aniz & Rubio (2012) calculated the UV ex-
tinction law for four stars in a quiescent cloud in the
SMC.Yanchulova Merica-Jones et al. (2017) measured
the extinction curve of a ∼200 pc×100 pc region in the
southwest bar of the SMC. Hagen et al. (2017) analyzed
the UV extinction curve and its regional variation in the
SMC. Thesestudies havefocused on limited sightlinesof2 Wang & Chen
O- and B-type stars or on particular regions. Hence, it
is necessary to study the extinction law covering a wider
area of the LMC and SMC.
To measure the extinction curves, two methods are
commonly used. One is the “pair method”, which
is widely applied to spectroscopic data or the spec-
tral energy distribution (SED) of multi-band photo-
metric data. The other is the color-excess method
for photometric data. The “pair method” calculates
the extinction curve by comparing the observed spec-
trum (or SED) of a reddened star with that of an
unreddened star (or the theoretical stellar spectrum) of
the same spectral type. O- and B-type stars are of-
ten taken as extinction tracers as they are very bright
and easy to observe (e.g., Fitzpatrick & Massa 1990 ,
2007;Gordon et al.2003 ;Ma´ ız Apell´ aniz & Rubio2012 ;
Ma´ ız Apell´ aniz et al. 2014 ;Fitzpatrick et al. 2019 ;
Gordon et al. 2021 ). However, the small number of
these stars and their location in atypical environments
limit their widespread application. Besides, the selec-
tion of spectral templates and the zero point at spectral
comparison can lead to systematic errors in extinction
measurements. The color-excess method computes the
ratio of two color excesses (CEs), E(λ−λ1)/E(λ1−λ2),
for a group of stars based on the linear ﬁtting of CE–
CE diagrams. With the known distance, the total-to-
selective extinction ratio, Aλ/E(λ−λ1), can be derived
from the slope of the reddening vector on the color-
magnitude diagrams (CMDs, Nishiyama et al. 2009 ;
De Marchi et al. 2016 ;Yanchulova Merica-Jones et al.
2017). Red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump
(RC) stars are appropriate tracers because their intrin-
sic color indices are relatively consistent or easy to mea-
sure (e.g., Indebetouw et al. 2005 ;Flaherty et al. 2007 ;
Zasowski et al. 2009 ;Gao et al. 2009 ,2013;Wang et al.
2013,2017;Wang & Chen 2019 ). RGB stars and RC
stars are numerous and very bright in the IR, and they
are good tracers of the IR interstellar extinction. How-
ever, the contaminationbyothertypes ofstarsisaprob-
lem. Moreover, the adoption of constant intrinsic color
indices of RGB stars and RC stars also introduces er-
rors in extinction estimates, because they are closely
related to stellar parameters such as eﬀective tempera-
ture, metallicity, and surface gravity. Furthermore, the
absolute magnitude of RC stars is also not constant, but
related to the metallicity and age ( Wang & Chen 2021 ).
These problems can be eﬀectively solved only when the
spectral parameters of the tracers are available.
In summary, stars used as extinction tracers have the
following characteristics: 1) they are very luminous,
which allows us to detect distant or high extinction re-
gions; 2) The intrinsic color index is almost invariant,or can be inferred from their stellar parameters. In this
work, we propose to use red supergiant (RSG) stars and
classical Cepheids as tracers to determine the dust ex-
tinction. RSG stars are massive stars with masses rang-
ing from ∼8 to 30 M⊙. Typically, RSG stars have
high luminosities of ∼4000−400000L⊙, low eﬀec-
tive temperatures of ∼3300−5000K, and radii up
to 1500 R⊙(Levesque et al. 2005 ;Massey et al. 2007 ;
Wittkowski et al. 2012 ;Davies et al. 2013 ;Yang et al.
2018,2021;Ren et al. 2021 ). They are the descendants
of H-burning O- and B-type massive stars and thought
to evolve horizontally on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R)
diagram. The main advantage of using RSG stars as ex-
tinction tracersis that they are 4 −8magnitude brighter
thanRGBstarsorRCstars. Besides,RSGstarsarevery
young and often present near dusty clouds. Thus, RSG
stars can be used to study the extinction of high extinc-
tion regionsorevenofothergalaxiesinthe LocalGroup.
Moreover, the intrinsic color indices of RSG stars can be
well estimated from their stellar parameters.
In this work, we explore whether RSG stars can be
used as tracers of interstellar extinction and combine
them with classical Cepheids to study dust extinction
in the LMC and SMC. Based on the APOGEE (the
Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experi-
ment,Eisenstein et al. 2011 ;Majewski et al. 2017 ) sur-
vey data, we select a group of RSG stars with high-
quality stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical
abundances. We establish the eﬀective temperature
Teﬀ–intrinsic color relations of RSG stars to obtain CE
values. The color excess ratios (CERs) are determined
by using the color-excess method based on RSG stars.
With the help of classical Cepheids, we derive the base
relativeextinction AGRP/E(GBP−GRP). Afterthat, we
convert the CERs into the relative extinction Aλ/AGRP
and obtain the optical to IR dust extinction curves of
the LMC and SMC. In addition, we discuss the eﬀects of
circumstellar dust and variability of RSG stars on their
adoption as interstellar extinction tracers.
The sketch of this paper is as follows. The description
of data sets and the construction of the RSG sample
are presented in Section 2. We also provide a catalog
of spectroscopic RSG stars in Section 2. In Section 3,
we describe the method to derive the relation between
Teﬀand intrinsic color indices for RSG stars. The de-
termination of CERs and relative extinction is also in
Section3. In Section 4, we analyze the optical to IR ex-
tinction and reddening curves of the LMC and SMC by
comparing the observations with the models. Then we
adjust the RV-dependent extinction laws. We compare
our extinction law with previous works in Section 5. We
also discuss the eﬀects of the possible presence of cir-LMC & SMC Extinction Law 3
cumstellar dust around RSG stars and the variability
of RSG stars on the determination of LMC and SMC
interstellar extinction in Section 5. We summarize our
main conclusions in Section 6.
2.DATA AND SAMPLE
2.1.Data
To determine the extinction law of MCs, we collected
spectroscopic data from APOGEE, and optical to near-
IR photometric data from the Gaia, MCPS (Magel-
lanic Clouds Photometric Survey, Zaritsky et al. 2002 ,
2004), SMSS (SkyMapper Southern Survey, Wolf et al.
2018), SMASH (Survey of the Magellanic Stellar His-
tory,Nidever et al. 2017 ), and 2MASS (Two Micron All
Sky Survey, Skrutskie et al. 2006 ) surveys.
2.1.1.Gaia
The third Gaia data release, Gaia DR3, con-
tains a full astrometric solution for about 1.46 bil-
lion sources brighter than 21.0 mag in Gband
(Gaia Collaboration et al.2022 ). Italsoprovidesbroad-
band photometry in the G,GBP,GRPbands for
more than 1.5 billion sources and the radial veloc-
ity measurements for about 33 million bright stars
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022 ). The astrometric data
in Gaia DR3 are the same as those of Gaia early DR3.
The typical uncertainties for proper motion and mean
G-band photometry are 0 .02−0.04 mas yr−1atG <15,
1 mmag at G= 17 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021 ).
In this work, we use the Gaia proper motion and ra-
dial velocity to exclude foreground stars. Then, we use
Gaia photometric data to determine the extinction law
of MCs.
2.1.2.APOGEE
APOGEE is a high-resolution ( R∼22,500) near-
IRH-band (15000 −17000˚A) spectroscopic survey
(Majewski et al. 2017 ). It observed the sky by using the
2.5-meter Sloan Telescope at the Apache Point Obser-
vatory and the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at the Las
CampanasObservatory( Gunn et al. 2006 ;Wilson et al.
2019). We used data from the latest released DR17
(Abdurro’uf et al. 2022 ). DR17 is a component of the
fourth phase of Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS-IV,
Blanton et al. 2017 ) and contains data and information
for 657,135 unique targets in the Milky Way and nearby
satellite galaxies. It provides the derived stellar proper-
ties, including radial velocities, stellar atmospheric pa-
rameters (e.g, Teﬀ, surface gravity log g, and metallicity
[M/H]), and individual chemical abundances (e.g. C, N,
O, other α, iron-peak elements). Typical internal uncer-
tainties in the stellar atmospheric parameters are 27 K
inTeﬀ, 0.04 dex in log g, and 0.01 dex in [M/H].2.1.3.MCPS
The MCPSsurveyobservedthe central18deg2areaof
the SMC ( Zaritsky et al. 2002 ) and 64 deg2area of the
LMC (Zaritsky et al. 2004 ) by using the Las Campanas
Swope 1-meter telescope. It provides an MCPS catalog
withUBVIphotometricdata. IntheMCPScatalog,for
the brightest 0.02% stars with BorV <13.5 mag, their
U,B,Vphotometry has been replaced by Massey’s cat-
alog (UBVRbright star survey of the LMC and SMC,
Massey 2002 ). Note that Massey’s catalog only covers
14.5 deg2of the LMC, a quarter of the area covered
by the MCPS catalog, so most stars in the MCPS cat-
alog with BorV <13.5 mag still have suspect pho-
tometry after replacing the photometry with Massey’s
catalog. For SMC stars, the I-band photometry has
been replaced by the OGLE photometry (Optical Grav-
itational Lensing Experiment, Udalski et al. 1998 ) for
bright stars with I <13.5 mag. The photometric uncer-
tainties of stars with good quality should be less than
0.4 mag in the Uband and 0.2 mag in the B,V,Ibands
(Zaritsky et al. 2002 ).
2.1.4.SMSS
SMSS is a southern hemisphere image survey using
the dedicated 1.3-meter SkyMapper telescope at Siding
Spring Observatory in Australia ( Wolf et al. 2018 ). The
DR1 catalog presents data from the shallow survey in-
cluding objects with ∼8−18 mag in all six bands: u,v,
g,r,i, andz(Wolf et al.2018 ). ThelatestDR2 includes
a part of the main survey (100 second exposures), with
the limit magnitudes reaching 21st magnitude in the g
andrbands (Onken et al. 2019 ). By the end of the
survey, the photometry depths can reach 20 −22 mag
in all six bands ( Onken et al. 2019 ). We use the data
published in DR2 which has a precision of 1.0% in u
andvbands, and 0.7% in g,r,i,zbands as measured by
internal reproducibility ( Onken et al. 2019 ).
2.1.5.SMASH
The SMASH survey is an NOAO survey project
using the NOAO Blanco 4-meter telescope lo-
cated at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
(Nidever et al. 2017 ). It observed about 480 deg2
of the Magellanic system (the MC main bodies and
the Magellanic periphery) with deep u,g,r,i,z images
(Nidever et al.2017 ). Depending on the exposuretimes,
the photometric coverage ranges from ∼16 mag (shal-
low,∼60 s) to 24 −25 mag (deep, ∼300 s). We use
the latest DR2 data with the photometric precision of
0.10, 0.07, 0.05, 0.08, and 0.05 mag in u,g,r,i, andz
band, respectively ( Nidever et al. 2021 ). For the bright-4 Wang & Chen
est stars, the completeness decreases. Hence, this work
only uses uandgbands.
2.1.6.2MASS
2MASS is an all-sky survey in the near-IR J,H, and
KSbands by using two 1.3-meter diameter telescopes
located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo,
Chile (Skrutskie et al. 2006 ). The 10 σdetection depths
of the point source are 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3mag in the J,
H, andKSbands, respectively ( Skrutskie et al. 2006 ).
We use data from the 2MASS all-sky catalog of point
sources ( Cutri et al. 2003 ).
2.2.The Spectroscopic RSG Catalog
We construct a spectroscopic RSG sample mainly
based on astrometric data from Gaia and spectroscopic
data from APOGEE. First, we use the Gaia parameters
to exclude the foreground Galactic stars. The speciﬁc
constraints are as follows:
1. the location, 64◦<R.A. <94◦,−74◦<Decl. <
−63◦for LMC and 3◦<R.A. <25◦,−76◦<
Decl. <−70◦for SMC;
2. the proper motion (PM) for LMC and SMC,
0.0 mas yr−1<PMR.A.<2.5 mas yr−1and
−2 mas yr−1<PMDecl.<2 mas yr−1;
3. the radial velocity (RV), RV >200 km s−1(LMC)
and RV>100 km s−1(SMC);
4. remove stars with parallaxes satisfy both ̟ >0
and|̟−0.02|>3×̟errfor LMC, satisfy both
̟ >0 and|̟−0.0166|>3×̟errfor SMC.
The left panel of Figure 1displays the selection of the
RSG sample in the Gaia ( GBP−GRP) vs.GCMD. The
gray dots are the foreground Galactic sources, while the
turquoise dots are the LMC (top) and SMC (bottom)
sources. The LMC and SMC sources mainly include
RSG stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and
RGB stars. We take the LMC CMD diagram (top left
panel of Figure 1) as an example. The interstellar ex-
tinction causes the position of the star to shift from the
upper left to the lower right, as does the broadening of
RSG stars (red dots). Overall, the LMC extinction is
not signiﬁcant. The turquoise dots distributed at the
lower right of the red dots are mainly AGB stars, which
are elongated in the color GBP−GRP. This elonga-
tion is mainly caused by the diﬀerent temperatures and
the diﬀerent circumstellar dust. The turquoise dots dis-
tributed below and parallel to the red dots are mainly
RGB stars, which can also be used to measure the ex-
tinction law, but with a larger uncertainty, as discussed
in Section 5.4.The right panel of Figure 1illustrates the distribution
of LMC (top) and SMC (bottom) stars (turquoise dots)
in theTeﬀvs. loggdiagram. We further selected RSG
stars using the APOGEE parameters. For this purpose,
we analyzed the distribution of the APOGEE parame-
tersofthe RSG candidates, wherethearrowsin Figure 1
indicate their approximate positions on the CMDs (see
also Fig. 9 of Yang et al. 2021 ). Finally, the follow-
ing APOGEE parametric and photometric criteria were
determined to select RSG stars:
1. the surface gravity log g <2;
2. metallicity −0.6dex<[M/H]<−0.4dex (LMC)
and−1.0dex<[M/H]<−0.7dex (SMC);
3.α-elemental abundance −0.06dex<[α/M]<
0.02dex (LMC) and −0.12dex<[α/M]<
0.00dex (SMC);
4.KS<12.0 mag.
Afterapplyingtheaboveconstraints,substantialRGB
and AGB stars were removed. We further excluded pos-
sible AGBstarsbasedonmulti-bandCMDs. SinceAGB
stars have larger observed color indices and lower Teﬀ
than RSG stars, we remove them if they lie in the red
sequences of both the Gaia ( GBP−GRP) vs.Gand
the 2MASS ( J−KS) vs.KSCMDs. Meanwhile, we
check whether these ejected stars are located at the low-
temperature end of the Teﬀvs. loggdiagram. This
check prevents us from removing RSG stars with high
extinction. Our ﬁnal RSG sample contains 1,073 stars
(LMC) and 398 stars (SMC), shown as red dots in Fig-
ure1. For the LMC RSG sample, most stars are in
3700K≤Teﬀ≤4500K and 0 .3<logg <1.0. For the
SMC RSG sample, most stars are in 3900K ≤Teﬀ≤
4650K and 0 .2<logg <1.0.
We adopted a radius of 1′′to cross-matched the spec-
troscopic RSG sample with photometric catalogs listed
in Section 2.1. The RSG stars are in the one-to-one
match. When crossed with Gaia, there are two RSG
stars with double-matched objects. In the G-band, the
brightnessratiosoffaintandbrightstarsare1%and8%.
If the angular resolution of other bands is worse than
1′′, the faint stars cannot be distinguished, resulting in
a blending eﬀect. If the temperature of the faint star
is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that of the RSG star, this
will lead to a bias in our determined intrinsic color and
CE. Here, only two stars have a weak blending problem,
and the eﬀect onthe results iscompletely negligible. For
the 2MASS bands, the angular resolution is around 2′′.
Using a 2′′radius crossed with Gaia, we found 169 stars
with blending problems. However, the vast majorityLMC & SMC Extinction Law 5

have a small eﬀect on the IR luminosity, with an over-
all eﬀect of 0.3%. The eﬀect on the IR CE is less than
0.002 mag, which is also negligible. Yang et al. (2018)
also conﬁrmed that there is no signiﬁcant blending for
near-IR and mid-IR photometry in selecting RSGs can-
didates.
We present a catalog of spectroscopic RSG stars, in-
cluding 1073 stars in LMC and 398 stars in SMC. This
catalog gives the positions of the RSG stars (R.A.,Decl.), the stellar parameters ( Teﬀ,logg, and [M/H]),
the multi-band photometry with uncertainties (Gaia,
MCPS, SMASH, SMSS, and 2MASS), and the derived6 Wang & Chen
CEE(GBP−GRP)1. A portion of the catalog is shown
in Table 1for guidance regarding its form and content.
Massey & Olsen (2003) provided a catalog of 118 red
stars toward the SMC and 167 red stars toward the
LMC, of which 89% and 95% are RSG stars, respec-
tively. After cross-matchingwith ourcatalogbyaradius
of 1′′, we found that 45 RSG stars (28%) of LMC and 36
RSG stars (34%) of SMC are in our sample. The main
diﬀerence between our RSG sample and Massey’s sam-
ple is that we chose a sample with a more concentrated
metallicity. We found that APOGEE data are available
for 112 (LMC) and 80 (SMC) RSG stars in Massey’s
sample. After applying our [M/H] and [ α/M] criteria,
49 (LMC) and 44 (SMC) remain. Then, after further re-
moving possible contaminants according to multi-band
CMDs and Teﬀvs. loggdiagram, 45 (LMC) and 36
(SMC) are ﬁnally left. The metallicities of our RSG
sample (∼1000 RSG stars) are concentrated in the 0.2
dexrange,whilethemetallicityofMassey’ssamplehasa
large dispersion, with about half of the RSG stars hav-
ing metallicities below the lower limit of our selection
criterion. For these low-metallicity RSG stars, the cal-
culation of the intrinsic color would be less accurate. In
addition, Massey’s sample consists of the brightest RSG
stars, and most of them have more circumstellar dust,
so we did not include Massey’s sample in this work.
Yang et al. (2019,2021) andRen et al. (2021) also
provided the LMC and SMC RSG catalogs. After in-
tegrating their catalogs and cross-matching them with
APOGEE data, we obtained a combined catalog of 1846
(LMC)and626(SMC)RSGstars. Wefound1040(97%)
and 392 (99%) of our RSG stars are in the combined
catalog. This indicates that our selected RSG stars are
reliable.
2.3.The RSG Sample for Measuring Extinction
To study interstellarextinction with our selected RSG
stars, we also need to remove sources with circumstellar
dust. Evolved RSG stars may have a dusty circumstel-
lar envelope due to mass loss. Dust absorbs UV/optical
photons and radiates in the IR bands. If there is dust
around RSG stars, it may lead to IR CE. Therefore, IR
bands are often used to indicate stars with circumstellar
envelopes. For example, Flaherty et al. (2007) adopted
mid-IR colors to exclude sources with circumstellar
dust, such as pre-main-sequence stars, AGB stars, and
1For RSG stars in our catalog, 89 stars in the LMC and 26 stars
in the SMC do not have E(GBP−GRP) values. These stars were
not used to study the extinction because they were excluded b y

circumstellar dust tied to RSG stars ( van Loon et al.
2005;Bonanos et al.2010 ;Boyer et al. 2011 ;Yang et al.
2018). We also tried to use IR colors to remove RSG

3.THE OPTICAL TO IR EXTINCTION CURVES
In this section, we describe the method and procedure
for determining the wavelength-dependent extinction
law. First, we establish the Teﬀ–(λ−GRP)0relations
to estimate the ( λ−GRP)0of each RSG star. Then, we
calculate the CEs and perform a linear ﬁt to the CE–CE
plots to obtain the CERs E(λ−GRP)/E(GBP−GRP).
After that, we determine the base relative extinction
AGRP/E(GBP−GRP) based on classical Cepheids. Fi-
nally, we convert the CERs into the Aλ/AGRPand de-
termine the optical to IR extinction curves.
3.1.Intrinsic Colors
Ducati et al. (2001) suggested that the stellar intrin-
sic color can be derived from the zero-reddening curve
delineated by the blue envelope of Teﬀversus observed
color diagrams. They derived the intrinsic colors for
stars with all spectral types and luminosity classes in
the Johnson system. Wang & Jiang (2014) further de-
veloped this method and established Teﬀ–near-IR in-
trinsic color relations for K-type giants with 3500K ≤
Teﬀ≤4800K. They selected the bluest 5% of stars
in each interval of ∆ Teﬀ= 50 K on the Teﬀversus
observed color diagram to represent the unreddened
blue edge and determined the Teﬀ–intrinsic color re-
lation by quadratic function ﬁtting. In addition, thisLMC & SMC Extinction Law 7

method has been applied to derive the intrinsic colors
of diﬀerent types of stars in multiple bands, such as
giants with 3600K ≤Teﬀ≤5200K in mid-IR bands
(Xue et al. 2016 ) and optical bands ( Wang et al. 2017 ),
dwarfs with 3850K ≤Teﬀ≤8400K and giants with
3650K≤Teﬀ≤5200K in IR bands ( Jian et al. 2017 ),
and dwarfs with 6500K ≤Teﬀ≤8500K in UV and
optical bands ( Sun et al. 2018 ).
We adopted this approach to determine the intrinsic
colors of our RSG stars. We ﬁrst plotted Teﬀversus
the observed color ( λ1−λ2) diagrams. The selection of
the bluest stars can be done on any Teﬀvs. (λ1−λ2)
diagram. We selected the bluest 30% of stars in each
interval of ∆ Teﬀ=50/100K (LMC/SMC) on the Teﬀvs.
2MASS ( J−KS), Gaia (GBP−GRP), and SMSS ( g−r)
diagrams. Their intersection is considered to be the
unreddened RSG stars, which make up about 10% of
all RSG stars. This process ensures that the selected
bluest stars are indeed unreddened stars for a small-size
sample. Figure 2showsTeﬀvs. (λ1−λ2) diagrams for
the LMC RSG sample (gray dots). The selected unred-
dened stars are shown as magenta asterisks (top panels
of Figure 2). These stars are also located at the edgeof the bluest colors in other bands (see the middle and
bottom panels of Figure 2). We ﬁtted these stars with a
cubic polynomial function to obtain the Teﬀ–(λ−GRP)0
relations (see blue dashed lines in Figure 2). Finally,
the intrinsic color indices ( λ−GRP)0are derived for
three Johnson bands U,B,V, two Gaia bands GBP,G,
two SMASH bands u,g, ﬁve SMSS bands v,g,r,i,z,
and three 2MASS bands J,H,KS. The intrinsic color
indices can be expressed as:
(λ−GRP)0=a3(logTeﬀ)3+a2(logTeﬀ)2
+a1(logTeﬀ)+a0, (1)
where the correspondingcoeﬃcients for each color index
are listed in Table 2. The root-mean-squareerrors(RM-
SEs) of these equations are also list in this table. Other
reported Teﬀ–intrinsic color relations for RSG stars are
presented in Table 3. The corresponding applicable re-
gions and references are also listed.
Compared to the previous Teﬀ–intrinsic color rela-
tions, our relations are based on a larger sample and
takes into account higher-order terms. According to the
common bands, we compared the relations of Teﬀvs.

Note: The Teﬀ–(λ−GRP)0relations are applicable to estimate the intrinsic color in dices of RSG stars from their Teﬀ. For
the LMC relations, they are suitable for RSG stars with param eters in the range of 3700K ≤Teﬀ≤4500K, 0 .3<logg <1.0,
and−0.6dex<[M/H]<−0.4dex. For the SMC relations, they are suitable for RSG stars w ith parameters in the range of
3900K≤Teﬀ≤4650K, 0 .2<logg <1.0, and−1.0dex<[M/H]<−0.7dex.
SMC result is in excellent agreement (∆ = 0 .017±0.020
mag) with that of Dorda & Patrick (2021), and our
LMC result is consistent (∆ = −0.066±0.004 mag)
with that of Neugent et al. (2012). The overall trend
ofBritavskiy et al. (2019)’s result is diﬀerent from the
literature’s results and ours (see Fig. 3 of his paper for
details). For ( V−KS)0, the overall trend of our LMC
and SMC results are consistent with Levesque et al.
(2006), with an overall deviation of ∼0.3 mag (∆ =−0.35±0.07, ∆ = −0.23±0.02). This systemic bias in
intrinsic color indices does not aﬀect the further deter-
mination of the CER, which is the slope of a linearly ﬁt
of the CE–CE plot. The scatters are comparable to the
RMSEs of the relations.
In the optical and uband, the intrinsic color index
depends not only on the Teﬀbut also on the [M/H] and
logg. We examined the eﬀects of [M/H] and log g. We
found that their eﬀects on the derivation of the intrinsicLMC & SMC Extinction Law 9

colors are negligible due to the very narrow range of
[M/H] and log gvalues of the RSG stars we chose.
Another advantage of our intrinsic color calculation
method is that we no longer need to subtract the Galac-
tic extinction separately. The observed magnitude mλ
of RSG stars in the LMC/SMC is composed of three
components: the absolute magnitude m0, the Galac-
tic extinction AMW, and the local extinction AMC. In
this section, we establish the Teﬀ–intrinsic color rela-
tions based on the selected unreddened RSG stars in the
Teﬀvs. (λ1−λ2) diagram. These selected unreddened
sources do not suﬀer from the local extinction, namely
AMC= 0. However, the foreground Galactic extinction
AMWof these stars is not zero. Therefore, the Teﬀ–
intrinsic color relations also contain the eﬀects of the
foreground Galactic extinction. In subsequent CE cal-
culations, the CE is the observed color index (including
AMWandAMC) minus the intrinsic color index (includ-
ingAMW). The resulting CE naturally subtracts the
foreground Galactic extinction. Therefore, we no longer
need to assume the foreground extinction of the Milky
Way and avoid introducing additional uncertainties in
the CE calculation.
3.2.Color Excess Ratios
Basedon the Teﬀ–(λ−GRP)0relations, the ( λ−GRP)0
is derived. The observed color ( λ−GRP) is the diﬀer-
ence between two observed magnitudes. The CE is then
determined by E(λ−GRP) = (λ−GRP)−(λ−GRP)0.
We performed a linear ﬁt of the CE–CE plots to ob-
tain the CERs. Figure 3is an example that displays
the CER E(λ−GRP)/E(GBP−GRP) determination for
RSG stars in the LMC, where λare SMASH u, Johnson
B,V, GaiaG, SMSSg,r,z, and 2MASS J,KSbands,respectively, from the top left to the bottom right. The
CE–CE diagrams of LMC RSG stars in the other bands
and SMC RSG stars are presented in Appendix Fig-
uresA1,A2, andA3. The gray dots are the objects
with deviations exceeding 2 σ, which are excluded from
a statistical point of view. The red dots are the ﬁnal ob-
jects used to perform the linear ﬁt, while the black lines
are the best linear ﬁt lines. The CERs are the slopes of
these lines.
Since many RSG stars in MCs are located in the low-
extinction region, and the number of stars with diﬀerent
extinction is not uniformly distributed, the formal error
of the CER σ1obtained by ﬁtting all RSG stars may be
underestimated relative to the actual error. We subdi-
vided the samples by ( GBP−GRP)>−0.05+0.01∗n,
wherenvaries from 0 to 29 for LMC, from 0 to 14 for
SMC. A linear ﬁt was applied to each subsample to de-
termine the slope. To avoid the eﬀect on the slope due
to the variation of the intercept, we ﬁx the intercept.
This ﬁxed intercept value was determined by the whole
sample and was very close to 0. The standard deviation
of the slopes σ2was determined. The errorsin photome-
try, as well as the errors in estimating the intrinsic color
(λ−GRP)0, are also propagated to the slope. the errors
in photometry for the Gaia and SMSS bands are small,
ranging from 0.003 to 0.02 mag, and for the 2MASS
bands, ranging from 0.02 to 0.03 mag. The mean er-
ror in the Uband is the largest, around 0.07 mag.
Among the intrinsic colors, errors of ( G−GRP)0and
(GBP−GRP)0are the smallest at 0.01 to 0.02 mag. The
intrinsic color errors in the UV bands are the largest,
reaching 0.2 to 0.3 mag. We used Monte Carlo simu-
lation to estimate the propagated errors. In the sim-
ulation, the number of data points and the amount of10 Wang & Chen
extinction were kept consistent with the observations,
and the error on the x,y-axes is the larger one among
the photometric error and the intrinsic color error. We
performed a linear ﬁt to the simulated data points to
obtain the slope. Then we repeated the simulation 1000
times and calculate the standard deviation of the slope
σ3. Thisstandarddeviationwasfound tobe comparable
or slightly smaller than the observation-based slope er-
rorσ2. This is understandable because when we choose
the CEE(GBP−GRP) with the smallest error as the
x-axis, the error in the y-axis will be fully considered
in the ﬁt. The relevant analysis can also be found in
Section 4.2 of Wang & Chen (2019). The ﬁnal error of
the CER is estimated by σCER=/radicalbig
σ2
1+max(σ2,σ3)2.
For each band, the determined CERs and their errors
are listed in Table 4.
3.3.Relative Extinction
The relative extinction Aλ/AGRPcan be converted
from the CER by the equation
Aλ
AGRP= 1+kλE(GBP−GRP)
AGRP, (2)
wherekλrepresents the CERE(λ−GRP)
E(GBP−GRP). To obtain
the value ofAλ
AGRP,AGRP
E(GBP−GRP)is required. The relative

value.
The accuracy of the relative extinction is determined
bytheaccuracyofthestellardistanceandabsolutemag-
nitude estimations. For the LMC, the distance disper-
sion of young stars is small, while for the SMC, the dis-
tance dispersion will be larger. For the absolute mag-
nitudes, the error of the best absolute magnitudes ob-
tained from the spectra is about 0.2 to 0.3 mag. Consid-
ering the small extinction of LMC and SMC, this error
implies that we will not be accurate enough to estimate
the relative extinction using spectroscopic RSG stars.
For this reason, we consider using the classical Cepheid
to estimate the relative extinctionAGRP
E(GBP−GRP), since
the period–luminosity relation of Cepheids can predict
an absolute magnitude with an error of only 0.08 mag.
We used Cepheids in Gaia DR3 ( Ripepi et al. 2022 )
and established period–color relations GBP−GRP=
f(logP) for the fundamental mode and the ﬁrst-
overtone mode Cepheids, respectively. Then Cepheids
with low extinction were selected by −0.16<(GBP−
GRP)−f(logP)<−0.08, where 0.08 is the 1 σdis-
persion of the period–color relations. The selected low-
extinction Cepheids account for about 15% of the total
Cepheids, and they were used to determine the period–
intrinsic color relation log P–(GBP−GRP)0and theperiod–luminosityrelationlog P–MGRP. Theserelations
were then used to estimate E(GBP−GRP) andAGRP
for all Cepheids. For example, our determined period–
intrinsic color relation for LMC fundamental Cepheids
is (GBP−GRP)0= (0.263±0.006)logP+(0.606±0.004).
Please note that this relation may deviate from the op-
timal log P–(GBP−GRP)0relation by a small amount,
so it is only suitable for analyzing extinction laws and
not for measuring the absolute amounts of extinction.
Another method to obtain the log P–(GBP−GRP)0and
logP–MGRPrelations is subtracting the extinction ob-
tained from the external extinction map. We derived
(GBP−GRP)0= (0.278±0.008)logP+(0.575±0.005),
which is close to the relation determined by the former
method. The diﬀerence between these two methods in
determining the value ofAGRP
E(GBP−GRP)is verysmall. This
is becauseAGRP
E(GBP−GRP)is the slope of two sets of extinc-
tion (i.e., Figure 4), which is largely independent of the
zeropointsoftheintrinsiccolorandabsolutemagnitude.
We performed a linear ﬁt to 3181LMC Cepheids (fun-
damental mode and ﬁrst-overtone mode Cepheids) and
1906 SMC Cepheids (only fundamental mode Cepheids)
with positive extinction and CE values. Figure 4shows
an example of determiningAGRP
E(GBP−GRP). The results for
LMC and SMC are AGRP= (1.508±0.013)×E(GBP−
GRP) + 0.026,σLMC= 0.082 and AGRP= (1.340±
0.041)×E(GBP−GRP)+0.068,σSMC= 0.147, respec-
tively.σLMC= 0.082 is dominated by the error in the
estimation of the Cepheid’s absolute magnitude, while
σSMC= 0.147 contains an additional distance modulus
dispersion of about 0.12 mag for the SMC Cepheids.
Nevertheless, they are both much smaller than the er-
rors in the RSG absolute magnitudes estimated with
spectral parameters (0 .2−0.3 mag). If we used the rela-
tions log P–(GBP−GRP)0and logP–MGRPdetermined
by the external extinction map, the extinction laws ob-
tained are AGRP= (1.498±0.013)×E(GBP−GRP) and
AGRP= (1.286±0.041)×E(GBP−GRP) for LMC and
SMC. The diﬀerence is 0 .6σand 0.9σ, which indicates
that the extinction law is little aﬀected by the zero point
of the intrinsic colors and absolute magnitudes.
The relative extinction AGRP/E(GBP−GRP) based
on Cepheids needs a small correction to be used for
RSG stars, since the temperature of Cepheids is about
1500 K higher. We adopted the synthetic stellar spectra
(Lejeune et al. 1997 )Fλfor the Cepheid and the RSG
withTeﬀ, logg, and [Fe/H] values according to the aver-
age stellar parameters. For LMC Cepheids, we adopted
Teﬀ= 5500 K, log g= 1.5 and [Fe/H] = −0.5, while for
LMC RSG stars, we adopted Teﬀ= 4000 K, log g= 0.5

4.RESULTS
4.1.RV-dependent Optical–IR Extinction
The Galactic wavelength-dependent extinction curves
can be described by a one-parameter function of RV.
RV=AV/E(B−V) =AV/(AB−AV) is the ra-
tio of the total extinction to the selective extinc-
tion (Cardelli et al. 1989 , hereafter CCM). The aver-
age extinction curve for the Galactic diﬀuse interstel-
lar medium (ISM) is RV∼3.1 (Cardelli et al. 1989 ;Fitzpatrick & Massa2007 ;Schlaﬂy & Finkbeiner 2011 ).
Wang & Chen (2019) investigated the Galactic extinc-
tion law and obtained an average extinction curve with
signiﬁcantlyimprovedaccuracy. Thedeterminedextinc-
tioncurvecanbeexpressedasan RV= 3.16±0.15curve,
but is at least 10 −20% lower than the CCM extinction
curve at wavelengths longer than 600 nm.
To determine the RV-dependent extinction law of the
LMC and SMC, we compared our multi-band extinction
coeﬃcients with diﬀerent CCM model extinction curves
shown in Figure 5and Figure 6. Our derived optical
to IR extinction coeﬃcients are shown as red-ﬁlled cir-LMC & SMC Extinction Law 13

cles with red error bars. For LMC, the CCM RV=
3.4, 3.1, and 2.5 model extinction curves are plotted as
blue, black, and green lines, respectively. The larger the
RVvalue, the ﬂatter the curve. The bottom panel of
Figure5presents the ratio of the model extinction coef-
ﬁcient from CCM RV= 3.4 (blue), 3.1 (black), and 2.5
(green) curves to our observed extinction coeﬃcient Aλ
(Model)/ Aλin each band. Figure 6is for SMC, and the
CCMRV= 3.1, 2.6, and 2.1 model extinction curves
are plotted as black, green, and blue lines, respectively.
The bottom panel of Figure 6shows the comparison of
the model extinction coeﬃcient from CCM RV= 3.1
(black), 2.6 (green), and 2.1 (blue) curves with our ob-
served results Aλ(Model)/ Aλ.In the wavelength range of 300 −550 nm, the extinc-
tion law of both LMC and SMC deviates slightly from
the CCM RV= 3.1 curve. The LMC extinction law
is close to the CCM RV= 3.4 curve, while the LMC
extinction law is close to the RV= 2.6 curve.
In the 550 −900 nm wavelength range, our LMC ex-
tinction coeﬃcients are up to 10% lower than the CCM
RV= 3.4 extinction coeﬃcients (Figure 5). The SMC
extinction curve shows similar results, i.e., the observed
extinction is 10% lower than the CCM RV= 2.6 ex-
tinction curve (Figure 6). These imply that the CCM
extinction curves need to be adjusted in the wavelength
range of 550 −900 nm to match observations. This ad-
justment is also been suggested in the analysis of the ex-
tinction curve of the Milky Way ( Wang & Chen 2019 ).14 Wang & Chen

be best ﬁtted by the adjusted RV= 2.6 curve (red dashed line). Bottom panel: comparison of model extinction curves to the observed
extinction in ratio.
We speculate that the CCM extinction law is slightly
overestimated in this wavelength range since their re-
sult is based on only one band ( Rband, 770 nm).
In IR bands (0 .9µm< λ < 3µm), the extinc-
tion law follows a power law Aλ∝λ−α, indepen-
dent of the adopted RVvalue. The power-law in-
dex of the CCM extinction curve is a ﬁxed value of
α= 1.61. Based on accurate photometry and paral-
lax of Gaia, a pure RC sample from APOGEE, and
a robust determination method, Wang & Chen (2019)
recommended a steep average near-IR extinction with
α= 2.07. Compared to the value of α= 1.61,
recent studies reported larger values, ranging from
1.9 to 2.6 (see Chen et al. 2018 ;Wang & Chen 2019 ;
Hensley & Draine 2021 ;Sanders et al. 2022 , and refer-ences therein). The uncertainties of our IR measure-
ments are large. It is because the IR extinction and
CEs of LMC and SMC are generally small, resulting in
a large uncertainty in the CER measurements. There-
fore, in this work, we did not attempt to constrain the
power-law index of the near-IR extinction law. It is
worth noting that for the IR extinction correction of the
MCs, if the V-band extinction is AV=1 mag, then the
diﬀerence in the KS-band extinction obtained using dif-
ferent extinction laws (with a power-law index of α=
1.61 or 2.07) is only 0.02 mag, which is comparable to
the photometric error.
The mid-IR extinction in 3 µm< λ <30µm does not
approach zero with increasing wavelength. Many obser-
vations show that the Galactic extinction law in 3 µm<LMC & SMC Extinction Law 15
λ <8µm is relativelyﬂat acrossa diversityof sight lines
and values of RV(seeGao et al. 2009 ;Wang et al. 2013 ,
2015;Xue et al. 2016 ;Hensley & Draine 2021 , and ref-
erences therein). For the LMC extinction, Gao et al.
(2013) also reported a ﬂat 3 −8µm extinction law. At
long wavelengths (8 −30µm), the Galactic extinction is
dominated by two silicate absorption features centered
at 9.7µm and 18 µm (Draine 2003 ).
CCM extinction law contains two main functions: A
and B. Function A is the fundamental RV= 3.1 ex-
tinction curve, while function B shows the oﬀset of any
givenRVfrom the RV= 3.1 extinction curve. To bet-
ter describe the observed extinction, we adjusted the
parameters of CCM extinction law . For function A, we
kept it the same as Wang & Chen (2019, see Equation 9
of their work), which has been adjusted according to the
Galactic extinction law. For function B, we kept it the
same as the CCM in the optical band, while adjusted it
in the near-IR band to ensure a smooth extinction pro-
ﬁle. The ﬁnal adjusted RV-dependent extinction laws
are shown below.

As seen in Figure 5and Figure 6, our adjusted RV= 3.4
andRV= 2.6 extinction curves (red dashed lines) are
more consistent with the observations than the corre-
sponding CCM extinction curves. Compared to obser-
vations, the maximum inconsistency of our extinction
curves in the optical band is only 3% for LMC.
We estimated the RVvalues of LMC and SMC by
comparing the observed relative extinction with the ad-
justedRV-dependent extinction laws. To avoid the in-
ﬂuence of the bias of the extinction coeﬃcients at long
wavelengths on the determination of RVvalues, we onlyusedAλ/AGRPwithλ <700nm. The determined total-
to-selective extinction ratios are RV= 3.40±0.07 and
2.53±0.10 for LMC and SMC, respectively. For LMC,
ourRVvalue is consistent with the average result RV=
3.41±0.06 from Gordon et al. (2003), which is based
on a sample of ten sightlines. Diﬀerent RVvalues have
also been reported near the 30 Doradus star formation
region, such as 2 .76±0.09(Gordon et al. 2003 ), 5.6±0.3
(De Marchi et al. 2014 ), 4.4±0.7 (Ma´ ız Apell´ aniz et al.

ourRVvalueagreeswith theaverageresultof2 .74±0.13

aroundtheSMCbar. Forasmallregioninthesouthwest
bar of the SMC, a similar value of R475=A475/(A475−
A814) = 2.65±0.11 was derived by using RC stars
(Yanchulova Merica-Jones et al. 2017 ). Our results are
not biased to any speciﬁc environment, cover the entire
LMC and SMC, and represent the average extinction
laws.

tion curve with RV= 3.4. The CCM extinction curves with RV
= 3.4 (blue line), 3.1 (black line), 2.5 (green line) are also shown.
4.2.Optical–IR Reddening Curve
The reddening curve,E(λ−GRP)
E(GBP−GRP), is also used to in-
fer the extinction law, especially when the base relative
extinction, such asAGRP
E(GBP−GRP),AGBP
AGRP, is not available.
In this subsection, we discussed the feasibility of using
the reddening curve to infer the extinction law. Fig-
ure7shows the optical–IR reddening curve of the LMC
represented by the CER E(λ−GRP)/E(GBP−GRP).
Our adjusted RVextinction curve and CCM RVextinc-
tion curves were converted to reddening curves by the
equation E(λ−GRP)/E(GBP−GRP) = (Aλ/AGRP−16 Wang & Chen
1)/(AGBP/AGRP−1). The LMC CERs are ﬂatter than
the CCM reddening curves but agree well with our ad-
justedRV= 3.4 reddening curve. This also indepen-
dently proves the reliability of our adjusted extinction
law.
Compared to extinction curves (Figure 5), the diﬀer-
ences between the diﬀerent RVis smaller on the redden-
ing curves (Figure 7). It can be explained by the fact
that the CER is the result of smoothing two relative
extinction values. In IR bands, the CERs of the black
line (RV= 3.1 andα= 1.61) and the red dashed line
(RV= 3.4 andα= 2.07) are close. It indicates that it is
diﬃcult to determine the extinction law, i.e., RVor the
power-law index α, using one or several IR CERs. This
problem can be reduced by combining optical and IR
multi-band CERs. , The RVcan be derived from multi-
band CERs if the accuracy of CERs is good enough.
Since this approach requires high-precision CERs, the
intrinsic color index must be determined from spectro-
scopic data and even for stars with relatively consistent
intrinsic color indices (such as RC stars). Otherwise,
small errors in CERs can lead to large uncertainty in
the extinction law.
It is also worth emphasizing that we recommend us-
ing bands with high photometric accuracy, such as Gaia
GBPandGRPbands, as the x-axis of the CE–CE dia-
gram to reduce the error of CER caused by the ﬁtting
method. More discussions about the eﬀects of CE er-
ror on the measurement of the CER was presented in
Wang & Chen (2019).
5.DISCUSSION
5.1.Comparison with Previous Works
Wecomparedourdetermined RVvalueswithreported
measurements in the literature. Table 5listed some
reported RVvalues, the investigated regions, and the
adopted tracers. Figure 8shows the comparison. Our
LMCextinctionareshownasredsquareswitherrorbars
andcanbe representedbythe RV= 3.4extinctioncurve
(red line). Our SMC extinction (blue diamonds with er-
ror bars) are signiﬁcantly steeper than that of LMC and
can be represented by the RV= 2.6 extinction curve
(blue line). Gordon et al. (2003) measured the LMC
(black line) and SMC (green line) average extinction
curves. Our LMC and SMC extinction curves agree well
with the results of Gordon et al. (2003) in the optical
bands. The uncertainties of our relative extinctions are
relatively small in most of the bands. Moreover, our re-
sults nicely complement the absence ofextinction curves
between 0.55 to 1 µm inGordon et al. (2003).
In the IR JHKSbands, the extinction coeﬃcients in
the literature exhibit signiﬁcant discrepancies, as shownin Figure 8. These discrepancies can be explained by
the small IR extinction resulting in a large uncertainty
in the extinction coeﬃcient. The extinction in the IR
1.0 to 2.5 µm wavelengths is only 30% to 8% of that in
theV-band. For low extinction galaxies like MCs, the
accuracy of the average IR extinction law is diﬃcult to
improve further. Nevertheless, the IR extinction law is
already suitable for most stars in MCs to correct their
extinction.
Several studies have investigated the extinction law
of the Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus, a star-forming
region) in the LMC. For example, Gordon et al.
(2003) reported RV= 2.76 (LMC2, orange line),
De Marchi et al. (2016) derived RV= 5.6 (black aster-
isks). The extinction curve of LMC2 is comparable to
that of our SMC. In contrast, the extinction curve of
De Marchi et al. (2016) is the ﬂattest. These works sug-
gest that the extinction law of the LMC may vary with
the environment, ifthe errorsinabsolutemagnitudeand
intrinsic color are well constrained.
Note that the dispersion of our LMC and SMC RV
values is smaller than that of the Galactic RVvalue
fromWang & Chen (2019). The error of RVmainly
comes from AGRP/E(GBP−GRP), which determined by
thedistanceandtheabsolutemagnitude. Wang & Chen
(2019) used RC stars with Gaia distance errorsless than
10%, which is larger than the errors of LMC Cepheids’
absolute magnitude (0.08 mag). In addition, compared
to the LMC and SMC, the interstellar environment of
the Milky Way is more complex, so the dispersion of the
Galactic RVvalue would be larger.
5.2.The Eﬀects of Circumstellar Dust
The mass-loss rate of RSG stars in LMC and
SMC has been reported to range from about 10−4
to 10−11yr−1(e.g.,van Loon et al. 2005 ;Riebel et al.
2012;Groenewegen & Sloan 2018 ). The heavy mass loss
leads to the formation of the envelope and circumstel-
lar dust. We discussed the eﬀects of circumstellar dust
on the adoption of RSG stars as interstellar extinction
tracers. Circumstellar dust absorbs UV/optical photons
and re-radiates in the IR. The dust absorption causes
the observed color index of a star to be redder than
that without circumstellar dust. Although interstellar
extinction alsoleadsto areddeningofthe observedcolor
index, multi-band interstellar extinction satisﬁes the ex-
tinction law, while circumstellarextinction does not and
varies dramatically from star to star. In addition, the
dust emission caused by circumstellar dust leads a steep
increase of the IR ﬂux in one to several bands, and the
observed IR color indices can deviate signiﬁcantly from
the linear relation between two color indices. Therefore,LMC & SMC Extinction Law 17

we can check the presence of circumstellar dust in our
selected RSG stars based on multi-band color–color di-
agrams. We ﬁnd that the color–color diagrams of our
spectroscopic RSG sample all show a good linearity, in-
dicating that our bands of interest are almost unaﬀected
bycircumstellardustandthat thereddeningofobserved
color indices is a result of interstellar extinction.
In addition, IR colors of RSG stars are com-
monlyused todetect circumstellardust ( van Loon et al.
2005;Bonanos et al. 2010 ;Boyer et al. 2011 ;Yang et al.
2018). Dense circumstellar dust envelopes are more
likely to form around RSG stars with large mass-
loss rates and low stellar photospheric temperatures
(van Loon et al. 2005 ).Bonanos et al. (2010) found
that most RSG stars in the SMC have little dust, and
only the brightest sources show excess emission could
come from circumstellar dust. This was conﬁrmed by
Boyer et al. (2011). They further found that only the
brightest 7% of LMC RSG stars and 2% of SMC RSG
stars form a signiﬁcant amount of warm circumstellar
dust. Therefore, after examining the multi-band colors
of RSG stars, we excluded RSG stars with circumstellardust by using KS−W2<0.13 mag before investigating
the interstellar extinction (see Section 2.3).
Checking whether what we are studying is interstel-
lar dust can also be conﬁrmed by an external compar-
ison with the extinction map. Considering that RSG
stars are young stars, we used the extinction map of
Cepheids for comparison. Cepheids are usually consid-
ered to have a negligible amount of circumstellar dust.
Joshi & Panchal (2019)determinedthereddeningof133
segments in the LMC based on ∼4500 Cepheids. The
spatial resolution of this reddening map is 1.2 deg2.
Based on the positions of our LMC RSG stars, we
selected the closest segment to obtain the reddening
E(B−V). A foreground extinction E(B−V) = 0.05
mag were subtracted and then E(B−V) was converted
intoE(GBP−GRP) byE(GBP−GRP)/E(B−V) =
0.757±0.016from Wang & Chen (2019). Given that we
are comparing the internal consistency of the extinction
maps, the choice of these parameters will not aﬀect our
analysis. In Figure 9, theE(GBP−GRP) of RSG stars
(see Section 3.2) is compared to the E(GBP−GRP) from
Cepheid’s reddening map. Overall, the two extinction
maps are in excellent agreement, e.g., the maximum ex-18 Wang & Chen

and Decl .∼ −69.5◦). This consistency also suggests
that the reddening or extinction we analyzed is domi-
nated by interstellar dust.
5.3.The Eﬀects of Variability
The variability of RSG stars is prevalent
(Schwarzschild 1975 ;Kiss et al. 2006 ;Yang & Jiang
2011;Yang et al. 2018 ;Chatys et al. 2019 ;Ren & Jiang
2020). Compared to AGB stars, RSG stars have smaller
amplitudes and reduced variability from the optical to
IR bands. Here, we tried to investigate the impact of
variability on the adoption of RSG stars to measure
interstellar extinction.
For our LMC RSG sample, we found 360 stars (33%)
with detectable amplitudes out of 1073 RSG stars by
analyzing RMSEs estimated by Gaia multi-epoch pho-
tometry. Among them, only 45 stars (4%) have large
amplitude, i.e., >0.3 mag in the G-band,>0.2 mag
in theGRP-band, and >0.1 mag in the near-IR KS-
band. For the KS-band, the single observation error
due to variability is less than 0.03 mag for most RSG
stars, which is comparable to the photometric error.
In optical bands, we used magnitude based on multi-
epoch photometry, so the eﬀect of variability on mag-
nitude is limited. Moreover, the variation of RSG starshas a much smaller eﬀect on intrinsic colors, since it
depends on Teﬀ, which changes very little during light
variation. For example, the Betelgeuse (a nearby bright
RSG star) dims from 0.5 mag to 1.61 mag in the V-
band, while its Teﬀdrops only slightly from 3650 K to
3600 K ( Levesque & Massey 2020 ). This variation in
Teﬀis comparable to the measurement uncertainty of
Teﬀ. Our analyses are all based on the intrinsic color of
RSG stars, so the eﬀect of variations on the extinction
measurements is negligible.
5.4.Extinction Traced by RGB Stars
RGB stars are often used as extinction tracers in the
IR (see Section 1). We also tried to use spectroscopic
RGB stars to measure the extinction curves of MCs.
BasedonAPOGEEparameters, weselectedabout 3,000
bright LMC RGB stars with H <13 mag, 3600K ≤
Teﬀ≤4200K, and 0 ≤logg≤1.2. Then we adopted
the same procedure as for RSG stars in Section 3to
establish the Teﬀ–(λ−GRP)0relations and estimate the
CERs. However, we found that although the number of
RGB stars is three times of RSG stars, the RGB stars
are almost all located in the low-extinction part of the
CE–CE diagram with E(GBP−GRP)<0.2 mag. This
leads to signiﬁcant uncertainty in the CER, i.e., slope,
obtained by linearly ﬁtting the CE–CE plot. Currently,LMC & SMC Extinction Law 19

the adoption of RGB stars with APOGEE spectra to
measure the extinction of MCs is not very suitable. In
this work, we ﬁnally chose RSG stars to determine the
optical to IR CERs.
5.5.The Predicted Extinction in CSST Bandpasses
Based on the determined extinction law, we pre-
dicted the relative extinction in the bandpasses of the
China Space Station Telescope (CSST). The CSST is
a 2-meter aperture survey telescope and a major sci-
ence project of the China manned space program ( Zhan
2021). The CSST will perform high-resolution, large-
area multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopy sur-
veys. It will observe about 17500 deg2of the sky in the
wavelength range of 0.25–1 µm, including photometric
measurements in seven bands (NUV standing for near-
UV,u,g,r,i,z,y) and slitless spectroscopic measure-
ments in three bands (GU, GV, GI). The 5 σlimiting
magnitude of the point source can reach 26 (AB mag)
or deeper in the gandrbands. In the future, CSST
data will be suitable for studying the UV-band extinc-
tion of the MCs. Based on our LMC and SMC extinc-
tion curves, we determined the relative extinction values
Aλ/AVof the CSST bandpasses. The extinction coeﬃ-
cients predicted from the eﬀective wavelength of Vega2
are listed in Table 6.
6.CONCLUSION
We have investigated the optical to IR dust extinc-
tion law of LMC and SMC using RSG stars and classi-
cal Cepheids as tracers. Cepheids are used to determine
2The eﬀective wavelengths of the CSST are taken from the SVO
Filter Proﬁle Service, http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/th eory/fps3/.the base relative extinction AGRP/E(GBP−GRP), while
RSG stars are used to determine the multi-band CERs
E(λ−GRP)/E(GBP−GRP). The multi-band photomet-
ricdataarecollectedfromGaia,MCPS,SMSS,SMASH,
and 2MASS surveys. We construct a spectroscopic RSG
sample based on APOGEE DR17, with selection crite-
ria including stellar parameters ( Teﬀ, logg, [M/H], and
[α/M]), photometry, and Gaia astrometric data. RSG
stars are distributed throughout the LMC and SMC,
hence, our measurements represent the average extinc-
tion laws. The main results of this work are as follows.
1. We present a catalog of spectroscopic RSG stars,
including 1073 stars in LMC and 398 stars in
SMC. This catalog provides the positions of the
RSG stars (R.A., Decl.), the stellar parameters
(Teﬀ, logg, and [M/H]), the multi-band photom-
etry with uncertainties (Gaia, MCPS, SMASH,
SMSS, and 2MASS), and the derived color excess
valuesE(GBP−GRP).
2. We established the Teﬀ–intrinsic color relations
and determined the intrinsic colors of RSG stars
withTeﬀin the range of 3700K ≤Teﬀ≤4500K
(LMC) and 3900K ≤Teﬀ≤4650K (SMC). We
determined multi-bands CEs and CERs E(λ−
GRP)/E(GBP−GRP), including one Gaia band
(G), three Johnson bands ( U,B,V), two SMASH
bands (u,g), ﬁve SMSS bands ( v,g,r,i,z ), and
three 2MASS bands ( J,H,K S).
3. We used classical Cepheids to estimate the base
relative extinction AGRP/E(GBP−GRP) since the
absolute magnitude of Cepheids can be deter-
mined more precisely than that of RSG stars. The20 Wang & Chen

extinction in the wavelength range of 300-550 nm.
In the long-wavelength bands of 550-900 nm, in-
cluding the Gaia bands, the CCM extinction curve
overestimated by up to 10% compared to the ob-
servations.
5. To better describe the observed extinction laws of
LMC and SMC, we adjusted the RV-dependent
extinction laws. According to our extinction laws,
the total-to-selective extinction ratios of LMC
and SMC are RV= 3.40±0.07 and RV=
2.53±0.10. Compared with previous works, our
LMC and SMC extinction laws are consistent with
Gordon et al. (2003) and complement their ab-
sence of extinction values between 0.55 to 1 µm.

is small in our RSG sample. Based on the LMC
