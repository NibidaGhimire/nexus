Weak gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) carries imprints of the
physics operating at redshifts much lower than that of recombination and serves as an important
probe of cosmological structure formation, dark matter physics, and the mass of neutrinos. Re-
construction of the CMB lensing deection eld through use of quadratic estimators has proven
successful with existing data but is known to be sub-optimal on small angular scales ( ` >3000)
for experiments with low noise levels. Future experiments will provide better observations in this
regime, but these techniques will remain statistically limited by their approximations. We show
that correlations between uctuations of the large-scale temperature gradient power of the CMB
sourced by ` <2000, and uctuations to the local small-scale temperature power reveal a lensing
signal which is prominent in even the real-space pixel statistics across a CMB temperature map. We
present the development of the Small Correlated Against Large Estimator (SCALE), a novel estima-
tor for the CMB lensing spectrum which oers promising complementary analysis alongside other
reconstruction techniques in this regime. The SCALE method computes correlations between both
the large/small-scale temperature gradient power in harmonic space, and it is able to quantitatively
recover unbiased statistics of the CMB lensing eld without the need for map-level reconstruction.
SCALE can outperform quadratic estimator signal-to-noise by a factor of up to 1.5 in current and
upcoming experiments for CMB lensing power spectra C

I. INTRODUCTION
Gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave back-
ground (CMB) by cosmological structures along the line
of sight has become a standard observational tool to
probe the content and evolution of the universe; see
Ref. [1] for a review. Improvements in measurements
of the CMB with telescopes like the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT,[2]), the South Pole Telescope (SPT,[3])
and the Planck satellite [4] have unveiled the uctuations
in the temperature and polarization signal of this primor-
dial light down to arcminute scales. Gravitational lensing
distorts our view of this primordial radiation, imparting
non-stationary statistics that can be teased apart from
the primordial uctuations [5{7].
Extracting (or `reconstructing') this signal from CMB
temperature Tand/or polarization EandBmaps can
proceed via a number of approaches. The pioneering
work of Refs. [8, 9] developed the concept of the quadratic
estimator (QE) for the lensing signal, which combines
pairs of observed maps TT,EE,BB,TE,TB, andEB,
to `reconstruct' the lensing potential eld. Lensing recon-
struction via the QE has been successful with existing
data. The iterative EBestimator [10, 11] is especially
eective at large angular scales ( L.1000) due to the
transfer of power from Emodes into Bmodes, the lat-
ter of which contains only a meager signal in the primary
CMB caused by a possible epoch of cosmic ination. Ap-
plication of the QE on Planck data has allowed for a 40 
detection of gravitational lensing [6]. However, the eec-
tiveness of the QE may soon be limited as experiments
push to smaller scales and lower noise. Indeed, the re-cent analysis of a set of very deep SPTpol data showed
improved results compared with the more standard QE
approach [12]. The QE formalism, which approximates
the full maximum likelihood estimate of the signal, is
statistically sub-optimal on small angular scales and in
low-noise regimes [10, 11, 13{16].
The derivation of the QE procedure relies on the as-
sumption that lensing is a weak eect, in the sense that
it has only a small eect on the statistics of the CMB
sky. This is an appropriate approximation for most of the
regimes in which the QE has historically been applied,
but at lower noise levels, this approximation quickly be-
gins to break down. On small angular scales, at `2000,
the power resulting from gravitational lensing dominates
over the primordial unlensed power spectrum, as can be
seen in Figure 1. In this lensing-dominated regime, QE
techniques are sub-optimal in the limit of low noise lev-
els. Figure 1 also shows that the additive bias N(0)
Lfrom
theTTreconstruction noise becomes lower than that
of the iterative EB estimator at small angular scales
(L&2000) due to increasing noise from the EBesti-
mator. The noise power is greater than the signal power
at these scales; however, this bias can be removed with
well-established methods [17, 18]. Bias from higher-order
reconstruction noise N(1)
Lalso need to be estimated and
removed at small angular scales [19]. Recent advances
in computation and statistical methodology allow for the
computation of the full maximum likelihood lensing map
[13, 15, 20] thereby surpassing the performance of QE
techniques in simulated data.
Quadratic estimators can also be shown to be sub-
optimal in the small-scale, low-noise limit because theyarXiv:2302.13350v1  [astro-ph.CO]  26 Feb 20232
are weighted by the sky-averaged variance of the large-
scale modes, despite precise measurement of the large-
scale modes. Due to cosmic variance on large scales, this
weighting contributes to excess variance in the lensing re-
construction. This limitation can be circumvented with
the the so-called `Gradient Inversion' approach to recon-
struction [14, 16, 21] which, unlike the QE technique,
is not limited by cosmic variance exhibited by the large
scale temperature uctuations.
Quadratic estimators and other estimators like the gra-
dient inversion estimator aim to reconstruct a map of the
underlying lensing potential explicitly . A reconstructed
map of the lensing eld is valuable for delensing [19, 22{
25] and for cross-correlation with other maps of large
scale structure [e.g. 7, 26{34], but the lensing power spec-
trum carries valuable information even without an associ-
ated map-level reconstruction. Phenomena which impact
matter clustering can be constrained using measurements
of the matter power spectrum, without requiring a map
of overdensities. Examples include the eects of neutrino
mass and related quantities [35{38], dark matter interac-
tions [39{41], ultralight dark matter [42, 43], warm dark
matter [44], and baryonic feedback [45].
Our goal is to devise a simple estimator that can
leverage the low-noise and high-resolution maps expected
from future CMB surveys to measure the small-scale
lensing power spectrum. We present the Small Corre-
lated Against Large Estimator (SCALE), a new method
of obtaining the small-scale lensing power constructed
from the cross-correlation between maps of the local
large-scale and small-scale temperature power. This es-
timator is complementary to reconstruction techniques
aimed at estimating a map of the lensing potential. It
is similar in spirit to the maximum likelihood, maxi-
mum a posteriori, Gradient Inversion, and Bayesian tech-
niques [13, 15, 16, 20] in that it aims to make optimal
use of lensing information at small-scales of a CMB tem-
perature map. In contrast to the QE method, SCALE is
designed to work on small angular scales, which leverages
the ongoing improvements to detectors and telescopes in
the coming decade [46{50]. SCALE specically aims to
avoid the extra variance incurred by QE techniques due
to cosmic variance of the large-scale CMB temperature
gradient, while also circumventing the highly correlated
nature of QE errors at small angular scales. In contrast
to the gradient inversion method described above, the
SCALE pipeline consists of high-pass and low-pass l-
tered maps which are squared and then cross-correlated
to estimate the lensing power spectrum directly, rather
than a map of the lensing potential.
We start with a brief review of CMB lensing in Sec-
tion II and develop a simple test in real space to illustrate
the principles of our proposed method in Section III. We
further develop this method, and present the SCALE pro-
cedure in Section IV. After introducing our data simula-
tions in Section V, we present our results in Section VI
and conclude in VII.

Note that the rst term is a cross-term between the ze-
roth and second order terms of Eq. (3), and the second
term is a product of the rst order term with itself. Sim-
ilar to Eq. (3), it expresses that the lensed CMB tem-
perature power contains a convolution between the lens-
ing potential power and the original CMB temperature
power. The eects of weak gravitational lensing on the
CMB do not add or remove from the total CMB tem-
perature varianceR

lensing serves to redistribute power CTT

troughs in the observed power spectrum (as can be seen
in Figure 1); the power redistributed to scales `&4000

ature modes which are suppressed by diusion damping.
Traditional estimators of the lensing potential take ad-
vantage of the correlations between angular modes that
have been introduced, and they work to reconstruct the
lensing potential eld through measurement of these o-
diagonal couplings. We can make approximations to sim-
plify Eq. (4) in the small-scale limit `2000. The

can be enforced with `0`in Eq. (4). One can applythese approximations to arrive at a simplied represen-
tation of the lensed CMB temperature power on small
scales (e.g., §4.1.3 of Ref. [1]):

the rst term of Eq. (4) which contains a small amount
of the unlensed CMB temperature power suppressed by
diusion damping crossed with a second-order lensing
contribution. We may also include contributions from
instrument noise, foregrounds, and other secondaries in
CTT

A straightforward method to estimate the small-scale
lensing power is to simply divide the observed excess
small-scale temperature power by the average unlensed
temperature gradient power on large scales. That is, we
can rework Eq. (5) and estimate the small scale lensing
power spectrum as

for`2000. The motivation for our SCALE technique
is that we can do better than Eq. (6), even without re-
constructing a map of the lensing eld. In any given
patch of sky, the large-scale temperature gradient power
around the line-of-sight ^nwill deviate from the sky aver-
age due to random uctuations. As a consequence, the lo-
calsmall-scale temperature power that results from lens-
ing will also deviate from the sky average. By correlating
the spatial variations in the locally measured large-scale
temperature gradient power with the spatial variations
in the small-scale temperature power, we can construct
an improved estimate of the small-scale lensing power.
Furthermore, variations in the observed small-scale tem-
perature power that are due to sources other than lens-
ing (such as non-stationary noise or astrophysical fore-
grounds), are not expected to correlate with variations
in the large-scale temperature gradient power since these
eects result from survey choices or local physics unre-
lated to the long wavelength uctuations responsible for
the large-scale temperature gradients.
In summary, we propose a new lensing estimator with
a similar form to Eq. (6). The key dierence is allowing
thelocal small-scale lensed temperature power to uctu-
ate according to the steepness of the background temper-
ature gradient in the same part of the sky:

Eq. (6) is recovered by taking the sky average of this
version. We consider combinations of CMB temperature4
maps because temperature-based lensing reconstruction
out-performs polarization-based estimators on small an-
gular scales, due to the fact that polarization maps be-
come dominated by noise at these angular scales (see
Figure 1). The lensing estimator we propose shares
some similarities with techniques used to measure the ki-
netic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) eect through variations
in small-scale temperature power [52].
In the following section, we present a simple proof-of-
concept that takes advantage of the local map-space
correlations between the small-scale temperature
power and the square of the observed temper-
ature gradient amplitude in order to tease out the
statistics of the underlying lensing potential eld.
III. INTRODUCTORY CONCEPTS IN REAL
SPACE
Before describing the harmonic-space implementation
of SCALE in this work, we start with an illustrative real-
space description of the concept to provide the intuition
and motivation for the techniques we develop in the fol-
lowing section. We introduce the notation X(^n) along
with shorthand Xto indicate the local average of a quan-
tityXnear a line-of-sight ^n.
The total observed small-scale CMB power along a
given line of sight T2
S(^n) is given by the 2-dimensional
(2D) angular integral over Eq. (7). We also specify the
large-scale temperature gradient amplitude jrTL(^n)jto
still be approximately constant near each single line of
sight while allowing for the small uctuations between
dierent lines of sight as described in the previous sec-
tion. Since we do not expect the lensing potential eld
to strongly correlate with the remaining contributions to
the small-scale temperature power, we generally expect
T2
S(^n)'a1jrTL(^n)j2+a0; (8)
where we have the following contributions:
1. A term containing the lensing contribution which
scales with the amplitude of the large-scale CMB
temperature gradient jrTL(^n)j2, and
2. a term containing all remaining contributions which
do not scale with the CMB temperature gradient.
Eq. (8) motivates a simple, map-space approach to gather
local statistics for T2
S(^n) andjrTL(^n)j2and to take ad-
vantage of their correlations to bring out the lensing sig-
nal. The expectation is that a1!0 in a CMB tem-
perature map without lensing, and a1should increase
with a stronger lensing signal (i.e., a1/C
L, c.f., 7.).
Contributions to the temperature map such as noise and
foregrounds that do not come from lensing should di-
rectly contribute to a0, but nota1because they are not
expected to correlate with the large-scale CMB temper-
ature gradient. We should therefore be able to infer the
small-scale lensing power from the measured value of a1.A. Map reduction to local patches
Of the two observable quantities in Eq. (8), we begin
with measuring background temperature gradient rTL
as well as the small-scale temperature TSfrom a single
input CMB temperature map. Local statistics of jrTLj2
andT2
Sthen need to be gathered in small cutouts of the
observed eld.
To ensure that we are only including the smooth com-
ponent of the temperature gradient, we lter the maps in
Fourier space. We compute maps of the observed CMB
temperature gradient using
rTL(`) =i`T(`): (9)
We apply a low-pass top hat lter before returning the
map to pixel space: rTL(`>`rT) = 0.
It is not immediately obvious what scale `rTshould be
used in the low-pass lter. Enough modes should be in-
cluded such that the resulting rTLmaps contain enough
information about the background temperature gradient,
and`rTshould be small enough such that there are no
direct correlations from similar shared modes between
rTLand the small scale temperature T(`2000). The
large-scale CMB temperature gradient rTLjthat we are
looking for is mostly constituted by modes `.2000, so
we consider a low-pass cuto at `rT= 3000. It is impor-
tant to keep in mind that pixels near the boundary of the
rTLmap may be unusable if the original Tmap does
not have the appropriate repeating boundary conditions.
In order to pick out only the small scale lensing power
contributions which we wish to correlate with the back-
ground temperature gradient, the original CMB temper-
ature map also needs to be ltered, this time with a high-
pass window ( `min<`<` max) for the scales relevant to
the analysis. A variety of choices for `minand`maxcan
be made as long as scales are in a regime where lensing
is dominant ( `2000), and we require `min> `rTto
ensure that any correlations between the large-scale gra-
dient and small-scale power elds is strictly from lensing.
The choice in `minand`maxaect the expected a1and
a0in Eq. (8) through the angular integral for the total
CMB temperature power.
We then split both ltered maps into patches in order
to estimate the quantities jrTLj2andT2
Salong dierent
lines of sight ^n. The required patch size is also not ob-
vious, but needs to be small such that the assumption of
jrTLj2being constant within a patch is reasonable. In
considering the characteristic angular scale 2=`for
`= 2000, the patches should be .100wide. The patches
also need to be large enough such that there are sucient
pixels of the map within each patch to make good esti-
mates ofjrTLj2andT2
S. This is also dependent on the
resolution of the original map, which will be discussed
further in §V. For the example shown here, we choose
a patch size of 100100, which is 2020 pixels in our
simulated maps with resolution 0 :50.5
FIG. 2. Schematic of a procedure to reduce a CMB tem-
perature map to local, real-space statistics which can then
be correlated to infer lensing eects. Maps in the original
resolution are denoted in green borders, and the light brown
borders indicate a degraded resolution after computing rele-
vant statistics within local patches of width 400. Note that
the patches shown here are for visual presentation, and they
are larger than those chosen later on.
The quantityjrTL(^n)j2can now be computed for ev-
ery patch across the map. For each of the two perpendic-
ular directions on the map ^ xand ^y, we rst compute the
average gradient across each patch rTL(^n) =rxTL^x+
ryTL^y. We can then readily compute jrTL(^n)j2=
(rxTL)2+ (ryTL)2for each patch.B. Lensing from patch statistics
The remaining quantity to compute within each patch
isT2
S(^n). We compute the auto-variance of the high-
pass ltered TSmap within each patch. The jrTLj2
andT2
Sfrom each patch, in principle, provides a very
noisy and approximate estimate of the overall small-scale
lensing power present in the map, following a distribution
about Eq. (8). By combining the statistics of many noisy
patches across the map, there is opportunity to more
rigorously quantify the slope in Eq. (8), and relate it
to the 2D-angular integral of Eq. (5) in the appropriate
space of chosen `rT,`min, and`max.
The outputs of this real-space procedure applied to
both a lensed and unlensed realization of the CMB tem-
perature are shown in Figure 3 to illustrate the rela-
tionship between them. A positive correlation between
T2
SandjrTLj2can be clearly seen in the ensemble of
lensed patches, while no signicant correlation is seen in
the sample of unlensed patches. Two example patches
are also highlighted in Figure 3, and the corresponding
cutouts of the lensed CMB temperature ltered to the rel-
evant scales of the small-scale temperature and the large-
scale gradient are shown. The cutouts show that, even
upon visual inspection, typical areas on the lensed CMB
with a steep background temperature gradient usually
have a higher small scale temperature power than typi-
cal areas with a relatively weak background temperature
gradient.
There are several challenges that must be overcome in
order to use this real-space method as a reliable estima-
tor of CMB lensing. First, it is important to note that
the strictly positive nature of the auto-variance forces the
observed distribution of T2
S(^n) across the map to be posi-
tively skewed. It is also non-trivial to determine a choice
in patch size that optimally includes as many pixels per
patch while keeping the large-scale gradient and lensing
statistics consistent within each patch. In fact, we show
in Section IV and Figure 5 that there is no single patch
size which can be chosen to eectively capture all the
correlations between the large and small scale tempera-
ture uctuations. These factors, combined with the fact
that the temperatures observed in neighboring real-space
pixels across each patch are highly correlated, suggests
that the expected distribution of observed T2
S(^n) about
Eq. (8) is non-trivial. One option to make this distribu-
tion better behaved is to compute the covariance of two
observations of the same CMB temperature eld. By
splitting up time-ordered CMB observations into two or
more maps of the same area of sky, one can take advan-
tage of the fact that the maps contain the same CMB
realization (which should contain the same lensing infor-
mation and correlations) and dierent noise realizations
(which should not co-vary across maps).
One more challenge with quantifying this method is
the loss of information coming from the local large-scale6

gradient direction when computing jrTL(^n)j2. One may
choose to construct individual lters for each real-space
patch and its observed gradient direction in order to fo-
cus on the expected lensing signal(s). One such exam-
ple is choosing a lter f`= cos=^r^`in addition
to the high-pass lter for the small-scale temperature.
In practice, this means that the small-scale temperature
patches must each be ltered separately and uniquely
based on the observed gradient direction in each patch
^rTL(^n). This approach once again faces the previous
challenge of the large-scale temperature gradient uctu-
ations not being fully represented within a single patch
size. The non-Hermitian nature of such a lter also intro-
duces edge-eects along the borders of each patch, which
alters information from an already limited set of pixels
within each patch.
While we limit our current presentation of this real-
space procedure to a qualitative analysis, it provides sig-nicant intuition and motivation for the development
of SCALE. Figure 3 demonstrates that the small-scale
CMB temperature uctuations are intricately tied to the
statistics of the underlying lensing eld as well as the
large-scale temperature uctuations of the CMB itself. In
other words, information about the lensing eld naturally
comes out when correlating small-scale CMB tempera-
ture uctuations to large-scale CMB temperature uc-
tuations. While the observed CMB temperature eld is
expected to be contaminated by foregrounds and noise,
we do not expect such contributions to be strongly cor-
related between small and large scales. These properties
of a lack of noise correlation and the direct lensing cor-
relation between the large-scale gradient and small-scale
temperature are central to SCALE. This estimator over-
comes the weaknesses of the real-space method, and we
will show that it provides a quantitative estimate of the
underlying small-scale lensing statistics in the following7
section.
IV. THE SCALE METHOD
The small-scale lensing signal is reected in CMB tem-
perature maps through local correlations between the
small-scale temperature power uctuations and the large-
scale temperature power uctuations across the sky. For
a given map of the observed CMB temperature eld T(`),
we begin by constructing the elds containing the rele-
vant information at small, and large scales. Here, we will
sketch the procedure of forming the optimal direct esti-
mate of the lens-induced correlation between small-scale
gradient power and large-scale gradient power, in a way
that minimizes the variance of the result. The full details
of the derivation are presented in Appendix A.
We begin by constructing large-scale temperature gra-
dient elds for two perpendicular directions on the map,
rTL(`), by applying the top hat lter W(`) combined
with a Wiener lter to the original temperature eld,

Note that a ducial temperature power spectrum CTT
`is
required for the Wiener lter in this step. It is not imper-
ative that the assumed model exactly matches the under-
lying cosmology, as the results are not sensitive to this
choice. The observed CMB temperature power spectrum,

The eld&strictly contains the small-scale tempera-

large-scale temperature power uctuations captured by
the eld. Such correlations are only expected as a result
of lensing on the original CMB temperature eld because
the lters are chosen to have disjoint support in `. As
a result the cross-spectrum between each eld, C&
L, is a
four-point function that estimates the power of the lens-
ing potential C
L. Each mode Lof the cross-spectrum
represents a particular scale over which the elds and
&correlate. This is illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. The 
elds look visually similar between unlensed and lensed
realizations of the CMB, but in the absence of noise, the
&elds show much stronger uctuations in the lensed
realization (unlensed small scale power is suppressed by
diusion damping). Fluctuations in the lensed &eld
visibly correlate with the eld. Further ltering the 
and&elds illustrates the Lmodes probed by the cross-
spectrum, and the lensing-induced correlation between 
and&becomes striking.
Figure 5 also visualizes how the real-space method
from Section III was combining the information from
many modes of L&500 within each patch, and was
including information from modes L.500 when per-
forming the t with many patches.
The introduction of noise (and foregrounds) adds
power to both and&elds, and it can become the
dominant source of power in the &eld. Noise contribu-
tions toand&are not expected to correlate with each
other, meaning the cross-spectrum C&
Lis expected to be
largely insensitive to noise (though noise will contribute
to its variance).
For the SCALE cross-spectrum to be an unbiased es-
timate of the lensing power, it needs to be normalized to
take into account the ltering that was applied, as well
as the expected action of lensing on the elds:

We note that the nature of our eectively four-point cor-
relator is reminiscent of the trispectrum calculations for
N(1)
L[53] which are typically discarded in CMB lensing
power spectrum analyses. This provides a hint that the
non-Gaussian signatures of CMB lensing are being con-
sidered as part of the SCALE signal. We also note that
the SCALE procedure draws parallels with the estima-
tor constructed in Ref. [52], wherein the locally measured
small-scale ( `&3000) temperature power varies across
the sky due to the patchiness of the kinetic Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich eect. The main dierence is that here we cor-
relate the uctuations in power between large and small
scales, whereas the kSZ estimator of Ref. [52] studies the
angular power spectrum of the locally measured small-
scale temperature power.10
V. SIMULATED OBSERVABLES
We test SCALE on simulated CMB maps to determine
the robustness of the method. The input power spec-
tra for the simulated maps (shown in Figure 1) in all of
our analyses were generated with CAMB1[54, 55] and the
parameters listed in Table I. We choose parameters to
approximately match results from the Planck results [4],
as well as accuracy factors suggested by [56]. We gen-
erate all simulated raw CMB maps using the rand map
method from pixell2at a resolution of 0.5'. Simulated
maps are generally 1010and centered at the equator.
These smaller maps are well within the at-sky approxi-
mation and can be quickly simulated in large quantities.
The rand mapmethod imposes repeating boundary con-
ditions in each realization, so the ltering steps do not
generate any edge eects. When gathering power spec-
trum and/or cross-spectrum statistics, we choose bins of
`, Land  Lthat are integer multiples of the fun-
damental mode `fun= 36 for our maps. This is to en-
sure that we gather values at bin widths which are com-
mensurate with both the grids in which the realizations
themselves were generated and in which the correlation
statistics are evaluated. We apply lensing to the raw
CMB maps using pixell 'slensing package, and a lens
potential eld corresponding to the C
Lspectrum shown
in Figure 1.
For every CMB map, we generate noise realizations
with experiment-relevant values listed in Table II. Con-
guration A represents a Stage III-like survey like ACT
and SPT, while Conguration B is illustrative of the Si-
mons Observatory [SO, 47]. Conguration C gives noise
and beam corresponding to CMB Stage IV-like proper-
ties [46], and Conguration D shows a slightly more fu-
turistic experiment corresponding with some tests made
for the gradient inversion estimator in [16]. Congura-
tion E represents a low-noise, high-resolution experiment
like the proposed CMB-HD [50]. We also briey consider
tests in the noise-free limit.
We consider a range of current to future experiments,
and we present a particular focus of results for Cong-
uration D. We generally choose a window function for
W&(`) to include modes `12[6000;8000] (unless oth-
erwise shown) for a balance between being in a regime
where the lensing signal is expected to be high, and noise
is not too dominant (refer to Figure 1). This reasoning
is demonstrated against several choices of `1windows in
Sec. VI, but we expect the SCALE methodology to be
eective as long as `1satises our small-scale approx-
imations (i.e., `12000). We also generally choose
W(`) to include modes `22[0;3000] to ensure that 
maps include most of the information about the large-
scale temperature gradient power.

We later compare the results of our SCALE lensing
method to those of the Hu, DeDeo & Vale [HDV, 51]
quadratic estimator with the TTelds. We choose to
compare with a quadratic estimator since it provides well-
understood and established benchmark. We choose the
HDV quadratic estimator in particular due to its be-
havior in the small-scale regime. Small angular scale
(`&2000) contributions to the gradient power are re-
moved in the HDV implementation to avoid a bias intro-
duced by higher order cross-terms between the tempera-
ture gradient and the lensing convergence in this regime;
this is less of a concern with the original Hu & Okamoto
estimators applied at larger angular scales (refer to Fig-
ure 1 and [51]). The HDV quadratic estimator and its
principles have also been applied in studies of cluster
lensing including some using Planck [57], SPT data [58],
ACT data [59], as well as forecasts of lensing results with
the proposed CMB-HD experiment [60]. We perform
reconstructions of the lensing convergence eld ^ with
the HDV method for a subset of simulated lensed CMB
maps, along with computations of the optimal noise N(0)

eld of the TTquadratic estimator, and the nal mask
is applied to the reconstructed convergence eld. We ap-
ply our method to 100 000 realizations for each suite of
tests to obtain stable statistics of the SCALE output. In
particular, we found that we need at least 100 000 simula-
tions to reach a converged inverse covariance matrix that
we use later to compute signal-to-noise. We apply the
HDV quadratic estimator on a subset containing 10 000
of the full set of realizations when making comparisons,
choosing a smaller sample size because it is computation-
ally more intensive to run quadratic estimators. We also
found that the inverse covariance matrix for the HDV
output converges with a sample size of 10 000. Each set
of simulations applying the SCALE procedure shares the

VI. RESULTS
The SCALE estimator is exceptional at detecting the
presence of small-scale lensing in CMB temperature
maps. We illustrate this in Figure 7, which shows the
summary statistics of recovered ^	Lfrom 100 000 simula-
tions of 1010lensed and unlensed CMB temperature
maps in the experiment D noise conguration. The com-
bination of all bins in Figure 7 corresponds to a detection
of lensing in 100 sq.deg. maps over the null test with
an approximate SNR of 9. We also show the expected
theoreticalh	Licomputed with Eq. (18). The vertical
extent of the error bars represents the 68% width of the
distribution (centered at the median within the Lbin) of
estimated ^	Lband-powers, and they describe the statis-
tical scatter of estimated band-powers for a given CMB

imations are appropriate. Figure 8 shows comparisons
between expected h	Licomputed with Eq. (18) and
Eq. (19) and recovered ^	Lband-power statistics from
simulations for dierent shifts in the small-scale `1win-
dow while keeping  `1= 2000. This roughly corresponds
to shifting (in the same direction) which CTT
`,NTT
`and
C
Lmodes contribute to 	 L. The expected and recov-
ered band-powers agree to the same extent as the results
from Figure 7. The recovered band-powers begin to ex-
hibit a positive bias as the `1window is shifted towards
lower`, which can be explained by a departure from the
small-scale lensing approximations made in Section II. In
particular, the Taylor series expansion in Eq. (1) becomes
inaccurate at scales `2000 because of the similarity
of scales with the average deection angle [1]. Higher
accuracy in this regime would require consideration of
higher-order terms of the expansion. The overall ampli-
tude of each 	 Lcurve decreases as the `1window shifts
to higher`, which reects the shape of the C
Llensing
power spectrum in Figure 1. The statistical spread of
	Lband-powers grows as the `1window is shifted to
higher`because of increased contributions from exper-
iment noise NTT
`at high`(see Figure 1). The default
6000< `1<8000 window presented in Figure 7 oers
a balance between satisfying the small-scale lensing ap-
proximations while not appearing to be statistically dom-
inated by experiment noise.
Mathematically, Eq. (17) and Eq. (18) are constructed
such that the SCALE output is a normalized estimate
of the average lensing power within and slightly around
the small-scale `1window. The `1window width de-13
termines how many C
Lmodes contribute to what we
consider signal, but the amplitude of 	 Lcentered at the
same`1should not change signicantly after normaliza-
tion withAL. Similarly, we add more contributions from
NTT
`modes, but they are not expected to strongly cor-
relate between large/small-scales. The overall eect of
widening the `1window is to use the increased presence
of lensing signal to reduce statistical scatter of recov-
ered 	 Lband-powers. Figure 9 illustrates this quite well
by comparing 	 Lafter narrowing or widening  `1while
keeping the window centered at `1= 7000. The overall
amplitude of the normalized 	 Lcurves appears mostly
unchanged, and a wider window does indeed result in
tighter distributions of recovered 	 Lband-powers. The
changes we do see in the amplitude of 	 Lare set by the
shape of the underlying lensing power spectrum (i.e., the
slope ofC
Lis slightly steeper on one side of the bin
center when compared to the other).
While the goal of conventional methods is to recon-
struct the underlying lensing eld, the SCALE method's
output 	 Lis an indirect estimate of the statistics of the
lensing eld. Figure 5 illustrates the space of Lmodes
in which the small-scale temperature power uctuations
correlate with those on the large-scales. These Lmodes
arenot equivalent to the space of Lmodes describing
the lensing eld itself. As shown in Eq. (18), each band-
power of 	 Lcontains information from a wide range of
lensing eld statistic modes C

compare them in Figure 11 as well as Table IV. We scale

The reverse is also true: lensing modes within 6000 <
L < 8000 would also contribute to a lesser extent in
other implementations of SCALE with a dierent choice

of the SCALE signal if we choose instead to lter for

VII. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION
In this paper, we:
•showed that uctuations in the local small-scale
(`3000) CMB temperature power are intricately
tied to the variations in the local large-scale tem-15
perature gradient through correlations induced by
lensing.
•conrmed that this correlation is readily detectable
in the pixel-space statistics of a lensed CMB tem-
perature map, and there is no discernable correla-
tion in a CMB temperature map without lensing
(see Figure 3).
•visualized correlations between a cross spectrum of
large/small-scale CMB temperature power in Fig-
ure 5.
•created the Small Correlated Against Large Esti-
mator (SCALE) which eciently applies various l-
ters to pick out the relevant small/large-scale in a
CMB temperature map, and computes their cross
spectrum (Figure 6).
•demonstrated that the SCALE method eectively
recovers the expected statistics of underlying lens-
ing elds, which matches well with insignicant
bias against analytic forms (Figure 7).
•tested the properties of the SCALE estimator
against dierent choices of ltering scales (Fig-
ures 8-9).
•determined that the SCALE method can outper-
form (by a factor of up to 1.5 in signal-to-noise)
estimates of the CMB lensing power spectrum C
L
through reconstruction with quadratic estimators
in noise congurations similar to future experi-
ments.
We nd that signicant lensing signals at modes L >
3000 can be recovered by exploiting the dependence
of the CMB temperature power at similar scales ` >
3000 on uctuations of the CMB temperature gradient
(Eq. (1), illustrated by Figure 5). A key advantage of this
method is the expectation that any noise, foregrounds,
and other CMB secondaries present in observations of
the CMB temperature are not expected to correlate with
the CMB gradient uctuations themselves. Foregrounds
in particular are known to be a nuisance at all angu-
lar scales (e.g., [61, 62]), but there have been signicant
advancements in foreground cleaning techniques in tan-
dem with multi-frequency observations from space exper-
iments such as Planck . We expect foregrounds to be well
controlled at angular scales relevant to the construction
of the large-scale maps [63{66]. We expect the eects of
foregrounds and foreground cleaning to change the noise
structure in the small-scale &maps, but these contribu-
tions should not correlate with if the foregrounds have
been cleaned properly at large angular scales. At these
small scales, telescope systematic eects such as the dif-
ferential and boresight pointing become more important
and need to be modeled correctly to remain below a level
of 1[67].
We rst demonstrated the correlation between
large/small-scales in the CMB temperature eld withreal-space statistics to detect the presence of lensing in
a small temperature map covering 100 square degrees.
The SCALE procedure builds on the intuitions of the
real-space method from Section III, and it can success-
fully quantify the correlations induced by lensing in line
with expectations.
A simple comparison of signal-to-noise for congura-
tions similar to present and future experiments reveals
that the SCALE method demonstrates a marked im-
provement over the eectiveness of traditional quadratic
estimators at low noise levels in the small-scale regime.
We do not expect that SCALE will serve as a replacement
for existing lensing reconstruction techniques. Map-
level reconstruction is useful for delensing and cross-
correlation studies, and there are existing reconstruction
techniques that are optimal across a wide range of angu-
lar scales. SCALE provides the most benet in the small-
scale and low noise lensing regime, so the most precise
lensing measurements are likely to come from a combi-
nation of dierent techniques applied to dierent scales.
This could be achieved, for example, by utilizing an esti-
mate of the lensing map from a quadratic estimator, us-
ing the estimated lensing map to delens the CMB temper-
ature, and then applying SCALE to estimate the power
spectrum of the low noise, small-scale lensing modes that
remain in the delensed map. We wish to highlight the
simplicity of the SCALE pipeline's steps, which allows
it to be quickly applied to any given CMB temperature
map. This is in contrast to the maximum likelihood and
maximum a posteriori methods which have been shown
to be optimal, but they are computationally expensive
to perform. These methods, in addition to the Bayesian
and Gradient Inversion methods, reconstruct the under-
lying lensing eld , which can then be cross-analyzed
with other observations such as galaxy clusters. SCALE
does not reconstruct a map of the lensing eld, but it
is a simple and fast method of eectively recovering the
statistics of the underlying lensing eld to levels of ac-
curacy and precision beyond what is capable with QE
techniques.
The SCALE method presents an optimistic outlook
for the future of CMB lensing science, providing a fresh
opportunity to make high-quality estimates of lensing
statistics using a relatively straightforward procedure in
a regime that has historically been limited in CMB-only
techniques due to limits in techniques and observational
noise. The small-scale regime is particularly exciting be-
cause the lensing statistics here are sensitive to a wide-
range of dark matter and gravitational clustering phe-
nomena.

Appendix A: Derivation of SCALE
We wish to construct an estimator of the small scale lensing power. We will construct the estimator using the cross
correlation between a eld constructed from the square of small-scale temperature uctuations and a eld constructed
from the square of large-scale temperature uctuations. In the very small-scale regime, where the eects of lensing
dominate the temperature power spectrum, the temperature power is proportional to the product of the large-scale
temperature gradient power and the small-scale lensing deection power. The motivation of the estimator that we
construct here is that the small-scale lensing-induced temperature power is non-Gaussian; the locally measured small-
scale temperature power is correlated with variations in the large-scale temperature gradient, and the relation between
the two is proportional to the small-scale lensing power.
Let us rst dene a eld &dened by the locally measured small-scale temperature gradient power
