Abstract
This paper is concerned with paired operators in the context of the
Lebesgue Hilbert space on the unit circle and its subspace, the Hard y
space. By considering when such operators commute, generalizat ions
of the Brown–Halmos results for Toeplitz operators are derived. F ur-
ther, the kernels of such operators are described, giving results on in-
variant and nearly-invariant subspaces, together with a generaliz ation
of Coburn’s theorem on Toeplitz kernels.
Keywords: paired operator; paired kernel; Toeplitz operator; invari ant

1 Introduction
LetXbea Hilbert space and P,Qcomplementary orthogonal projections on
X. ForA,Bbounded linear operators on Xwe deﬁne the paired operators
SA,B=AP+BQand ΣA,B=PA+QB(see [15]). These ﬁrst appeared in
the context of singular integral equations, and have been th e object of re-
newed interest because of the recently-established connec tion with problems
in diﬀraction theory [17], dual truncated Toepliz operators [4], and the char-
acterization of block Toeplitz operators whose kernels pre sent a scalar-type
structure [7, Cor. 3.4].

1Here we work in the particular context of L2(T), where Tis the unit
circle, andPisP+, the orthogonal projection onto the Hardy space H2of
the unit disc and QisP−, the complementary projection onto ( H2)⊥=H2
0.
The operators AandBare multiplication operators A=MaandB=Mb
witha,b∈L∞(T). This is the most common setting where these operators
are studied, and also that with the most applications. They h ave been
studied usually under an extra condition that either aorbis invertible in
L∞(T) or, at most, has zeros of “integer order” at a ﬁnite set of poi nts ofT
(see [15, Sec. VI.8] for a more precise deﬁnition).
Paired operators are also closely connected with Toeplitz o perators: in
fact, they are dilations of Toeplitz operators. Moreover, i t can be shown
that ifb±1∈L∞(T), then the paired operator aP++bP−onL2(T) is
equivalent after extension (as deﬁned in [1]) to the Toeplit z operator Ta/b
onH2(see [3]), and an analogous result can be obtained for dual To eplitz
operators if a±1∈L∞(T). Thus it is natural to ask whether various well
known properties of Toeplitz operators have analogues for p aired operators.
Inthispaperweexplorenewconnectionsofpairedoperators withToeplitz
andHankel operators. Westudytheiralgebraic properties, suchaswhentwo
such operators commute, providing a generalization of the B rown–Halmos
results for Toeplitz operators. Then we consider the kernel s of paired oper-
ators: this theme leads oﬀ in two directions, one of which con cerns invariant
and nearly-invariant subspaces, while in the other directi on we arrive at a
generalization of Coburn’s theorem on Toeplitz kernels.
2 Paired operators: basic properties
From now on we write Lpto denoteLp(T) forp= 2 andp=∞.
Leta,b∈L∞. Thepaired operator Sa,b:L2→L2is deﬁned by
Sa,bf=aP+f+bP−f,(f∈L2). (2.1)
We call Σ a,b:L2→L2, deﬁned by
Σa,bf=P+af+P−bf,(f∈L2), (2.2)
atransposed paired operator . We say that Sa,band Σ a,baredualto each
other, while Sa,band Σb,aare said to be transposed to each other (see [15]).
Deﬁnition 2.1. We say that a pair {a,b}isnondegenerate ifa,b∈L∞are
nonzero a.e. on T, anda−bis too.
2Nondegeneracy willbeacommonhypothesisinourwork, altho ughsome-
times the weaker condition that a−b/\e}atio\slash= 0 will be suﬃcient.
Note that we identify awithMa, the operator of multiplication by a
whenever the context is clear. In particular, we write P+a+P−binstead of
P+aI+P−bI.
Using the orthogonal decomposition L2=H2⊕H2
0we may write down
the matrix representation of Sa,b. For convenience, write P±a=a±and
similarly for b. Now since for h+∈H2we haveSa,bh+=ah+, the matrix
form ofSa,bis a matrix of Hankel and Toeplitz operators:
Sa,b=/parenleftbigga++P+a−P+b+
P−a−P−b++b−/parenrightbigg
:H2⊕H2
0→H2⊕H2
0.
Note that initially this matrix is only densely deﬁned, but s ince it corre-
sponds to a bounded operator it can be extended to the whole of L2.
These various operators are related as follows.
Proposition 2.2. (i)S∗
a,b= Σ¯a,¯b, and
(ii)Sa,bf=zS¯b,¯a¯z¯f=zΣ∗
b,a¯z¯ffor allf∈L2.
Proof.(i) is clear; (ii) follows from the relations P±f=zP∓¯z¯f.
Proposition 2.3. LetM= max(/bardbla/bardbl∞,/bardblb/bardbl∞). Then
M≤ /bardblSa,b/bardbl ≤min(√
2M,/bardbla/bardbl∞+/bardblb/bardbl∞). (2.3)
Proof.Restricting to f∈H2, we haveSa,bf=afand so/bardblSa,b/bardbl ≥ /bardblTa/bardbl=
/bardbla/bardbl∞, whereTais the usual Toeplitz operator deﬁned by Taf=P+af.
Analogously, /bardblSa,b/bardbl ≥ /bardblb/bardbl∞and so/bardblSa,b/bardbl ≥M.
Next,/bardblSa,b/bardbl ≤ /bardbla/bardbl∞+/bardblb/bardbl∞is clear. Finally, from
/bardblφ/bardbl2
2=/bardblP+φ/bardbl2
2+/bardblP−φ/bardbl2
2,(φ∈L2),
we know that for each such φthere is aθ∈[0,π/2] such that /bardblP+φ/bardbl2=
/bardblφ/bardbl2cosθand/bardblP−φ/bardbl2=/bardblφ/bardbl2sinθ.
Thus
/bardblSa,bφ/bardbl2=/bardblaP+φ+bP−φ/bardbl2
≤(/bardbla/bardbl∞cosθ+/bardblb/bardbl∞sinθ)/bardblφ/bardbl2
≤max{/bardbla/bardbl∞,/bardblb/bardbl∞}(cosθ+sinθ)/bardblφ/bardbl2≤M√
2/bardblφ/bardbl2.
So we also have
/bardblSa,b/bardbl ≤√
2M, (2.4)
and the second inequality in (2.3) follows.
3As a consequence, we can characterise the zero paired operat or:
Corollary 2.4. Sa,b= 0if and only if a=b= 0inL∞.
Remark 2.5. The estimates obtained in Proposition 2.3 are optimal. We
have nontrivial cases where /bardblSa,b/bardbl=M, e.g., ifa=b= 1, and cases
where/bardblSa,b/bardbl=√
2M, e.g. ifa= 1 andb=z. In the latter case, taking
φ(z) = 1+1
z, we haveSa,bφ= 2 and /bardblφ/bardbl=√
2, so/bardblSa,b/bardbl ≥√
2, and, from
(2.4),/bardblSa,b/bardbl=√
2 =√
2M.
Proposition 2.6. /bardblSa,b/bardbl=/bardbla/bardbl∞+/bardblb/bardbl∞if and only if either aorbis0
a.e.
Proof.First ifb= 0 thenSa,bφ=aP+φand since /bardblSa,0/bardbl ≥ /bardblTa/bardbl=/bardbla/bardbl∞
(whereTais the Toeplitz operator) it is clear that /bardblSa,0/bardbl=/bardbla/bardbl∞too. Sim-
ilarly ifa= 0.
For the converse, suppose that there is a φ∈L2with/bardblφ/bardbl2= 1 and for
someǫwith 0<ǫ<1 we have
/bardblaP+φ+bP−φ/bardbl ≥(1−ǫ)(/bardbla/bardbl∞+/bardblb/bardbl∞).
For what we are trying to prove we may assume that aandbare both
nonzero. There is a θ∈[0,π/2] such that /bardblP+φ/bardbl2= cosθand/bardblP−φ/bardbl2=
sinθ. Thus, with A=/bardbla/bardbl∞andB=/bardblb/bardbl∞we have
Acosθ+Bsinθ≥(1−ǫ)(A+B),
and hence by Cauchy–Schwarz
A2+B2≥(1−ǫ)2(A2+2AB+B2)
or (2ǫ−ǫ2)(A2+B2)≥2(1−ǫ)2AB. Now suppose that A≥B(the other
way round is similar). Then we have
2(2ǫ−ǫ2)A2≥2(1−ǫ)2AB
and soB≤(2ǫ−ǫ2)A/(1−ǫ)2, and since we can take ǫ>0 arbitrary, this
means that B= 0.
43 Brown–Halmos type theorems
Paired operators are closely related to Toeplitz operators in various ways.
For instance, Toeplitz operators Ta, witha∈L∞, can be seen as compres-
sions toH2of paired operators of the form Sa,b=aP++bP−or their
duals Σ a,b=P+a+P−b, withb∈L∞. Given that, by the Brown–Halmos
theorems [2] we have for a,˜a∈L∞that
TaT˜a=Ta˜a⇐⇒a∈H∞or ˜a∈H∞,
one may ask, similarly, when the composition of two paired op erators is a
paired operator or, more precisely, when the equations
(aP++bP−)(˜aP++˜bP−) =a˜aP++b˜bP−(3.1)
(P+a+P−b)(P+˜a+P−˜b) =P+(a˜a)+P−(b˜b) (3.2)
hold. It is clear that (3.1) and (3.2) hold if a=band ˜a=˜brespectively.
Otherwise we have the following (recall that nondegeneracy was deﬁned in
Deﬁnition 2.1).
Proposition 3.1. Leta,˜a,b,˜b∈L∞and suppose that {a,b}and{˜a,˜b}are
nondegenerate. Then
Sa,bS˜a,˜b=Sa˜a,b˜b⇐⇒˜a∈H∞and˜b∈H∞ (3.3)
Σa,bΣ˜a,˜b= Σa˜a,b˜b⇐⇒a∈H∞andb∈H∞. (3.4)
Proof.We have that
(aP++bP−)(˜aP++˜bP−) =a˜aP++b˜bP−+T,
where
T=−aP−˜aP++aP+˜bP−+bP−˜aP+−bP+˜bP−
= (a−b)(P+˜bP−−P−˜aP+).
If ˜a∈H∞and˜b∈H∞thenT= 0. Conversely, suppose that T= 0. Then,
for allf∈L2we haveP+˜bP−f=P−˜aP+f= 0 and therefore, taking f= 1,
we haveP−˜a= 0, i.e., ˜a∈H2∩L∞=H∞. Similarly, taking f= ¯z, we
haveP+˜b¯z= 0, i.e., ˜b¯z∈H2
0∩¯zL∞= ¯zH∞.
The equivalence in (3.4) is proved similarly, or by taking ad joints.
It follows from Proposition 3.1 that Sa,bS˜a,˜b=S˜a,˜bSa,bwhena,˜a∈H∞
andb,˜b∈H∞, and that Σ a,bΣ˜a,˜b= Σ˜a,˜bΣa,bwhenevera,˜a∈H∞and
b,˜b∈H∞. More generally, we have the following.
5Proposition 3.2. Leta,˜a,b,˜b∈L∞with{a,b},{˜a,˜b}nondegenerate. Then
Sa,bS˜a,˜b=S˜a,˜bSa,b⇐⇒(a−b)(P−˜aP+−P+˜bP−) = (˜a−˜b)(P−aP+−P+bP−).
Proof.
Sa,bS˜a,˜b−S˜a,˜bSa,b
=−aP−˜aP++aP+˜bP−+bP−˜aP+−bP+˜bP−
+ ˜aP−aP+−˜aP+bP−−˜bP−aP++˜bP+bP−
=−(a−b)(P−˜aP+−P+˜bP−)−(˜a−˜b)(P+bP−−P−aP+).
Corollary 3.3. Forη∈L∞and{a,b}nondegenerate,
ηSa,b=Sa,bη⇐⇒η∈C.
Proof.ηI=Sη,η, and applying the calculation in the proof of Proposition
3.2 we have
ηSa,b=Sa,bη⇐⇒P−ηP+=P+ηP−,
which is true if and only if η∈C.
One may then ask for which functions f∈L2do multiplication by ηand
Sa,bcommute.
Proposition 3.4. Forη∈L∞,{a,b}nondegenerate, and f∈L2,
ηSa,bf=Sa,b(ηf)⇐⇒f∈kerHη⊕ker˜Hη
⇐⇒ηf+∈H2,ηf−∈H2
0
⇐⇒ηf+=P+(ηf)
⇐⇒ηf−=P−(ηf),
where the Hankel operators Hηand˜Hηare deﬁned by Hη=P−ηP+and
˜Hη=P+ηP−, and we write f±=P±f.
Proof.From Proposition 3.2 we have
ηSa,bf=Sa,b(ηf)⇐⇒P−ηf+=P+ηf−,
whichhappensifandonlyif P−ηf+=P+ηf−= 0, orequivalently ηf+∈H2
andηf−∈H2
0.
6NowP+(ηf) =P+(ηf+)+P+(ηf−); ifηf+∈H2andηf−∈H2
0, then
we haveP+(ηf) =ηf+.
Conversely, if ηf+=P+(ηf) thenηf+∈H2; on the other hand, ηf+=
P+(ηf) =P+(ηf+)+P+(ηf−) =ηf++P+(ηf−), soP+(ηf−) = 0 and we
conclude that ηf−∈H2
0.
The last equivalence is proved analogously.
At this point we require the theory of inner and outer functio ns, and the
inner–outer factorization in H2. A suitable reference is [16, Chap. 1].
As an example of a class of functions η∈L∞andf∈L2such that
P±(ηf) =ηP±fwe have the following, where θdenotes an inner function
andKθis its associated model space Kθ=H2⊖θH2.
Proposition 3.5. Ifη∈H∞is such that η=α¯θhwithh∈H∞andαan
inner function, then for all f∈K⊥
θwe haveP±(ηf) =ηP±f.
Proof.Sincef∈K⊥
θcan be written in the form f=f−+θf+withf−∈H2
0
andf+∈H2, we have that
ηf=η(f−+θf+) =ηf−+α¯θhθf+=ηf−+αhf+,
whereηf−∈H2
0andαhf+∈H2. Therefore P+(ηf) =αhf+=ηθf+=
ηP+fandP−(ηf) =ηf−=ηP−f.
Remark 3.6. We have that w∈L∞is a multiplier from a model space
Kθ1onto another model space Kθ2, i.e.,wKθ1=Kθ2, if and only if w∈
Hol(D)withw=γθ2θ1¯wwhere|γ|= 1(see [9] and [6]). Thus conjugates of
the surjective multipliers between two model spaces provid e examples of the
functionsηdescribed in Proposition 3.5.
4 Paired kernels
We denote the kernel of a paired operator, which we call a paired kernel , by
kera,b= kerSa,b. (4.1)
Paired kernels are closely connected with Toeplitz kernels . To obtain this
relation, we start by recalling that two operators TandS, on the Banach
spacesXandYrespectively, are said to be equivalent if and only if there
exist invertible operators EandFsuch thatT=ESF. Clearly, in this case
we have the isomorphism ker T≃kerSsince we have ker T=F−1kerS.
7The operators TandSare said to be equivalent after extension if and only
if there are Banach spaces ˜Xand˜Ysuch that the operators
˜T=/bracketleftbiggT0
0I˜X/bracketrightbigg
and ˜S=/bracketleftbiggS0
0I˜Y/bracketrightbigg
are equivalent (see [1]).
Ifb∈ GL∞(that is, if it is invertible in L∞), then it is clear that Sa,b
is equivalent to SG,1, whereG=a/b. On the other hand, letting again TG
denote the Toeplitz operator with symbol G∈L∞,
TG:H2→H2, T G=P+GP+
|H2, (4.2)
we have that TGis equivalent after extension to the paired operator SG,1
(see [3]). This means in particular that the kernels of the tw o operators are
isomorphic,
kerTG≃kerSG,1= kerG,1, (4.3)
the isomorphism in this case being induced by the mapping P+, and we
have
kerTG=P+kerG,1=: ker+
G,1. (4.4)
More generally, we denote
ker±
a,b=P±kera,b=P±kerSa,b. (4.5)
As happens with Toeplitz kernels, paired kernels and their p rojections
(4.5) possess many interesting properties which, in the cas e of ker±
a,b, gener-
alize those of Toeplitz kernels.
It is well known that, for a∈L∞\{0}we have ker Ta={0}ifa∈H∞
and kerTa/\e}atio\slash={0}ifa∈H2
0. A corresponding result for paired kernels is the
following.
Proposition 4.1. Leta,b∈L∞\{0}. Then:
(i)kera,b={0}ifa∈H∞andb∈H∞;
(ii)kera,b/\e}atio\slash={0}ifa∈H∞andb∈H∞has a nontrivial inner factor;
(iii)kera,b/\e}atio\slash={0}ifa∈H∞
0andb∈H∞.
8Proof.(i)aP+f+bP−f= 0⇐⇒aP+f=−bP−fand, since the left-hand
side of this equation is in H2while the right-hand side is in H2
0, both are
zero and it follows that P±f= 0, sof= 0.
(ii) Letb=bibobe the inner-outer factorization of b. Then we have
af++bf−= 0 forf+=bi−bi(0)
zboandf−=−a1−bi(0)bi
z.
(iii) Clearly, taking f+=bandf−=−agives a function f=f++f−
in kera,b. Alternatively, the result follows from part (ii), since ke ra,b=
kerza,zb.
We may see (iii) as a generalization of the property that ker Ta/\e}atio\slash={0}if
a∈H∞
0, as follows:
Ifa∈H∞
0, then saying that φ+∈kerTais equivalent to saying that
there is aφ−∈H2
0such thataφ+=φ−. That is,aφ++bφ−= 0, where
a∈H2
0andb=−1∈H∞.
We now use the notation
φ±=P±φ,(φ∈L2). (4.6)
Remark 4.2. Note that, with the assumption that {a,b}is nondegenerate,
ifφ∈kera,band eitherφ+= 0orφ−= 0on a set of positive measure then,
by the Luzin–Privalov theorem, we must have φ= 0.
Clearly, for any measurable complex-valued function ηdeﬁned a.e. on T
such thatη/\e}atio\slash= 0 a.e. on T, we have the implication
˜a=ηa,˜b=ηb=⇒kera,b= ker˜a,˜b. (4.7)
It is thus natural to ask when two paired kernels are equal or r elated by
inclusion, and whether the converse of (4.7) holds.
Proposition 4.3. For a nondegenerate pair {a,b}ifkera,b/\e}atio\slash={0}, then, for
any˜a,˜b∈L∞, it holds that
kera,b= ker˜a,˜b⇐⇒a˜b= ˜ab.
Proof.Suppose that ker a,b/\e}atio\slash={0}and ker a,b= ker˜a,˜b. Then, for every φ∈
kera,bwithφ/\e}atio\slash= 0, we have
aφ++bφ−= ˜aφ++˜bφ−= 0, (4.8)
which implies that ( a˜b−˜ab)φ+φ−= 0.
9Ifa˜b−˜ab/\e}atio\slash= 0 on a set of positive measure, then φ+orφ−must vanish
on a set of positive measure, and by Remark 4.2 we have φ= 0, which is a
contradiction. We conclude then that a˜b−˜ab= 0.
Conversely, suppose that a˜b= ˜ab. Takingη= ˜a/a=˜b/bwe have
kera,b= ker˜a,˜bby (4.7).
This shows that the converse of (4.7) holds. We also have the f ollowing.
Corollary 4.4. Each nonzero kera,bwith{a,b}nondegenerate is uniquely
determined by any of its nonzero elements and
kera,b∩ker˜a,˜b/\e}atio\slash={0} ⇐⇒ kera,b= ker˜a,˜b.
if˜aand˜bare also in L∞.
Corollary 4.5. With the same assumptions as in Proposition 4.3, we have
kera,b⊆ker˜a,˜b⇐⇒/braceleftBig
kera,b= ker˜a,˜b∨kera,b={0}/bracerightBig
.
Thefollowingresultshowsthat, initsturn, eachnonzero φ∈L2uniquely
determines a paired kernel.
Theorem 4.6. For eachφ∈L2\ {0}, there is one and only one paired
kernel to which φbelongs.
Proof.Takeφ=φ++φ−∈L2\{0}and letφ+=I+O+andφ−=I−O−,
whereI+andI−are inner functions and O+and ¯zO−are outer functions
inH2. Then we have
I−O−
I+O+φ+=φ−; that is, I+φ+
O+=I−φ−
O−. (4.9)
Now 1/O+belongs to the Smirnoﬀ class N+, so that there are H1+andH2+
inH∞such that1
O+=H1+
H2+(4.10)
(see, for example, [16]). Analogously,
1
¯zO−=h1+
h2+(4.11)
withh1+,h2+∈H∞. Thus, from (4.9)–(4.11) we have
(I+H1+h2+)φ+−(I−zh1+H2+)φ−= 0
soφ∈kera,bwitha=I+H1+h2+andb=−I−zh1+H2+, which are L∞
functions. By Corollary 4.4, ker a,bis theonly paired kernel containing φ.
105 Invariance and near invariance
Toeplitz kernels are S∗-invariant, where S∗is the backward shift S∗=T¯z,
whenever the associated symbol is in H∞, that is
S∗(kerTφ)⊆kerTφforφ∈H∞. (5.1)
These Toeplitz kernels are the model spaces , and they are the nontrivial
subspaces of H2that are invariant for S∗.
Recall that a subspace M⊆H2is said to be nearlyS∗-invariant if
f∈M, f(0) = 0 = ⇒S∗f∈M. (5.2)
While not all Toeplitz kernels are S∗-invariant subspaces of H2, they are all
nearlyS∗-invariant (see [5] for more on this subject). Note that for f∈H2
we havef(0) = 0 if and only if f∈kerH¯z, whereH¯zis the Hankel operator
H¯z=P−¯zP+
|H2. Thus (5.2) for M= kerTφcan equivalently be written as
f∈kerTφ∩kerH¯z=⇒T¯zf∈kerTφ. (5.3)
This is an important property of Toeplitz kernels which can b e seen as
describing, in the case when ker TGis not invariant for S∗, the part of ker Tφ
that is mapped onto ker TφbyT¯z=S∗.
More generally, Toeplitz kernels are nearly Tη-invariant for every η∈
H∞, i.e.,
f∈kerTφ∩kerHη=⇒Tηf∈kerTφ (5.4)
(see [5, Sec. 3]), and if in addition φ∈H∞, then kerTφis invariant for
Tη. It is natural to ask whether similar invariance properties hold for paired
kernels. We start by recalling that, for two operators AandB,
AB=BA=⇒kerAis invariant for B, (5.5)
since, iff∈kerA, thenA(Bf) =B(Af) = 0 and so Bf∈kerA. From this
and Proposition 3.2 we get the following.
Proposition 5.1. Leta,˜a,b,˜b∈L∞with{a,b},{˜a,˜b}nondegenerate. Then
kerSa,bis invariant for S˜a,˜bifa,˜a∈H∞andb,˜b∈H∞; alsokerΣa,bis
invariant for Σ˜a,˜bifa,˜a∈H∞andb,˜b∈H∞.
Regarding the invariance properties with respect to Sη,η=ηIwe have:
11Proposition 5.2. Forη∈L∞and{a,b}nondegenerate we have that if
f∈kera,bthen we have ηf∈kera,bif and only if
f∈kerHη⊕ker˜Hη, (5.6)
whereHη=P−ηP+|H2and˜Hη=P+ηP−
|H2
0.
Proof.Letf,ηf∈kera,b. Then
0 =aP+ηf+bP−ηf
=aP+ηf++aP+ηf−+bP−ηf++bP−ηf−
=aηf+−aP−ηf++aP+ηf−+bP−ηf++bηf−−bP+ηf−
=−(a−b)(P−ηf+−P+ηf−),
soP−ηf+=P+ηf−= 0, which is equivalent to f∈kerHη⊕ker˜Hη.
The converse follows from the same calculation.
We get an analogue of (5.4) as follows:
Proposition 5.3. Forη∈L∞and{a,b}nondegenerate and f∈L2,
f∈kera,b∩(kerHη⊕ker˜Hη) =⇒Sη,ηf∈kera,b.
6 Coburn’s lemma
Coburn’s lemma for Toeplitz operators [8] asserts that for g∈L∞at least
one of kerTgand kerT∗
gis{0}. To obtain a generalization of this lemma we
study the relations between the kernels of Sa,b,S¯b,¯a, and Σ¯a,¯b=S∗
a,b.
Lemma 6.1. P±(¯z¯φ) = ¯zφ∓.
Proof.Observe that ¯ z¯φ= ¯zφ+/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈H2
0+¯zφ−/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈H2and the result follows.
Lemma 6.2. kera,b=zker¯b,¯a.
Proof.We have
φ∈kera,b⇐⇒aφ++bφ−= 0
⇐⇒¯a¯zφ++¯b¯zφ−= 0
⇐⇒¯bP+(¯z¯φ)+¯aP−(¯z¯φ) = 0
⇐⇒¯z¯φ∈ker¯b,¯a,
where the third equivalence follows from Lemma 6.1.
12We can thus deﬁne an antilinear isomorphism between ker a,band ker ¯b,¯a,
as follows.
Proposition 6.3. The antilinear operator
J: kera,b→ker¯b,¯a, Jφ = ¯z¯φ (6.1)
is well deﬁned and bijective.
Next, we construct an isomorphism from ker∗
a,b:= kerS∗
a,bonto ker¯a,¯b.
Proposition 6.4. For nondegenerate {a,b}the operator ˜J: ker∗
a,b→ker¯a,¯b
deﬁned by
˜Jψ= (¯a−¯b)ψ,(ψ∈ker∗
a,b) (6.2)
is injective, and if
a∈ GL∞,orb∈ GL∞,or(a−b)∈ GL∞, (6.3)
then˜Jis an isomorphism from ker∗
a,bontoker¯a,¯b.
Proof.We begin by showing that the operator is well deﬁned, i.e.,
(¯a−¯b)kerS∗
a,b⊆kerS¯a,¯b. (6.4)
Letψ∈ker∗
a,b= kerS∗
a,b, which means that
P+(¯aψ) =−P−(¯bψ) = 0, (6.5)
sinceH2∩H2
0={0}. Then
S¯a,¯b(¯a−¯b)ψ= ¯aP+(¯aψ)−¯aP+(¯bψ)+¯bP−(¯aψ)−¯bP−(¯bψ)
=−¯aP+(¯bψ)+¯bP−(¯aψ)
=−¯a(I−P−)(¯bψ)+¯b(I−P+)(¯aψ)
=−¯a¯bψ+¯b¯aψ= 0,
so (¯a−¯b)ψ∈ker¯a,¯b.
Now the operator ˜Jis injective because we assume that a−b/\e}atio\slash= 0 a.e.
onT, so it is left to show that it is also surjective when (6.3) hol ds.
This is obvious if a−b∈ GL∞; suppose now that a∈ GL∞orb∈ GL∞.
We have, for ψ∈ker∗
a,b, which must satisfy (6.5),
(¯a−¯b)ψ=φ⇐⇒¯aψ/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈H2
0−¯bψ/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈H2=φ⇐⇒¯aψ=φ−and¯bψ=−φ+.
13Thus we have, since ¯ aφ++¯bφ−= 0,
ψ=φ−
¯a=˜J−1φifa∈ GL∞
and
ψ=−φ+
¯b=˜J−1φifb∈ GL∞.
Corollary 6.5. With the same assumptions as in Proposition 6.4, if (6.3)
holds, then
˜J−1: ker¯a,¯b→ker∗
a,b
is deﬁned by
˜J−1φ=

φ
¯a−¯bifa−b∈ GL∞,
P−φ
¯aifa∈ GL∞,
−P+φ
¯bifb∈ GL∞.
Corollary 6.6. Ifker¯a,¯b={0}, thenker∗
a,b={0}.
Taking Proposition 6.3 into account, we also have:
Corollary 6.7. The following are equivalent:
(i)kerb,a={0};
(ii)ker¯a,¯b={0};
and, if at least one of a,banda−blies inGL∞,
(iii)ker∗
a,b={0}.
We can now formulate a generalization of Coburn’s lemma for T oeplitz
operators [8].
Theorem 6.8. Suppose that a,b/\e}atio\slash= 0a.e. onT. Then
(i) We have kera,b={0}orkerb,a={0}; equivalently kera,b={0}or
ker¯a,¯b={0}.
(ii) If at least one of a,banda−blies inGL∞, thenkera,b={0}or
ker∗
a,b={0}.
14Proof.Suppose that there exist φ,ψ/\e}atio\slash= 0 withφ∈kera,b,ψ∈kerb,a. Then
clearly
aφ+=−bφ−andbψ+=−aψ−.
Thereforeabφ+ψ+=abφ−ψ−, and, since a,b/\e}atio\slash= 0 a.e. on T, we have
φ+ψ+/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈H1=φ−ψ−/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
∈H1
0,
so both the terms above are 0. This implies that either φ+= 0 orψ+= 0
and therefore, by Remark 4.2, φ= 0 orψ= 0, which is a contradiction.
Therefore we cannot have both ker a,b/\e}atio\slash={0}and ker b,a/\e}atio\slash={0}; by Corollary
6.7, ker b,a/\e}atio\slash={0}is equivalent to ker¯a,¯b/\e}atio\slash={0}.
Finally, (ii) follows from Corollary 6.7 (iii).
Clearly the theorem does not apply to the cases a= 0 a.e. or b= 0 a.e.,
as is easily veriﬁed.
We recover Coburn’slemma when b= 1. In that case we have ker( aP++
P−) ={0}or ker(¯aP++P−) ={0}, where ker( aP++P−)≃kerTaand
ker(¯aP++P−)≃kerT∗
a(cf. (4.3)).
7 Final comments
In [11, 12, 13], a new class of Toeplitz-like operators Tωis presented, whose
symbols are complex rational functions ω. The domain of Tωis
{g+∈Hp:ωg+=f+ρ},
wheref∈Lpandρis a strictly proper (i.e., zero at ∞) rational function
with all poles on T. Then the authors write Tωg+=P+f. The operator
is densely-deﬁned as its domain contains all polynomials. I ts kernel is then
deﬁned to be those g+withωg+=f−+ρ.
Now, in the context of paired operators, we may take a more gen eral
ω=φ/pwhereφ∈L∞andpis a polynomial with all zeros on T. We would
naturally consider the kernel associated with the bounded paired operator
Sφ,−p, since we then have, for Sφ,−pg= 0,
φg+=pg−,that is, ωg+=g−.
In general this gives a diﬀerent outcome, as can be seen with th e example
ω(z) = 1/(z−1). ItsTωkernel is thespace of all g+withg+/(z−1) =f−+ρ.
15However, the kernel of S1,1−zis the space of all gwithg++(1−z)g−= 0.
Thus the kernels are diﬀerent, namely Cin the ﬁrst case and {0}in the
second.
Finally, another recent paper that studies pairs of project ions (but in the
context of model spaces, giving insights into truncated Toe plitz operators)
is [10].
