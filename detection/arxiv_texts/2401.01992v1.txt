Abstract. In this manuscript, we show that there are three fundamental building blocks
supporting the Cosmological Principle. The ﬁrst of them sta tes that there is a special frame
in the universe where the spatial geometry is intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic. The
second demands the existence of a ﬁducial observer to whom th e Hubble parameter is
isotropic. The last piece states that matter and radiation b ehave as a perfect ﬂuid. We
show that these three hypotheses give us the Friedmann-Lema ître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
spacetimes, the central pillar of the standard model of Cosm ology. We keep with the
ﬁrst of them and start to investigate the so-called intrinsi cally homogeneous and isotropic
spacetimes. They emerge after the decoupling of the CMB with the geometric frame of
reference. Furthermore, a “ ΛCDM-like" effective theory arises naturally in those backg rounds,
together with some new density parameters relating to the lo cal inhomogeneities, the internal
energy density, and the local and global magnitudes of the Hu bble anisotropy. All those
properties make this class of inhomogeneous models, which r oughly speaking, keeps "1/3"
of the Cosmological Principle, worth investigating in appl ications to Cosmology, for it can
accommodate the same ingredients of the standard model, as a geometric frame and a free-
falling isotropic cosmic background radiation, and reduce to the latter when some observable
parameters vanish.Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 2
1. Introduction
Cosmology has been established on the belief that the Univer se is homogeneous and isotropic
on large scales. Although this is a quite vague notion, it is l argely accepted that, when put
on sound mathematical grounds, the Cosmological Principle is equivalent to demanding the
spacetime Mto be of the FLRW type, named after their precursors Friedman n-Lemaître-
Robertson-Walker. It stands as a framework around which the standard model of Cosmology
is built [1, 2]. Nonetheless, the recent observational data have been testing the limits of
this theory, and their tenets were put under intense scrutin y after the discovery of many
“tensions" [3]. In particular, the observational basis for the Cosmological principle has been
investigated in many aspects [4], and the doubts on whether i t is indeed suitable to describe our
large-scale universe have been growing in the last few years [5,6]. Regardless of the outcome
of this cosmic conundrum but still inspired by this current d ebate, in this manuscript, we shall
pay a visit to the mathematical hypotheses that lead us to the FLRW spacetimes, keeping
those of more fundamental relevance, while re-considering the role of the others, for which
the validity is a matter of observational veriﬁcation.
The FLRW spacetimes are characterized by their highly symme tric spatial sections: there
is a Lie group acting on Mby isometries whose orbits are space-like hypersurfaces, t he
homogeneity condition, with a transitive induced action of the isotropy group on their tangent
spaces, the isotropic character of the action. A well-known theorem ensures the existence of
a special coordinate representation where the metric is com pletely characterized by the scale
factor a(t)and the constant K0representing the spatial curvature [7]. As we open up the man y
restrictions imposed by the large symmetry group of the FLRW spacetimes, we come to the
conclusion that such models are characterized by the vanish ing of many spatial anisotropies.
In fact, the spatial geometry, the Hubble expansion, the ene rgy ﬂux, and the pressure coming
from the matter content, impose no spatial asymmetry along t he many allowed directions in
such spacetimes.
As we move towards the foundations of the Cosmological Princ iple, we ﬁrst realize that
it demands space to have the simplest of the geometries, thos e which do not distinguish two
different directions nor distinct points. These homogeneo us and isotropic environments are
the simply connected Riemannian manifolds with constant se ctional curvature K0, which are
restricted to three types of space: The Euclidean ( K0=0), the hyperbolic ( K0<0), and the
spheric ( K0>0) [8, 9]. We can set this condition as the existence of specia l observers in
the Universe, represented by a time-like unitary vector ﬁel d u, to whom the notions of space
and time are naturally distinguished, that is, u has vanishi ng vorticity ‡, such that the equal-
time spatial sections have one of those simplest conﬁgurati ons. They are formally deﬁned in
hypothesis H1, and the resulting structure is called intrin sically homogeneous and isotropic
spacetime, the subject of investigation in this manuscript . They constitute a subclass of the
broader family of spacetimes admitting intrinsic symmetri es [11–13].
The second fundamental notion behind the Cosmological Prin ciple is the isotropy of
‡ If u has non-vanishing vorticity, then its orthogonal spac e distribution is no longer integrable ( [10], chapter
4). Hence, the notion of “space" to those observers cannot be given by a unique natural choice.Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 3
the Hubble sky, that is, the property of expanding equally in all directions. It has a strong
observational appeal, so much so that its validity has been q uestioned in some recent data
analyses (see Ref. [4] and references therein). Regardless of the constraints imposed by
observational Cosmology, this piece of the Cosmological Pr inciple has its own subtleties to
be understood and dealt with even on a theoretical basis. Non etheless, the Hubble isotropy
dwells in the core of the standard model of Cosmology and is la rgely accepted in the scientiﬁc
community. The intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic sp acetimes readily recover this
feature under the assumption of the existence of a ﬁducial ob server to whom the Hubble sky
is the same in all directions. In addition, we also assume tha t it is able to distinguish a scale
factorℓsuch that the local volume grows with ℓ3, if we are in a four-dimensional spacetime,
and the curvature decreases as ℓ−2. This is the second piece of the Cosmological Principle,
written down in hypothesis H2.
The third and last piece is the isotropy of the physical const ituents of matter and radiation.
It has a strong physical appeal by stating that there is no net energy ﬂux nor anisotropic stress
in the universe. In fact, as we settle the cosmological obser vers as those to whom the cosmic
background radiation (CMB) is nearly isotropic, for instan ce, it represents the idea that there
would be no giant magnetic ﬁeld, nor any constituent of matte r moving in a relativistic speed,
nor any phenomena that could account for signiﬁcant breakin g of the perfect ﬂuid form of the
energy-momentum tensor. It is set in the hypothesis H3.
Those are the three building blocks of the Cosmological Prin ciple, put down in section2.
The ﬁrst, mathematical, ensures the homogeneity and isotro py of the spatial geometry to
describe the universe. The second, observational, guarant ees isotropic expansion. The third,
physical, assumes a perfect ﬂuid form for the overall combin ation of matter and radiation. As
we put all of them together and assume Einstein’s equations t o hold, we recover the FLRW
spacetime, with each one of these assumptions being absolut ely necessary for it. We discuss
that in section 4.
The main purpose of this manuscript is to start investigatin g the intrinsically
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, whose mathematical foundations are the subject of
section 3. This is a framework where just the ﬁrst “1/3" of the Cosmological Principle is kept.
It turns out that this structure naturally appears when we al low the CMB observers to decouple
from these geometric ones, as discussed in section 6. It corr esponds to that counterpart less
accessible by our direct observations or our physical intui tion, and therefore, less likely to be
ruled out by physical considerations or surveys probing the cosmological sky. In this sense,
the hypothesis of homogeneity and isotropy of spatial geome try seems to be the one to keep
with, while leaving the rest "2/3" to observational scrutin y. Even large-scale homogeneity and
aΛCDM-like approach to Cosmology naturally arise from this ri ch framework, as we show
in sections 5 and 7, respectively. The notations and sign con ventions follow Ref. [10].
2. On the hypotheses laying in the foundations of the Cosmolo gical Principle
Here we follow a methodology closely related to the co-movin g approach of General
Relativity, very often used in Cosmology [10, 14], differin g from it only in some choices ofBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 4
variables and in the interpretation that our reference syst em will not be necessarily co-moving
with a ﬂuid. We start with a m-dimensional spacetime Mendowed with the Lorentzian metric
g and establish our cosmological observers by choosing a tim e-like vector ﬁeld u, oriented
to the future, unitary, u2=−1, and vorticity-free, that is, its orthogonal distributio n u⊥is
integrable. This last condition ensures that we are not brea king the isotropy condition from
the beginning, for otherwise, we would have the vorticity ve ctor pointing to some preferred
direction, at least if dim M=4. It stands as the intuitive notion of a “rigid" system of
observables, with no relative rotation among its constitue nts. Furthermore, the curvature of
the spatial sections orthogonal to u should not distinguish between two different points or
directions, meaning that our space sections have constant s ectional curvature [8, 9].
Looking for a conceptual understanding of the mathematical foundations behind the
Cosmological Principle, we set our ﬁrst hypothesis as follo ws:
Hypothesis 1 In the spacetime Mwith metric gthere is a time-like vector ﬁeld u, oriented to
the future, unitary, u2=−1, and vorticity-free. For each point p ∈M, the maximum integrable
manifold of u⊥passing through p, Sp, the spatial section at p, is a space of constant curvature
K(p)with the inherited Riemannian metric
h=g+u♭u♭, (1)
where u♭:=g(u,·)is the 1-form naturally associated to uthrough g, the lowering of its
index. Any two spatial sections are diffeomorphic. Such spa cetimes are called intrinsically
homogeneous and isotropic.
Throughout the manuscript, we assume hypothesis 1 to hold, s o that our investigation is
concentrated on the general intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes. In this
context, there is a natural splitting in our spacetime settl ing our choices for time and space,
respectively, notions of which can be incorporated into any tensor ﬁeld. For instance, we will
denote ϕ:M→Rby a time function whenever dϕ(p)·v=0 for every p∈Mandv∈u(p)⊥.
Analogously, it is a space function if dϕ·u=0. A vector ﬁeld Xis a time vector ﬁeld if it is
everywhere proportional to u and a space vector ﬁeld if it is e verywhere orthogonal to u. Any
covariant tensor ﬁeld in Mis also referred to as a space tensor ﬁeld if it vanishes whene ver
contracted with u, and so on. Moreover, the spatial gradient is the spatial projection of the
gradient, which coincides with the gradient deﬁned in the in trinsic Riemannian geometry of
each spatial section (denote u ·φ:=uν∂νφ) :
∇φ=∇φ+(u·φ)u. (2)
An important role is played by the acceleration vector ﬁeld ∇uu. Besides being
orthogonal to u, its associated one form ∇uu♭:=g(∇uu,·), which in coordinate representation
is simply ∇uuν, is closed when restricted to each space section Sp, a fact that is equivalent to
the vanishing of the vorticity of u (Compare with formula (4. 36) in [10]). From that intrinsic
viewpoint, it is locally the spatial gradient of a “potentia l". In a more precise manner, in the
following lemma, we establish this well-known result, for t he sake of completeness:Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 5
Proposition 1 Letube a time-like and vorticity-free vector ﬁeld and U an open se t inMsuch
thatSp∩U is connected and simply connected along each spatial secti onSp, p∈U. There
are smooth functions, a time t :U→Rand a “potential" φ:U→R, such that each space
sectionSpis locally characterized by t =t(p), that is,Sp∩U=t−1(t(p)), and the spatial
gradient of φgives the acceleration vector,
∇φ=∇uu. (3)
Furthermore, any two “potentials" in U differ by a time funct ion in U:
φ2−φ1=ϕ(t). (4)
Proof: With no loss of generality, put U=Mconnected and simply connected, and set a
curve of reference points in each space section by starting f rom a point p0∈Mﬂowing along
u,c(t)=Ft
u(p0),Ft
ubeing its ﬂux. If we assume connected space sections, each p∈Mwould
correspond to a time tpfor which p∈Σc(tp). Now we take the integral of (∇uu)♭along a path
lying entirely in Σc(tp), from c(tp)top,
φ(p)=/integraldisplayp
c(tp)(∇uu)♭. (5)
This deﬁnes a function as long as the path in the integral is ta ken to lie entirely in a simply
connected region of Σp, since(∇uu)♭is closed along this space section. By deﬁnition, it is
clear that the space component of ∇φis the acceleration vector ﬁeld. Assuming that both φ1
andφ2satisfy equation (3), uniqueness follows from the fact that forϕ=φ2−φ1andXa
space vector ﬁeld, we have ∇φi=λiu+∇uu and
dϕ·X=g(∇ϕ,X)=( λ2−λ1)g(u,X)=0.
/square
In local coordinates (xµ)=( t,xi)adapted to the observers u, guaranteed by the vanishing
of the vorticity, any “potential" φappears as u =e−φ∂
∂tand in the metric as ln√−g00, that is,
g=−e2φ(t,x)dt2+hi j(t,x)dxidxj. (6)
Note that g 00≈ −(1+2φ)in the nearly Newtonian regime [15]. Therefore, any such
function has a simple interpretation: it is the gravitation al potential in the usual textbook-
like Newtonian limit of General Relativity [15, 16]. Needle ss to say, this special status of a
true potential loses its meaning in General Relativity. Thr oughout the text, our coordinate
system is assumed to be adapted to u, just like in the formula ( 6) above.
An u-observer is a curve c(t)which is an integral line of u, that is, ˙ c(t)=u(c(t)). Due
to the gauge freedom of proposition 1, we can always assume φto satisfy φ(c(t)) = 0, so
that in u-adapted coordinates, c(t)=( t,x0)for a ﬁxed x0. Moreover, ∇˙c(t)˙c(t)=∇uu(c(t))=
∇φ(c(t)), that is, c(t)is a geodesic if, and only if, ∇φ(c(t))= 0. This is the relativistic way to
express that there is no net gravitational force acting on th is observer.
Another important geometric structure induced by u is the ex pansion tensor [10], θµ
ν,
which is the symmetric component of the spatial projection o f∇µuν. Since its skew-Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 6

The Hubble parameter has another well-known interpretatio n: the u-observer passing at
p=(t1,x1), which in the adapted coordinates (6) is just the curve c(t)=( t,x1), measures the
inﬁnitesimal spatial volume dV(t)at each instant of time, giving rise to the volumetric scale
factor at p,ℓV(t), with
dV(t)=ℓV(t)m−1dV(t1)and H(t,x1)=1
ℓV(t)dℓV(t)
dτ1, (11)
where dτ1=eφ(t,x1)dtis its proper-time. This means that H measures the expansion rate of
the universe with respect to the volumetric scale factor. In a similar manner, if the scalar
curvature of the spatial sections does not vanish along the o bserver passing at p,R(t,x1)/ne}ationslash=0,
we can deﬁne the curvature scale factor and its ratio by, resp ectively,

Our general intuition involving volume, area, and curvatur e would demand the factors ℓm−1,
ℓ2, andℓ−2, respectively, as we re-deﬁne the length scale by a factor ℓ. In that case, we would

haveℓV=ℓK. In General Relativity, things can get much more complicate d, in part due to
the freedom of choice of the observers u, and consequently to the evolution of the induced
spatial geometry. Nonetheless, in the late-time universe, we could imagine that some special
observers would be free-falling in a "calm" region of the uni verse, where our naive basic
intuition on re-scaling parameters holds true. For this rea son, we deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 1 Anu-observer c (t)is called ﬁducial if the following conditions hold:
(i) It is free-falling, that is, c (t)is a geodesic;
(ii) If R/ne}ationslash=0, then the curvature and volumetric scale factors coincide a long c(t);
After setting our considerations on the Hubble parameter an d its anisotropy, we are ready
to formulate what we mean by the second piece of the Cosmologi cal Principle:
Hypothesis 2 There is a ﬁducial u-observer c (t)to whom the Hubble parameter is isotropic,
that is, Σ(c(t))= 0.
The splitting of space and time imposed by the u-observers na turally and uniquely
decomposes the energy-momentum tensor as [10]
Tµν=ρuµuν+qµuν+qνuµ+Phµν+πµν, (13)
where ρ=Tµνuµuνis the energy density, qµ=−/parenleftbig
Tµνuν+ρuµ/parenrightbig
is the spatial vector ﬁeld
(qµuµ=0) representing the energy ﬂux, P= (Tµ
µ+ρ)/(m−1)is the relativistic pressure,
and πµνis the anisotropic stress, which is symmetric, spatial ( πµ
νuν=0), and traceless
(πµ
µ=0). We recall that this decomposition does not presuppose a s ingle ﬂuid in our
spacetime. In an environment with many ﬂuids, Tµν=T(a)
µν+T(b)
µν+...and the energy density
isρ=ρ(a)+ρ(b)+..., where ρ(a)=T(a)
µνuµuν, and so on. Hence, the physical parameters
of the energy-momentum tensor described above are effectiv e in the sense that they sum all
the contributions coming from every component of matter and radiation present in our model.
Furthermore, u is not necessarily assumed to be co-moving wi th any of them.
The last ingredient of the Cosmological Principle is the abs ence of anisotropies in the
energy and momentum as it is seen by the u-observers:
Hypothesis 3 The total energy-momentum tensor has a perfect ﬂuid form T µν=ρuµuν+
Phµνin the referential frame of the u-observers.
These three hypotheses put together with the Einstein’s equ ations give us the
Cosmological Principle (Theorem 3). The ﬁrst of them, H1, st ates that there are special
observers in the universe to whom the spatial geometry is int rinsically homogeneous and
isotropic, a matter of mathematical aesthetics and simplic ity while establishing the framework
where Cosmology is built onto. The second, H2, has a stronger observational appeal, as it
states that there is a preferred observer to whom the Hubble p arameter is isotropic in a region
where the curvature and the volume scale properly. The third , H3, concerns the physical
aspects of the universe by demanding matter and radiation to behave as an effective perfect
ﬂuid. Each one is necessary to obtain the Friedmann-Lemaîtr e-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 8
spacetime, and therefore, to set the central pillar of the st andard model of Cosmology, as
we will see in section 4. In other words, they are the fundamen tal building blocks of the
Cosmological Principle.
3. Intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes
3.1. Local coordinate representation
We begin by analyzing the local form of the intrinsically hom ogeneous and isotropic
spacetimes. We recall that among the complete and simply con nected Riemannian spaces
of constant curvature, there are only three possibilities: the Euclidean space Em−1, the Sphere
Sm−1and the Hyperbolic Space Hm−1. Any other, as far as it is complete, is the quotient
of one of them with a discrete subgroup of isometries. Despit e the different topologies they
can have, thus differing globally, locally they are all isom etric as far as they have the same
curvature, K, putting them in three distinct homothetic classes, depend ing on whether K<0,
K=0 orK>0 [8,9]. In our general relativistic context, each leaf of th e foliation deﬁned along
the hypothesis H1 behaves just as equal. The difference betw een the theory of the spaces of
constant curvature and our relativistic framework is that w e have to cope with the geometry
varying with time. In order to avoid topological problems ap pearing in the aforementioned
global context, we assume the curvature to keep its sign alon gM, that is, K=0 throughout
MorK(p)K(q)>0 for any two points p,q∈M. The result is laid down in the following
theorem:
Theorem 1 Let(M,g)be an intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetime wi th respect
to the set of observers described by the time-like and vortic ity-free vector ﬁeld u,u2=−1.
For each spatial section orthogonal to u, denote its spatially constant curvature by the time
function K, which does not change sign along M. Hence, around any point p ∈M, there is a
chart ϕ=(t,x)deﬁning coordinates where the metric is represented as
g=−e2φ(t,x)dt2+a(t)2γik(t)dxidxk
/parenleftBig

with det(γi j(t))= 1,ϕ(p)=( t0,0), and xi
0(t0)=0. We call ϕa canonical coordinate system
centered at p.
Proof: The case K=0 has been done in Ref. [18]. According to the hypothesis that Kdoes
not change sign, we will assume that K/ne}ationslash=0 for any point in M. Since u is vorticity-free, we
can take an open neighborhood /tildewideU⊂Mof a given point p0inMwhere there is an adapted
coordinate system (˜t,˜x), as in formula (6), for which /tildewidehik(˜t,˜x)has constant curvature K(˜t). For
each time ˜t, since spaces of constant curvature are conformally ﬂat, we can deﬁne a function
ψ(˜t,˜x)such that ψ(˜t,˜x)2/tildewidehik(˜t,˜x)is a family of matrices with unitary determinant representi ng
ﬂat metrics parametrized by ˜t. In this case, ψ(˜t,˜x)is deﬁned by det (/tildewidehik(˜t,˜x))−1/2(m−1), that is,
it is smooth. Hence, ψ2g is a space-ﬂat metric in /tildewideU, implying that we can use the propositionBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 9
1 of Ref. [18] in order to obtain a new coordinate system ϕ=(t,x)around p, also adapted to
the observer u, such that
hik(t,x)=1
ψ(t,x)2γik(t). (15)
As we ﬁx t0with pin the spatial section t=t0and apply a well-known theorem [8] for this
Riemannian manifold with metric h i j(t0,x)of constant curvature K0=K(t0), we can assume,
without loss of generality, that the spatial coordinates xiare centered at pwith
ϕ(p)=( t0,0),γik(t0)=δik,and ψ(t0,x)=1+(K0/4)δikxixk.(16)
Since the curvature tensor of h ik(t,x), as a metric with constant curvature, is
Ri jkℓ=K(t)ψ(t,x)−4/parenleftbig
γik(t)γjℓ(t)−γiℓ(t)γjk(t)/parenrightbig
,
a straightforward calculation of Ri jkℓusing the relation (15) and posterior comparison with
the formula above lead us to
χikγjℓ(t)+χjℓγik(t)−χiℓγjk(t)−χjkγiℓ(t)=0, (17)
where
χik=/parenleftBig
K(t)−γjℓ(t)∂jψ∂ℓψ/parenrightBig
γik(t)−2ψ∂i∂kψ. (18)
If we ﬁrst contract the above expression with hjℓ(t), we get(m−3)χik=−χ γik(t),χ=
χjℓγjℓ(t), and then with γik(t), we obtain that χ=0, and therefore that χik=0.
For each t, deﬁne yk=Ak

with A(t),yk

ψ(t,y)=A(t)δik(yi−yi

obtain
ψ(t,x)=A(t)

A simple comparison with the initial condition for ψin equation (16) tells us that A(t0)=K0,

0(t0)=0 and B(t0)=1. Hence, we set a(t)=det(γi j(t))1/2(m−1)/B(t)and change γi j(t)=
B(t)2a(t)2/hatwideγi j(t), with det(/hatwideγi j)=1. As we ommit the hat in /hatwideγi j, we get the representation given
in the formula (14), thus proving the theorem. /square

Formulas as (22) are usual to the so-called Stephani-Barnes spacetimes [19–23], that is,
those Hubble-isotropic ( Σ=0), or shear-free, where H1 and H3 also hold. In that case, the
curve x0(t)is often called the “wandering center of symmetry". We can el iminate it in the
vicinity of the free-falling observers to whom the Hubble pa rameter looks homogeneous in
the ﬁrst-order approximation. Rigorously, we have:
Theorem 2 In an intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetime wh ere the curvature
does not change sign, around each free-falling u-observer c (t)for which the Hubble
parameter is spatially homogeneous up to the ﬁrst order, tha t is, ∇H(c(t)) = 0, there is a
coordinate system adapted to uwhere c(t)=( t,0)and the metric is

with det(γi j(t))= 1. In particular, if it is a ﬁducial u-observer, then K (t)=K0/a(t)2with a(t)
standing for both curvature and volumetric scale factors al ong c(t).
Proof: This theorem is needless in the ﬂat case, hence we assume K/ne}ationslash=0. Let us take
canonical coordinates centered at c(t0)=( t0,0)as in theorem 1 with φ(t,0)=0, with no loss
of generality. Since c(t)is an integral line of u, c(t) = ( t,0). The condition of being free-
falling implies ∇˙c˙c=∇uu=∇φ=0 along c(t), that is, ∇φ(t,0)=0. In order for the Hubble
parameter to be spatially homogeneous up to the ﬁrst order, w e must have

Ai. However, since the coordinates are centered at (t0,0),xi
0(t0)=0, that is, Ai=0 for every
i=1,..., m−1. This is possible only if xi
0(t)=0 for any t, which proves the ﬁrst part of theBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 11
theorem. The rest follows from the fact that, if c(t)is ﬁducial, then the volume scale factor
along it is a(t)so that K(t)=K0/a(t)2. /square

for the energy ﬂux, eq. (6.4), for Raychaudhuri’s, and eq. (6 .25), for the Hubble anisotropy
equation.
The intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes ha ve been considered earlier
in the literature, but not in its most general aspects. There are a lot of quantitative and
qualitative results concerning the homogeneous Bianchi mo dels [24, 25], which encompasses
our framework of the free-falling situation ( ∇φ=0). When K=0, it is equivalent to the
general Bianchi I class, and when K/ne}ationslash=0, it means we are in special cases of Bianchi VBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 12
(K<0) or Bianchi IX ( K>0). In the inhomogeneous context ( ∇φ/ne}ationslash=0), Einstein’s equations
forK=0 seem to have been most studied, and a series of exact solutio ns in different contexts
can be found [17, 18, 26–28]. For the inhomogeneous but isotr opic ( Σ=0) case with general
curvature, see Chapter 4 in Ref. [23] and the references ther ein.
4. The three pieces of the the Cosmological Principle
So far, we have described the three pieces composing the Cosm ological Principle. As we put
them together two-by-two without the third party, the space time cannot be FLRW, even when
we admit Einstein’s equations to hold. In fact, we have:
•H2 + H3 + Einstein’s Equations do not imply H1: In any generali zed Robertson-Walker
spacetime [29], obtained by putting φ=0 and h ik=a(t)2γik(x)in formula (6) for the
metric g, every u-observer is ﬁducial and shear-free ( Σ=0). The Hubble parameter
is homogeneous (H =H(t)) and g is a perfect ﬂuid solution of Einstein’s equations.
However, except when γhas constant curvature, it does not satisfy H1.
•H1 + H3 + Einstein’s Equations do not imply H2: Any perfect ﬂui d Bianchi I solution
of Einstein’s equations with Σ/ne}ationslash=0 can be used as example (see the general barotropic
solution in section 4.1 of Ref. [30], for instance).
•H1 + H2 +Einstein’s Equations do not imply H3: for the metric a s in corollary 1 with
K=0, any free-falling u-observer is ﬁducial with Σ=0. In Ref. [17] there is such a
solution for an imperfect ﬂuid.
However, when we assume all those hypotheses and Einstein’s equations to hold, we recover
the mathematical formulation of the Cosmological Principl e:
Theorem 3 An intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetime ﬁlle d with a perfect ﬂuid
where a ﬁducial observer detects an isotropic Hubble parame ter is FLRW around it provided
the curvature does not change sign. In this sense,
H1+H2+H3+Einstein’s equations ⇔ FLRW. (31)
If one of the hypotheses H1, H2, or H3 is lacking, the implicat ion cannot hold true.
Proof: We use canonical coordinates, as in theorem 1, centered at an y point of the ﬁducial u-
observer of hypothesis H2. According to formula (19), Σ=0 for at least one observer means
that ˙γik=0, that is, γik(t)=δik, whith no loss of generality. In particular, Σ=0 everywhere.
Since the ﬂuid is perfect, the energy ﬂux equation (27) impli es∇H=0. This condition and the
hypothesis H2 allow us to apply theorem 2, and therefore obta inxi
0(t)=0 and K=K0/a2. In
particular, we have H ψ=0 and(˙a/a)eφ∇φ=∇H=0, that is, φ=0 with no loss of generality.
In short, we have canonical coordinates as in theorem 1, cent ered at the ﬁducial u-observer of
hypothesis H2, with φ=0,xi
0(t)=0,K=K0/a2, and γik(t)=δik. In other words, a FLRW
spacetime. /square
The characterization of FLRW spacetimes is an old topic in th e literature. The most
famous result is the seminal Ehlers-Geren-Sachs theorem [3 1], stating that in regions whereBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 13
an isotropic CMB is the unique source of energy-momentum, th e spacetime must be FLRW.
Another very interesting characterization relies upon the redshift against the angular diameter
distance up to third order [32], which has a beautiful observ ational appeal. In Geometry, this
kind of problem is often referred to as rigidity conditions f or the FLRW spacetimes (see [33]
and references therein).
The Stephani-Barnes universes [19–23] are "almost FLRW" sp acetimes, characterized
by
Stephani-Barnes ={H1+(Σ=0)+H3+Einstein’s equations }. (32)
Here we have unveiled the two subtle characteristics differ entiating both, which are the
existence of a free-falling u-observer and the fact that alo ng it the curvature and the volume
can be properly scaled. According to the fact that ∇H=0 in such environments and using
theorem 2, these mean that the "wandering center of symmetry " can be settled as xi
0(t)=0
and that K∼a−2, respectively.
5. Naturalness for homogeneity on large scales: the periodi c boundary conditions
5.1. Periodic boundary conditions
One distinguished property of the intrinsically homogeneo us and isotropic spacetimes is the
natural geometric structure they have for building effecti ve homogeneous models. In fact,
we can transcribe in our spacetime the concept that the unive rse, after taking averages on
a large scale, is described by an effective model that behave s like an homogeneous one.
In such a framework, we can smooth the problems arising in the process of “averaging"
in Cosmology [34]. This idea of space being divided into a lat tice formed by identical
regions, with matter behaving equally in each one of its cell s, and therefore giving rise to
a large-scale homogeneous structure, has appeared in the li terature since the 1950s, after
the seminal work of Lindquist and Wheeler [35], and continue d in lines like “Archipelagian
Cosmology" [36–38], “black hole lattice spacetimes" [39], and others [40–44]. Here we
extend the ideas ﬁrst developed in Ref. [18].
The notion of tilling space into identical cells is natural t o spaces of constant curvature,
which can be accomplished in a quite straightforward way. He nce, let us assume that each
one of our spatial sections, identiﬁed with S, is one of the following geometric forms: the
Euclidean space Rm−1, for K0=0, the hyperbolic space Hm−1, for K0<0, or the sphere
Sm−1, for K0>0. Take a discrete subgroup Γof the group of the isometries of the space S
of constant curvature K0, and assume its action on Sis free and properly discontinuous so
that the quotient K=S/Γis a complete manifold of constant curvature K0(corollary 2.3.17
in [8]), which we denote by K. For our purposes here, we shall also assume that Kis compact.
Hence, we have the following picture: the space Sis divided into identical regions, called
fundamental domains of Γ[9], so that any Γ-periodic object, like a function invariant by Γ,
for example, turns out to be equivalent to the corresponding object inK.
Let us translate this scheme to Cosmology by assuming our spa cetime to be composed
of maximally symmetric spatial sections, that is, one of the standard models above ofBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 14
constant curvature K0. At large scales, the universe is quite homogeneous. That me ans
patterns of galaxy distribution and other physical paramet ers are distributed virtually in
an equal manner along identical regions of typical length L>> L0, with L0of the
order of 100 Mpc or greater (see Ref. [4] for an up-to-date dis cussion). These are the
cosmological cells, which we identify with the fundamental domains of Γ, as described above.
Therefore, the “Cosmological Principle in practice" tells us that the inhomogeneities are Γ-
periodically distributed throughout space such that deali ng with these local irregularities in
each cosmological cell turns out to be equivalent as if we wer e in the compact manifold K. In
order to illustrate it, consider the following two cases:
•IfK0=0 and m=4, we could proceed as in Ref. [18] and take our three-dimensi onal
spaceR3to be divided into an inﬁnite number of cubic boxes of length L0, our
cosmological cells. In this case, the discrete subgroup of s ymmetry is formed by the
translations (x,y,z)/ma√sto→(x+nxL0,y+nyL0,z+nzL0),nx,ny,nz∈Z. Hence, the periodicity
of galaxy distribution along those boxes would reduce the ma thematical approach to the
inhomogeneities to the three-dimensional torus T3=R3/Γ. In particular, this periodic
boundary condition would demand Einstein’s equation to be f ormulated in the torus T3,
the compact manifold that we could identify with any one of th e cosmological cells.
•IfK0=−1, we could ﬁrst set m=3, for the sake of simplicity. Hence our spatial sections
would be copies of the hyperbolic plane H2, and the discrete subgroup of symmetries Γ
preserving orientation, called a Fuchsian group, would lea d us to the g-connected sum
K=H2/Γ=T2#...#T2, classiﬁed by the genus g≥2. For instance, if g=2, we would
formulate our equations in the bi-torus T2#T2, which could also be identiﬁed with any
one of the cosmological cells. In this case, the galactic dis tribution would resemble one
of Escher’s “Circle Limit" masterpieces. For the dimension of interest in Cosmology,
m=4, the richness of the hyperbolic geometry allows us to decom pose the space H3in
an immense amount of possibilities.
The preceding argumentation allows us to formulate the peri odic boundary condition by
demanding the spatial functions as H (t,∗),ρ(t,∗), and φ(t,∗)to be Γ-periodic for all possible
time t, that is, they are such that f(t,g·x)=f(t,x)for all x∈S, as "·" denotes the action of Γ
onS(See [18] for examples with K0=0). Formally, we have:
Deﬁnition 2 (Periodic Boundary Condition) The spacetime is M=I×S,I⊂Ran open
interval, and the restriction of its metric gto the space section {t}×Sis a(t)2γ(t), where
(S,γ(t))is a maximally symmetric Riemannian space of constant curva ture K=K(t).
Furthermore, for each t ∈I, there is a subgroup Γ(t)of the isometries of the space (S,γ(t))
such that the quotient S/Γ(t)endowed with the inherited Riemannian metric induces an
isometry onto a compact Riemannian manifold Kwith constant curvature K =K(t)and ﬁxed
volume Lm−1
0. Any function or spatial tensor ﬁeld involved in the dynamic s of Einstein’s
equations is Γ(t)-periodic in the sense that they are well deﬁned in the quotie ntS/Γ(t).
Following the periodic condition above, we shall often iden tify any cosmological cell
of the tilling imposed by Γ(t)at each time twith the compact manifold K∼=S/Γ(t).Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 15
Kdoes not depend on time, even though Γ(t)does. For instance, in the case m=2
and K=0, the only compact and orientable possibility for the manif oldKis the torus
T2, while Γ(t)could be, for instance, the time-dependent subgroup of tran slations in the
Euclidean plane given by (x,y)/ma√sto→(x+etL0n,y+e−3tL0m), with n,m∈Z. In this case,
we identify any rectangle deﬁned by 0 ≤x<etL0and 0≤y<e−3tL0and their Γ(t)-
translations as a cosmological cell, with K=T2∼=R2/Γ(t), and γ(t)as a ﬂat metric on the
torus given by γ11(t)dx2+γ12(t)dxdy+γ22(t)dy2for which the canonical inﬁnitesimal area,/radicalBig
γ11γ22−γ2
12dxdy , turns out to be e2tdxdy , such that T2has a constant area L2
0.
5.2. Naturalness for the averaging process
The separation of the spatial metric into a scale factor a(t)and a Riemannian metric γ(t),
that keeps the constant volume Lm−1
0forK, is strategic for the cosmological applications.
Note that following the canonical local coordinates of theo rem 1 we can put γ(t) =
γik(t)dxidxk/ψ(t,x)2, with ψgiven in equation (21), only if K(t) =K0/a(t)2. In fact, if
we take two instants t0andt1, with γik(t0) =δikandxi
0(t0) =0, with no loss of generality,
and deﬁne the afﬁne oriented coordinates change xi=xi
0(t1)+ai

ℓ=δjℓ,
since det(γi j)=1, we get det (ak

Therefore, the volume of Kat the instant t1is

Choosing an instant t0with a(t0)=1 and V(t0)=Lm−1
0, we obtain
K(t)=K0
a(t)2⇒ V(t)=a(t)m−1Lm−1
0. (34)
In particular, this occurs if there is a ﬁducial u-observer p erceiving a Hubble parameter
homogeneous to the ﬁrst order, as in theorem 2. Moreover, the average value of any Γ(t)-
periodic function does not depend on a(t), for

In the resume, we have a natural geometric structure for the a veraging process induced by
the discrete subgroup of symmetries of the periodic conditi on, such that the problem of non-
commutativity of the time derivatives is smoothed out, and e ven disappears if H ψ=0.Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 16
6. Decoupling the geometric and the CMB frames: the need for i ntrinsically
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes
Let us now identify where the u-observers are, the ones to who m the spatial geometry is
homogeneous and isotropic. We call it the geometric frame of reference. Besides that, we
admit the existence of free-falling, vorticity-free, homo geneous, and isotropic background
radiation whose co-moving frame is deﬁned by the time-like v ector ﬁeld ˜ u, with v=˜ u−u the
spatial velocity relative to the u-observers. The CMB in dim ension m=4 is given by a perfect
ﬂuid energy-momentum tensor with respect to the ˜ u-observe rs whose pressure has three times
the magnitude of the spatially homogeneous energy density /tildewideρr, that is,
TCMB
µν=/tildewideρr
3/parenleftbig
4 ˜ uµ˜ uν+gµν/parenrightbig
,∇X/tildewideρr=0 whenever g (X,˜ u)=0.(37)
From the u viewpoint, this gives an energy-momentum tensor w ith energy density ρr=/tildewideρr,
pressure Pr= (1+v2)ρr/3, energy ﬂux qi
r=ρrviand stress πik
rgiven by the trace-less part
ofρrvivk. Note that at any point p∈Mwhere v=0 these different descriptions of the CMB
coincide.
The fact that the CMB is free-falling means that the unique in tegral curve of ˜ u passing at
pin the instant t0, that is, the curve c(τ)∈Msuch that c(τ(t0))= pandx′(τ)=˜ u(c(τ)), is in
fact a geodesic. As long as we allow the relative velocity of t he CMB frame to vanish along
c(τ),v(c(τ)) = 0, we realize that τ=tandc(t)is a free-faling u-observer. In particular,
∇φ(c(t)) = 0 for every t. In other words, c(t)is a special observer to whom the CMB
and constant curvature frames coincide if, and only if, it is placed exactly where the net
"gravitational force" vanishes, as in the case of the ﬁducia l observers of deﬁnition 1.
Due to the considerations above, if we assume that our geomet ric reference frame does
not coincide with the CMB’s, except for some ﬁducial observe rs symmetrically distributed
along the geometric frame, our spacetime is no longer FLRW, b ut instead, an intrinsically
homogeneous and isotropic one. The discrete subgroup of sym metries deﬁning the periodic
condition of section 5 would be characterized by the disposi tion of these ﬁducial u-observers
along space, at least in principle. Our current measurement s based on the dipole anisotropy
of the CMB can tell us that our peculiar velocity relative to t hese special observers is
something near 300 km/s in a speciﬁc direction [45], but cann ot distinguish this picture from
the canonical FLRW counterpart. Therefore, probing the val idity of the hypothesis stating
that the CMB and geometric frames do not coincide everywhere could be achieved only
through indirect means. For this reason, we must build effec tive cosmological models over
the framework of intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic s pacetimes for later scrutinizing
their observational validity. In the next section, we comme nt on how we could start pushing
forward this procedure.
7. Towards an effective homogeneous model from 1/3 of the Cos mological Principle
Among the intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spaceti mes, those satisfying the periodic
boundary condition of section 5 have a natural structure to b uild average values of the physicalBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 17
quantities. In particular, we can mount effective cosmolog ical models similar to the standard
ΛCDM one, but still quite different due to the characteristic s of the geometric background.
However, there is a warning in advance to the reader: our inte ntion here is to furnish a glimpse
of the potential such models can have in Cosmology. A complet e development of such a
scheme will appear soon elsewhere.
We start by setting the dimension to be m=4 and the scale of homogeneity as L0. We
assume the existence of a set of ﬁducial observers symmetric ally spread in space based on
whom we deﬁne the geometric frame and the discrete subgroup o f symmetries, Γ(t). Hence,
they deﬁne the periodic boundary condition set in section 5, and thus the typical cosmological
cell denoted by Kand identiﬁed with a compact manifold endowed with a time-de pendent
family of metrics h (t) =a(t)2γ(t). In canonical coordinates, they are represented as in
theorem 2, with constant curvature K(t) =K0/a(t)2such that Khas volume a(t)3L3
0. We
deﬁne the mean value of any continuous function as in the form ula (35). We calibrate the
u-observers’ clocks to show the same time t0for "today", that is, redshift z=0, when we set
a(t0)=1. Our fundamental assumption is that those ﬁducial observe rs are simultaneously at
rest in the CMB and geometric frames.
The energy density is split into two parts. The ﬁrst one emula tes the homogeneous
ΛCDM model. For this, we borrow the notation from the standard picture and denote the
critical density by ρc, which we are going to use as a reference for the energy densit y
magnitude. As usual, we deﬁne the density parameters for the dark energy, radiation, and
matter by, respectively, [2]
ρc=3/an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht2(t0),ΩΛ=Λ
ρc,Ωr=/an}bracketle{tρr/an}bracketri}ht(t0)
ρc,Ωm=/an}bracketle{tρm/an}bracketri}ht(t0)
ρc,(38)
where Λis the cosmological constant, ρr(t,x)is the energy density due to radiation, and
ρm(t,x)the part coming from baryonic and dark matter inside the cosm ological cells. The
ﬁrst one is composed mainly of free-falling background radi ation whose frame is moving
with the spatial velocity vdescribed in section 6. The total energy density becomes
ρ(t,x)
ρc=ΩΛ+Ωm
a3+Ωr
a4+µ(t,x). (39)
The last term in the equation above is the internal energy den sity (in units of ρc), which should
be understood as the contribution of anything that could mak e the energy density depart from
theΛCDM proposal. Its physical interpretation would vary with t he background assumptions
on the matter/radiation content, which could stand for thin gs as the internal motion and
interactions within each cosmological cell, the energy of s ome ﬁelds inside them, corrections
due to the fact that the geometric and CMB’s frames are not the same, and so on. In general,
the real aspect of it will only show up when we further investi gate Einstein’s equations in a
desired given situation. The density parameter associated with it is deﬁned as
/hatwideΩµ(a)=/an}bracketle{tµ/an}bracketri}ht,/hatwideΩµ(1):=Ωµ. (40)
Its dependence on the scale factor, interpretation, and rel evance to the cosmological picture
must be analyzed case by case, which should vary with differe nt conﬁgurations for the energy-
momentum tensor.Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 18
The inhomogeneities inside each cosmological cell Kalso contribute with a density
parameter, the one representing the standard deviation of t he true Hubble parameter H from
its homogeneous substitute /an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht. Formally, it is deﬁned as
/hatwideΩI(a)ρc=/an}bracketle{tH2/an}bracketri}ht−/an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht2=/an}bracketle{t(H−/an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht)2/an}bracketri}ht,/hatwideΩI(1):=ΩI. (41)
Hence,/hatwideΩI(a(t)) = 0 if, and only if, the Hubble parameter is homogeneous at time t, that
is, H(t,·) =/an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht(t). It is important to note here that, while the cosmic expansio n occurs
apparently in a homogeneous way driven by a(t), its perception through the u-observers must
take into account their different proper times, dτ=eφdt=da/H, since the geometric frame
is not free-falling. Hence, /hatwideΩI(a)would also be a measure of the dispersion of the u-proper
times along space.
The average value of the standard deviation of the anisotrop y along the cosmological
cells gives us another density parameter, which is deﬁned as
/hatwideΩA(a)=/an}bracketle{tσ2
A/an}bracketri}ht
ρc,/hatwideΩA(1):=ΩA, (42)
where σAhas been introduced in equation (10). Its magnitude has both local and global
contributions. The ﬁrst one would come from the irregular di stribution of matter inside each
cosmological cell, even for vacuum, since the Newtonian-li ke tidal term ∇i∇kφwould behave
as a source for the anisotropy equation (29). On the other han d, the global counterpart would
be characteristic of a large-scale effect. In that case, it s eems reasonable to expect those
contributions to be quite similar to their counterpart in th e homogeneous Bianchi models. It is
common to attribute to this Hubble anisotropy the behavior ΩA/a6, which is characteristic of
a ﬂat and perfect ﬂuid Bianchi I universe [46]. Notwithstand ing, the most expected situation
is quite different, for the FLRW universes are in general uns table equilibrium points in the
Kasner disc [47], and there is a plethora of possibilities fo r the asymptotic behavior even in
the simplest case of vanishing curvature [17, 48–52]. Furth ermore, kind of behaviors such
as the BKL picture of the early universe are not excluded here , at least not a priori, for they
would be a possibility in the positive curvature case [53–55 ].
As we put all the contributions from the internal energy dens ity, inhomogeneities, and
anisotropies, we recover an average version of the Friedman n equation (26), which turns out
to be
3/an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht2
ρc=ΩΛ+Ωr
a4+Ωm
a3+ΩK
a2+/hatwideΩµ(a)+15
4/hatwideΩA(a)−3/hatwideΩI(a), (43)
where ΩK=−3K0/ρcis the density parameter for the curvature, as usual. Clearl y, depending
on the values of the constants Ωµ,ΩI, and ΩA, a new interpretation of the constituents of the
Universe might emerge. In particular, ρcis no longer a “critical" value that determines the
sign of the curvature, for
/an}bracketle{tρ/an}bracketri}ht(t0)−ρc=3ΩI−15
4ΩA−ΩK. (44)
TheΛCDM model is recovered as we set Ωµ≈ΩA≈ΩI≈0. Nonetheless, the vanishing of
these new constants does not imply the background geometry i s FLRW. Instead, it imposesBreaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 19
some constraints on the average values of these inhomogeneo us parameters. That is, even the
ΛCDM model might surge from an inhomogeneous background in th is approach.
As we remarked before, we shall not extend the development of this effective averaged
model, for it requires much more effort and would take us out o f the scope of this manuscript.
However, the arguments put above show us that it is possible t o have an environment where a
ΛCDM-like model naturally coexists with non-linear inhomog eneities and anisotropies, and
therefore turns out to be an interesting arena to investigat e how one affects the others in
different phases of the universe. Hence, it is natural to ask here whether a highly isotropic
CMB would imply ΩA≈0 or how intense would be the natural Hubble tension of these
models. We ﬁnish by commenting on these two topics below.
Since the CMB radiation seems to be very isotropic as it is see n by the ﬁducial observers
to whom the geometric and CMB frames coincide, as mentioned i n section 6, there is a highly
spread common sense that this fact must imply ΩAto vanish, and observational analysis very
often take this implication for granted [56]. Furthermore, the "cosmic no-hair" theorem [57],
which excludes the positive curvature situation, states th at a positive cosmological constant
would exponentially kill any anisotropy in the universe. Ho wever, recent probes suggest that
the Hubble sky might not be isotropic on cosmic scales [4–6] a nd the no-hair argument does
not necessarily imply a collapse of the Hubble anisotropy in the sky we observe today, for
the time required for that mechanism to start is greater than the age of our universe (see sec.
6 in Ref. [16]). In order to show how we can shed some light on th is conundrum, let us
permit ourselves to interpret φas a Newtonian gravitational potential so that CMB/ﬁducial u-
observers are in preferred locations of the late-time unive rse where the net gravitational force
on them vanishes, as for instance, in the center of mass of the ir local galactic cluster. In this
context, it is not clear the constraints a small anisotropy o f the CMB would impinge in the
tidal tensor Φi
knor in the Hubble anisotropy, neither it seems clear the dyna mical behavior
they would develop through the equation (29). Even if Σis small, the simple fact that they
could have different orders of magnitude would leave observ able marks in the deceleration
parameter [58]. Therefore, our background spacetime provi des a natural theoretical arena for
further investigations on the behavior of those anisotropi es and how they would leave their
observational signals in the late-time sky.
We ﬁnally call attention to the fact that a natural Hubble ten sion must arise in our
framework in the late-time universe. The measurement of the Hubble constant from the
CMB analysis would presumably come together with their cosm ological partners from the
ΛCDM model, since they are meaningful in the time of last scatt ering, as it is very often
considered [59]. However, there is no reason to believe, at l east a priory, that we could keep
the same interpretation for the new parameters composing th e average Friedmann equation
(43). In fact, it is the other way around. For the sake of simpl icity, let us consider only the
isotropic context, that is, assume /hatwideΩA=0, which implies H ψ=0 (see theorem 2). Under
this condition, for the ﬂat spatial sections, it has been ver iﬁed that the density contrast in
our model is compatible with our expectations: it allows a ve ry homogeneous early state
to become more and more inhomogeneous as time goes by in the ex pansion scenario [18].
Therefore, if we think that from the time of the last scatteri ng through the era where the large-Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 20
scale structures were formed and until today, /hatwideΩImight have signiﬁcantly changed. Hence, it
seems improbable to conceive it in the determination of the H ubble constant from the CMB
measurements, even knowing that some effects due to the late -time inhomogeneities leave
their imprints there, as the integrated Sachs-Wolf [2], for instance. On the other hand, the
behavior of/hatwideΩµis more difﬁcult to assert in this general context, but it mig ht as well give
rise to some new parameters invisible to the CMB and/or some p ossible contributions to the
ΛCDM existing ones. In the surroundings of the observers to wh om the geometric and CMB
frames coincide the universe is virtually FLRW, for ∇φ=0 along their paths. Hence, the
redshift measurements and the luminosity distance on large scales L>>L0must indeed be
dealt with as in the homogeneous and isotropic standard mode l, except for the fact that we
use the mean Hubble parameter in the averaged Friedmann equa tion (43). From this, we
readily conclude that the usual FLRW formula for the luminos ity distance would be a good
approximation, that is, the formula (Sec. 7.4.5 in Ref. [10] )
dL(z)=( 1+z)SK0/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayz
0dz′
/an}bracketle{tH/an}bracketri}ht(z′)/parenrightbigg
,1+z=1
a, (45)
with SK0(x) =sinx, for K0>0,SK0(x) =sinhx, for K0<0, and SK0(x) =x, for K0=0.
Therefore, the discrepancy in the determination of the Hubb le constant from the CMB and
from the Luminous distance observations is inexorably pres ent in our effective model.
In the literature, one can ﬁnd different tentatives to solve the Hubble tension through
the inhomogeneous and anisotropic context (see section 3.1 . of Ref. [60] and the references
therein). Whether the scheme above will shed some light on or , on the contrary, intensify
the empiric Hubble tension in Cosmology, is a matter of furth er analysis, that can only be
known as we probe inside the parameters /hatwideΩIand/hatwideΩµthrough Einstein’s equations in speciﬁc
situations and examine them against real observations. Reg ardless of the outcome of such
investigations, all the general considerations we have mad e so far are in order to show that the
intrinsically homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes are wo rth investigating, and the effective
ΛCDM-like models arising naturally from them can shed light o n some of the most elusive
problems encountered in Cosmology today.
8. Final remarks
In this manuscript, we have investigated the foundations of the Cosmological Principle, which
has been broken into three parts. The ﬁrst, mathematical, en sures the homogeneity and
isotropy of the spatial geometry to describe the universe, t hus deﬁning the geometric frame.
The second, observational, guarantees isotropic expansio n along ﬁducial observers. The third,
physical, assumes a perfect ﬂuid form for the overall combin ation of matter and radiation. As
we permit ourselves to decouple the CMB from the geometric fr ame, we remain with the
more general structure where just the ﬁrst of those pieces is kept, the so-called intrinsically
homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes. In this context, we h ave an interesting geometric
framework where taking spatial averages and mounting ΛCDM-like effective models, with a
Hubble tension inexorably attached, are naturally conceiv ed. All these properties make them
a proliﬁc arena for further theoretical investigations and astrophysical applications.Breaking the Cosmological Principle into pieces 21
