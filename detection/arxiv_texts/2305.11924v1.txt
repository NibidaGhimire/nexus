 Abstract  
The search for highly effective and environmentally safe photocatalysts for water splitting and 
photovoltaic solar cells is essential  for renewable solar energy conversion and storage.  Based on 
first principles calculations, we show that novel 2D β -PdX 2 (X = S, Te) monolayer possesses  
excellent stabilities and great potentials in solar energy conversion  applications . Comprehensive 
studies show that the β-PdS 2 monolayer  exhibit s semiconductor characteristics with an indirect 
gap, suitable band alignment, efficient carrier separation, an d high solar to hydrogen (STH) 
efficiencies, supporting  its good photoelectronic performance . The surface catalytic and 
adsorption/intercalation energies calculation reveal s that the photogenerated holes have adequate 
driving forces to render hydrogen redu ction half -reactions  to proceed spontaneously and the ability 
to cover and incorporate  water molecules on β -PdS 2 monolayer. Besides,  the β-PdTe 2 monolayer  
is promising donor material for exciton ic solar cell s with high photovoltaic performance. More 
importantly, due to  suitable donor band gap  and small conduction band offset  in the  proposed type-
II heterostructure , the calculated power conversion efficien cies (PCE)  is calculated up to ~23% (β-
PdTe 2/WTe 2), ~21% (β-PdTe 2/ MoTe 2) and ~18% (β -PdTe 2/β-PdS 2), making it a promising 
candi date for solar energy conversion applications .

 1. Introduction  
Solar energy conversion techn ologies, such as photocatalytic  water splitting  and photovoltaic  cells 
are demand ing to produce  clean energy and to reduce  significant environmental and energy 
concerns . Since the realization  of semiconductor photocatalyst TiO 2 for solar water splittin g1, 
researchers have devoted significant efforts to explore effective photocatalysts capable of 
producing  hydrogen energy.2-7. To achieve cost -effective hydrogen production , photocatalysts' 
solar to hydrogen (STH) efficiency should be at least 10% for large -scale production .8 The 
favorable hydrogen  and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) , efficient separation with fast 
carrier migration and robust  light-harvesting, leads to high STH efficiency . Also , the band gap 
must be equal or greater  to 1.23 eV  for a viable photocatalyst , and the VBM and CBM 
appropriately straddling the redox potentials of the water . If these criteria are satisfied , water can 
be split without the need of any sacrificial agents.9 However, due to low quantum efficiency 
induced by charge recombination both on the surface and in the bulk of the catalysts, only a few 
show s good photocatalytic activity for water splitting.10 
In the las t few decades , 2D materials ha ve been suggested as promising  solar energy harvester s 
due to high optical absorption, high carrier mobility  and sufficient reactive sites11-19. 
Unfortunately, many of them have poor long -term enduran ce and are effectively inactive for 
photocatalysis  water splitting.9, 20 Also, the significant energy loss produced by the high 
overpotential in  HER and OER  need to be reduced . Therefore , novel 2D photocatalysts, 
particularly those with low overpotential, are of great interest for realizing  the water splitting  
reaction without the use of sacrificial reagents  or co -catalysts.  
Among 2D materials,  transition -metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)  research ha s sparked a lot of 
interest in the creation of few -layer or monolayer nanosheets.21, 22 These advancements bring new 
life to photocatalytic water splitting  due to the fact that TMDs possess a high optical absorption 
efficiency, high carrier mobilit y, high charge transfer ability  and large catalytic site s.23-25 Despite 
the potential advantages of 2D chalcogenides for photocatalysis, the hydrogen yield from water 
splitting remains low due to the rapid re combination of photogenerated holes and electrons .26 
TMD s with abundant active sites can enhance the efficiency to trigger the overall water splitting 
reactions.  4 
 Besides photocatalyst, the s olar cell  is also an essential renewable energy conversion technology 
that convert s solar radiation directly into electricity . Solar cell materials with enhanced power 
conversion efficiency (PCE) have been investigated continually since the invention of the first  
operational solar cell in 1954.27 For van der Waals (vdW) hetero structure  solar cell s with a high 
PCE should meet  two main criteria.28 First, acceptor and donor materials shou ld have type II band 
alignment s in the heterostructure.  Second, the donor material's ban d gap should be between 0.90 -
1.70 eV to ensure effective light -harvesting performance.  The light-harvesting performance , the 
carrier mobility  and the  separation efficiency of excitons also play essential  roles in determining 
the PCE.29  
Thus, 2D materials also have been regarded as promising candidates  for excitonic s olar c ells 
(XSCs ) due to their adjustable bandgap and good light -harvesting performance  with high carrier 
mobility .30-32 The electronic characteristics of individual monolayers can be tuned by linking their 
band edges using a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure generated by stacking distinct monolayer 
materials.33, 34 Therefore, the fabrication  of efficient type -II vdW  heterostr uctures is considered 
promising for next -generation solar cell applications.  
In this work, density functional theory ( DFT ) computations were performed to describe  the 
photocatalytic water splitting and photovoltaic activity of the β-PdS 2 and β-PdTe 2 monolayer s, 
respectively . We perform molecular dynamics calculations to investigate  these monolayers' 
thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities . Remarkably, the β-PdS 2 monolayer has a n indirect  band 
gap (2.10 eV) with suitable band edge positions , and  the potential  to meet the re quire ment for 
redox potentials of  photocat alysis. The adsorption/intercalation energies  are obtained to check  
whether the coverage and incorporation of water molecules are energetically feasible  or not . 
Furthermore, the β-PdTe 2 monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap  of ∼1.29 eV with suitable type -
II vdW heterostructure alignments , suggesting that it could serve as suitable donor material for 
constructing  2D heterostructure as an exciton ic solar cell. Significantly, the estimated PCE of β-
PdTe 2/β-PdS 2, β-PdTe 2/MoTe 2 and β-PdTe 2/WTe 2 heterojunctions , can be as high as 17.79%, 
20.59% and 23.14% respectively . 
2. Computational method  
The calculated results were obtained by employing density functional theory (DFT) as the  
Quantum -ESPRESSO package .35, 36 We employed the  the Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) 5 
 approximation of the  exchange -correlation  (XC) functional. The convergence criterion for the 
forces was set to 0.01 eV/ Å and a norm -conserving pseudopotential  with a 9 0 Ry energy cutof f. 
The first Brillouin zone ( BZ) integration was performed with 24 × 24 × 1 k -point grid for 
Monkhorst pack mesh . To break unphysical interactions between periodic system images , we 
inserted  a large vacuum of 20  Å perpendicular to 2D structure . Moreov er, the sophisticated HSE06 
hybrid functional  was also used for calculating the electronic structures37, 38. To include  van der 
Waals interactions, we use Grimme’s DFT -D2 approach  for all heterostructure calculations.39 The 
AIMD simulations were performed with  Nosé thermostat algorithm at a different temperature of 
300 K, 500K and 100 0K for a total of 5 ps with a time step of 3 fs  using the SIESTA package .40  
We used  the G0W0+BSE method as incorporated  in the YAMBO code41 coupled  with the 
Quantum -ESPRESSO package  for optical absorbance . To achieve convergence, 200 bands are 
undertaken  in the sum over the state for the correlation part of self -energy. To ensure  the absorption 
spectrum converges, three valence and two conduction bands are used  to solve the Bethe -Salpeter 
equation and  dielec tric function . Moreover, to account  for solvent effects  in simulations, we used 
the imp licit solvent model within  the Environ code42 of Quantum ESPRESSO using the 78.3 
dielectric constant for liquid water . The details of free energy and thermodynamic o xidation a nd 
reduction p otentials calculat ions are summarized in the ESI. 
3 Results and Discussion  
3.1 Geometric  Structure  and S tability  
The bulk β -PdX 2 (X = S, Te)  exhibits trigonal symmetry with P3121 space group43. As shown in 
Fig. 1(a) , the layers  of β-PdX 2 are stacked together along the z -axis through interlayer vdW 
bonding.  The atoms of each layer of bulk β-PdX 2 are located in  four, and six -membered ring 
structures  parallel to the x -axis as helical chain , where each Pd atom is covalently bound to the 
four neighboring  X (X = S, Te) atom s within the chain, and the chains pile up in the y -direction.   
Moreover, i solating an individual layer from the β-PdX 2 bulk yields the structure of the β-PdX 2 
monolayer , as shown in Fig. 1(b) . The optimized  lattice parameters  for both β-PdS 2, β-PdTe 2 
monolayer  are slightly smaller  than the bulk phase. Detailed optimized geometric  properties for  β-
PdX 2 bulk and monolayer  are summarized in Table S1 . 
Experiments have shown that mechanical exfoliation can yield various 2D materials with weak 
interlayer interactions from their bulk coun terparts.44, 45 Here, to explore the possibility of 6 
 fabricating the energetically favorable β-PdX 2 (X = S, Te)  from the s urface of its layered bulk 
crystal , we compute their cleavage energy (E cl) from a 5 -layer slab  mode l with the function of 
separation distance . Note that t his method is highly accurate to calculate cleavage energy 
comparable to experi ments. For example, calculated  cleavage energy of graphene (0.33 J/m2)46 is 
in excellent agreement with the measured value of cleavage energy (0.32 ± 0.03 J/m2).47 
Remarkably, the theoretical demonstration of the possibility of mechanical exfoliation of Ca2N 
monolayer with cleavage energy 1.09 J/m2 48 was recently confirmed in experiments with cleavage 
energy 1.11 J/m2.49 Recently, many 2D monolayers  such as PdSeO 3,12 BiFeO 3,50 SnP 3,51 and 
GeTe52 have been theoretically demonstrated to be potent ial candidates for experimental 
fabrications and have also been experimentally synthesized .53-56 
As depicted in Fig. 1(c) , the E cl are 0.47 and 0.88 J/m2 for β -PdS 2 and β -PdTe 2 monolayers,  
respectiv ely. Remarkably, the calculated E cl of β-PdS 2 is quite comparable with 2D MoS 2 (0.42 
J/m2)57, PdSeO 3 (0.42 J/m2)12 crystal that ha s been realized experimentally via exfoliation 
techniques. Also , the  E cl of β-PdTe 2, is lower  than that of α -BS (0.96 J/m2)58, Ca 2N (1.08 J/m2)48, 
GeP 3 (1.14 J/m2)59 and InP 3 (1.32 J/m2)60. The cleavage energy calculations suggest  the feasibility 
of experimental  fabrication of these monolayers.

distance  for β-PdS 2 and β-PdTe 2 monolayer and four -layer slab  (inset) . Black : Pd atom. Yellow:  Se atom.  
 
Furthermore, t o examin e the energetic  stability  of β-PdX 2 monolayer, we calculate the cohesive 
energy ( ECoh), which is de fined as ECoh=(EPd+EX−EPdX2)/3, where EPd, EX and EPdX2 are 
the total energy of a single Pd, X (X=S, Te) atom and total energy of PdX 2 unit cell , respectively . 
The obtained cohesive energy of 4.0  eV/atom  for β -PdS 2 is higher than that of other  2D materials, 
7 
 such as silicene (3.98 eV/atom) , whereas  the calculated  ECoh of β-PdTe 2 (3.3 eV/atom) is 
comparable to that of  black phosphorene (BP) (3.4  eV/atom)61. Our investigation demonstrates  the 
high feasibility of exfoliating β -PdX 2 (X =S, Te) monolayers from their bulk counterpart as free -
standing monolayers.   
Next , the dynamic stabil ity of the β-PdX 2 monolayers are assessed by examining the phonon  
spectra along  with the high -symmetry points in the Brillouin  zone, as shown in Fig. S1(a ), S2(b) 
ESI. No significant  imaginary phonon modes  are found in the spectrum , revealing  the kinetic 
stability for both  β-PdS 2 and β -PdTe 2 monolayer s. Moreover, t he thermal stability of β-PdX 2 
monolayer is also examined by performing  AIMD  simulations  with a relatively larger  4 × 4 
supercell at 300 K  with a time step of 3 fs.  The small total energy fluctuations  with time suggest 
that both β -PdS 2 and β -PdTe 2 monolayers  are thermally stable up to 5000 fs in simulation ( Fig. 
S1(b), S2(b) ESI ). The AIMD simulations are also performed  at higher temperatures of 500 and 
1000 K  (Fig. S1(c -d) and S2(c -d) ESI), which reveal s good thermodynamically stability of β-PdX 2 
monolayers , thereby, show promises to future synthesis of these monolayers.62 
3.2 Optoelectronic  Properties  
After investigating  the intrinsic stability and the experimental feasibility , we then computed the 
optoelectronic properties for  the β-PdX 2 (X= S, Te)  monolayer . As depicted in Fig. 2(a -b), β-PdS 2

monolayers calculated at  HSE06 functional  level of theory  with vacuum level correction.  
 
and β -PdTe 2 monolayers are indirect band gap semiconductors of 2.10 eV (1.14 eV) and 1.29 eV 
(0.65 eV)  at the HSE06 ( GGA -PBE) level  of theories . The VBM is located at near Y (0, 0.5, 0) 
8 
 point for both β -PdS 2 and β -PdTe 2 monolayers, whereas the CBM lies between the M to Y and Γ 
to X point in the brillouin zone for β -PdS 2 and β -PdTe 2 monolayers, respectively . The d ensity of 
states (DOS)  analysis reve als that the states near the Fermi levels are contributed by the mixed of 
p-orbitals of S/Te and d -orbitals of Pd ( Fig. 2(a -b)).  The spin -orbit coupling (SOC) effect  on the 
electronic band structure is examined at the PBE+SOC level of theory . Our results reveal that the 
effect of SOC on β-PdS 2 (Fig S3  ESI) is negligible , whereas s light band gap reduction (ΔE g=0.25 
eV) has been obtained  for β -PdTe 2 (Fig S4  ESI).  
3.2.1 Carrier Mobilities  
In order to explore  the separation  and migration  ability of photoexcited carriers , we calculate the 
carrier mobilities for β -PdS 2 and β -PdTe 2 using deformation potential (DP) theory according to 
phonon -limited scattering model63 (see ESI). According to our calculated results, the β-PdS 2 
monolayer has isotropic  carrier mobility for electron  (1.04×103cm2V−1S−1 and 1.06×
103 cm2V−1S−1) and hole (2.5×101 cm2V−1S−1 and 2.7×101 cm2V−1S−1) along x - and y -
direction  (Table S 2), while β-PdTe 2 monolayer has anisotropic  values for the electron 
(1.25×103cm2V−1S−1 and 1.6×101 cm2V−1S−1) and hole (1.0×101cm2V−1S−1 and 
5.4×101 cm2V−1S−1)  along x and y -direction ( Table S2 ). This difference in the nature of carrier 
mobility  of two monolayers  can be quantify in terms of the difference in electronegative and orbital 
radii between S and Te atoms that results into different dispersion of valance and conduction bands 
near the Fermi level for these  monolayers. Different dispersion  of bands further leads to change in 
effective masses and deformation potential along x - and y -direction. For example, effective mass 
(0.27 and 1.56) and deformation  potential (Ei= 2.0 eV and 3.38 eV) of electron along x - and y -
direction leads to highly an isotropic value of electron mobility in β-PdTe 2 monolayer.  The electron 
mobility ( μe) of β-PdX 2 (X=S, Te) monolayers  are moderately large an d much higher than that of 
MoS 2 (72.16 cm2V−1S−1)64 and WS 2 (130  cm2V−1S−1)65, demonstrating their fast carrier 
migration ability . 
3.2.2: Optical Absorption Spectra  
To investigate the light-harvesting ability  of β-PdX 2 (X=S, Te) monolayer , we calculate the optical 
absorption  spectra along the in-plane (XY) direction  within the state-of-the-art GW+BSE 
method66, which includes the exci ton effects. β-PdX 2 (X=S, Te) monolayer  structures exhibit 
strong optica l absorption ability , as shown in Fig 3 . Note that  the optical absorbance  (α(ω)) is 9 
 plotted  from the imaginary part of the dielectric function ϵ2(ω) on the basis of the following 
equation :67, 68 
                                                          α(ω)=ω
cϵ2(ω)𝐿𝑧                                                             (1) 
where, 𝐿𝑧 represents the  length of the supercell along the z -direction.  The β-PdTe 2 monolayer 
exhibits relatively significant light absorption with prominent peaks i n the visible region compared 
to β-PdS 2, as seen in Fig 3 . 
Also, the  calculated  excitons binding energy  for β-PdS 2 and β-PdTe 2 monolayer is 0.84  eV and 
0.75 eV, respectively,  which is comparable to  monolayer  Cu2ZnSnS 4 (0.84 eV)69, Janus WSSe 
(0.83 eV )70 and smaller than BeN 2 monolayer (1.07  eV)71. Hence β-PdX 2 (X=S, Te) monolayer  
has enough carriers  to involve in the reaction with effectively separated electron -hole pairs.

the light incident  in-plane (XY) direction.   
3.3 Photocatalytic Properties   
To assess whether the potential of utilizing the β-PdX 2 (X=S, Te)  monolayer for photocatalytic 
water splitting , we further align the band edge  positions with respect to vacuum level relative to 
that redox potential  for hydrogen evolution (EH+/H2) and oxygen evolution  (EO2/H2O) at pH = 0 . 
The potential of the CBM  (VBM)  should be higher  (lower)  than the reduction level o f hydrogen  
(oxidation level of oxygen)  for an overall water splitting photocatalyst . As shown in Fig. 4 (a), the 
VBM and CBM of β-PdS 2 monolayer  surpass the standard oxidation (O2/H2O) and reduction 
(H+/H2) potential  level,  indicating sufficient activity  of β-PdS 2 monolayer  for both OER and HER  
processes . On the other hand, VBM  of the β-PdTe 2 monolayer  is larger than the oxidation level of 
10 
 oxygen (-5.67 at pH = 0 ) (Fig. 4 (b)), indicating that oxidation half -reaction is not possible in β-
PdTe 2 monolayer .  
The external potentials produced by photogenerated carriers directly impact  photocatalytic water 
splitting.12, 72 The calculated  potential of the  photogenerated electrons for hydrogen reduction (Ue= 
energy difference between  reduction potential  of H+/H2 and the CBM) is 0.46 V  at pH = 0  (Ue = 
0.46 +0.059 × pH ) for β-PdS 2 monolayer.  Whereas t he potential of photogenerated holes of  water 
oxidation  (Uh= energy difference between  reduction potential of  H+/H2 and the VBM ) is calculated 
to be 1.65 V at pH = 0  (Uh = 1.65  – 0.059 × pH ). Therefore, at  a neutral environment (pH = 7), the 
Ue and U h for the β -PdS 2 monolayer are 0.87 and 1.23 V, respectively, which indicates the potential 
to have photocatalytic activity  water splitting in the neutral environment .

β-PdTe 2 monolayers along the z -direction  based on the HSE06 level of theory . 
 
To further asse ss the practical applications,  the stability of photocataly sts in aqueous solution with  
illumination  is also checked .  Follow ing Chen and Wang’s method73, we evaluate the  
thermodynamic oxidation ( ϕox) (red line)  and reduction potentials ( ϕre) (blue line) for  β-PdS 2 
monolayer  (see the ESI ). As displayed in Fig. 4 a, the ϕox are lower than the oxidation potential of  
O2/H2O; meanwhile,  the ϕre are high er than the reduction potential of H+/H2, which reveals water 
molecule s will be reduced and oxidized by photogenerated carriers instead of  photocatalysts 
itself .73 Hence β -PdS 2 monolayer  have good resistance to photoinduced corrosion.

 3.4 β-PdS 2 as Photocatal yst for Water Splitting  
The presence of a suitable bandgap,  band edge position and optical absorbance  are not suff icient 
to imply the β -PdS 2 monolayer will act as  a promising  photocatalyst for overall water splitting . 
Therefore, to investigate further the water splitting activity, we examined the feasibility of 
adsorption and intercalation of  water  molecules on the surface of the β-PdS 2 monolayer, 
mechanisms and processes  (Gibbs free energy)  for both HER and OER  and the solar to hydrogen 
(STH) efficiency for judging a material's ability  to split water by photocatalysis .  
 
3.4.1 Surface and Adsorption/Intercalation Energies  
The adsorption and intercalation energie s for the  water molecules are calculated  as Eads/int = E (*H2O)  
− E (*) − E (H2O), where  E(*H2 O) represents  the energy of  (001)  β-PdS 2 with adsorbed/ intercalated  
H2O molecules , and E (*) is the energy of the pristine  (001)  β-PdS 2. Before estimating the 
adsorption/intercalation  energy, we first check the stability of the (001) surface of β-PdS 2 by 
calculating the surface energy in the solvent. The compu ted surface energy  (-0.13 eV ) revealed  
 
Fig. 5  Adsorption and intercalation model: (a) 4 H 2O molecules on  β-PdS 2 (001) surface; (b) 4 H 2O 
molecules intercalated in β-PdS 2 layers; (c) 4 H 2O molecules intercalated in layers and 4 H 2O molecules on 
(001) β-PdS 2 surface.  
 
that the (001) surface of β-PdS 2 is stabl e no matter in a vacuum or solution.  The 
adsorbed/intercalated model is designed by  a three -layer  of β-PdS 2 (001) surface with an area of 
60.2 Ȧ2 and adsorbed ( Fig. 5a ) or intercalated  (Fig. 5b ) with 1, 2, 3, 4 H 2O molecules . The 
12 
 adsorption and intercalati on energy are calculated to be nearly the same (−0.65 eV/molecule and -
0.66 eV/molecule ) for various H 2O coverage’s  (Table S 4) reveal that β-PdS 2 (001) surface  can 
equally adsorb or intercalate H 2O molecules. We also estimate the energy for adsorption (4H 2O) 
with intercalation (4H 2O) model, as shown in Fig 5 c, which result in lower energy ( -0.35 eV per 
H2O molecules ) than pure adsorption and intercalation energy.  These results reveal  that the 
coverage and i ncorporation of water molecules are  energetically feasible , and  water molecules can 
enter spontaneously to  the β-PdS 2 layer.  
3.4.2 Gibbs Free Energy Profiles  
Next, we consider the photocatalytic mechanism and Gibbs free energy profile of β-PdS 2 
monolayer  for HER an d OER processes.  The details of computations can be found in ESI. Note 
that we also include the solvation effect to describe  the thermodyna mics of chemical reactions  at 
the solid/liquid interfaces . As displayed in Fig 6 a, the hydrogen reduction only contains two steps.   
 
Fig. 6 (a) Proposed photocatalytic pathways along with the atomic configuration of water oxidation.  The 
white ball represent s H atoms. The free -energy changes for HER  at potential U = 0 and U = 1.23 V at (b) 
pH=0, (c) pH=3, and (d) pH=7.  
 
First,  the β-PdS 2 monolayer  combines with a p roton and an electron to form a n H* specie s with an 
unfavorable  ΔG of 0.95 eV (HER barrier)  at U=0 . Next,  the H2 molecule is rel eased after the H* 
13 
 bond s a proton and an electron,  exothermic  by nature. Howeve r, when  equilibrium potential of 
1.23 V  is considered at pH = 0 -4, both the steps become  downhill ( Fig 6 and Fig S5  ESI), which 
indicates that the HER  could happen spontaneously on the surface of the β-PdS 2 monolayer  in an 
acid medium under illumination.  At pH=7, an additional external potential  of 0.13 V need to be 
employed to drive  the HER  to occur spontaneously  (Fig 6 d), which is similar to  β-GeSe (0.13 V)  
74 and much lower than β-AuS (0.16 V)  75, β-SnSe (0.16 V)  74, RhTeCl (0.30 V)  76, β-PdSe 2 (0.31 
V) 77, C3S (0.33 V)  78, SiP 2 (0.83 V), PE -AgBiP 2Se6 (1.06 V)  72 and FE-AgBiP 2Se6 (1.62 V)72.  
 
As illustrated in Fig 7 a, the mechanism of water oxidation half-reaction following a  four-electron 
reaction pathway accompanied by  intermediate products.  We compute the Gibbs free energy of 
intermediates (OH*, O*,  OOH* ) and ΔG of elementary steps  to directly characterize the 
performanc e of the β-PdS 2 monolayer ( Table S5 ). Initially, the adsorbed water molecule is

(OH*, O*, and OOH* ) for water reduction . The free-energy changes of oxygen  evolution at potential U = 
0 and U = 1.23 V at (b) pH=0, (c) pH=3, and (d) pH=7. Note: t he white  and red  balls represent H  and O  
atoms , respectively . 
 
 oxidized into  *OH species ; second,  the OH* species  continues to be oxidized into O* in termediate  
after releasing another electron and a proton ; third,  combining with another water molecule, the 
14 
 *O species turns into an OOH* species;  finally, the OOH* species  is oxidized into free O2 
molecule by releasing one electron -proton pair . The third  reaction step, O OH* formation, is the  
highest free energy change (OER barrier) with a limiting potential of  3.62 V (Fig 7 b) in the water 
oxidat ion half -reaction . In the abse nce of any light irradiation (U  = 0) at pH = 0−7 (brown line) , 
the free energy change for step 3  (ΔG OOH*) is alw ays uphill (endothermic) , which means that  the 
water oxidati on half -reaction cannot proceed spontaneously (Fig 7  and Fig S6 , ESI). Whereas,  at 
the equilibrium poten tial of U=1.23 V  (blue line) , two reaction steps  (first and third)  were  still 
endergonic  at pH = 0 -7.  
At U=3.63 V  (green line) , the free energy profile revealed that all reaction steps were downhill . 
Thus, the computed  OER overpotential (ηOER) became 2.65 V (2.47 V) for β-PdS 2 monolayer at 
pH=0 (pH=3) , as shown in Fig. 7( b, c). Remarkably, the value of overpotential (ηOER) is reduced 
to 2.20 V (pH=7) from 2.65 V (pH=0) , as shown in Fig. 7 (d). Consequently, applying an external 
potential of 2.20 V can trigger the OER  in a neutral medium . 
3.4.3  Solar -to-Hydrogen (STH) Efficiency  
The ultimate goal in the research of solar energy utilization  for photocatalytic water splitting is to 
enhance energy conversion e fficiency , which the solar -to-hydrogen efficiency could assess . Based 
on the band alignments, the  energy conversion efficiencies of the β-PdS 2 monolayer  are estimated 
with 100% efficiency  of the catalytic reaction .14 The calculated light absorption (ηabs), carrier 
utilization  (ηcu), and STH (ηSTH) efficiencies are listed in Table S6 . The STH efficiency of 
photocatalytic water splitting for 2D material could be calculated as:  
                                                               ηSTH =ηabs×ηcu                                                        (5)

Where P(ℏω) and 𝐸 represents the AM1.5G solar energy  flux at the photon energy ℏω and energy

Here, the band gaps  (Eg) and  overpotentials of the hydrogen (χ(H2)), and oxygen (χ(O2)) are 
calculated  using HSE 06 hybrid functional  (Table S6 ) to estimate these efficiencies . The light 
absorption efficiency  (ηabs) of the β-PdS 2 monolayer  is 32.35%, and it is highly dependent on the 
band gap value. Moreover, the energy conversion efficiencies of carrier utilization (ηcu) are higher 
than 35 % due to appropriate levels of χ(H2) and χ(O2) for a broad range of pH (0 -7). The high  15

efficiencies of both ηabs and ηcu lead to high STH efficiency.  According to the definition of STH, 
ηSTH of β-PdS 2 monolayer  are larger than 10% for all pH from 0 to 7 with 15.39 % highest for pH 
3 and 4 (Fig. 8 ), which is much higher than that of pentagonal PdSe 2 (12.59%)79, Ga2S3 (6.4%)14, 
Ga2SSe bilayer (7.42%)80 and Al 2Se3 (8%).  Therefore, we believe that the β-PdS 2 monolayer meets 
the critical value for the economically production of hydrogen from photocat alysis (above 10%)8.  
3.5 β -PdTe 2 as Excitonic Solar C ell 
The suitable band gap, high carrier mobility and good solar light  harvesting capability  of β-PdTe 2 
monolayer  may be utilized to c onstruct  next-generation heterojunction solar cell s. We consider 
eight appropriate and lattice -matching 2D materials (MoTe 2, WTe 2, Ga 2STe, InSe, InTe, RhTeCl, 
T-Te and β -PdS 2 monolayers) to build heterostructures with the β -PdTe2 monolayer  (Fig. S7  ESI). 
The electronic band structure of individual monolayers at the level of HSE 06 level of theory is 
illustrated  in Fig. S8  ESI. Moreover, t he structural  and electronic  parameters such as the lattice  
constant , band gap, CBM, VBM,  lattice mismatch,  and interlayer distance with binding energies  
of these optimized configurations are summarized in Table S7 .  Figure 9 a shows the CBM and 
VBM of these eight monolayers (acceptor) and β -PdTe 2 (donor). Encouragingly, the conduction 
band offset of β-PdTe 2, MoTe 2 and WTe 2 are calculated as 0.23 eV, 0.11 eV and 1 meV, resulting 
in high power conversion efficiency ( PCE). 
16 
 The PCE of β-PdTe 2/TMDs heterojuncti on solar cells  is estimated by following the method  of 
Scharber et al .81 The upper limit of PCE at the 100 % external quantum efficiency can be expressed 
as:

deduced from Shockley – Queisser limit .82 The 𝐽𝑠𝑐 is the sh ort circuit current assuming an extern al 
quantum efficiency  of 100%  and 𝛥𝐸𝑐 is CBO between the donor and acceptor.

The PCEs of β-PdTe 2/TMDs heterojuncti on solar cells are  shown in Fig. 9 b (Table  S8). As donor 
materials, β-PdTe 2 has a band gap of 1.29  eV, which is suitable for absorbing  the solar spectrum. 
Also, the combined effects of the matched donor -acceptor band alignments lead t o lower 
conduction band offset, resulting in  high efficiency. The PCEs of β-PdTe2/β-PdS 2, β-PdTe2/ 
MoTe 2 and β-PdTe2/WTe 2 heterojunctions are calculated as  17.79%, 20 .59% and 23 .14%, 
respectively .  
17 
 Table 1  lists the PCEs of vdW heterostructures and other 2D heterostructure solar cells for a more 
intuitive  comparison. Our proposed  β-PdTe2/β-PdS 2, β-PdTe2/ MoTe 2 and β-PdTe2/WTe 2 
heterojunctions have a competitive edge over existing 2D heterojunction solar cells .

4. Conclusions  
In summary, using first -principles calculations, we propose the  2D β-PdX 2 (X=S, Te)  monolayer s 
for efficient solar energy conversion applications . We systematically explored the stability , 
optoelectronic , photocatalytic and ph otovolta ic properties of the new ly emerging β-PdX 2 (X=S, 
Te) monolayer s. The thermal and kinetic  stability evaluated based on  AIMD simulations  and 
phonon dispersion , and the energetics based on cleavage and cohesive energy suggests their 
feasibility for experimental  synthesis.  The moderate carrier mobility and pronounced light 
absorption ability of the β -PdX 2 monola yer make them  a suitable candidate for energy conversion 
devices . The β-PdS 2 monolayer shows  a considerable band gap of 2.10 eV , and redox potential is 
within band e dge position of  VBM and CBM . Especially, the photogenerated  holes have adequate 
driving forces to render the hydrogen reduction half -reactions proceed  spontaneously on the β-
PdS 2 monolayer  at pH= 0 to 4 . Besid es, the additional external potential  of 2.20 V for OER and 
0.13 V for HER would be needed to trigger  the whole sequence for β -PdS 2 monolayer at pH=7.  18 
 Moreover, the adsorption/intercalation energies of β -PdS 2 revealed the coverage and incorporation 
of water molecules are energetically feasibl e with high STH efficiency. In addition , the 2D β -
PdTe 2, as characterized by a moderate  bandgap  of 1.29 eV , and suitable donor material for 
constructing heterostructure  as exciton  solar cell . The proposed  β-PdTe 2/β-PdS 2, β-PdTe 2/ MoTe 2 
and β-PdTe 2/WTe 2 heterojunctions can achieve a power conversion efficiency ( PCE) up to 
17.79%, 20.59% and 23.14% , respectively . It is expected that these new 2D β-PdS 2 and β -PdS 2 
monolayers can be applied in photocatalysis and photovoltaic  in the near future .
