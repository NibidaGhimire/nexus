Abstract. We present a numerical study of relativistic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) ac-
cretion onto an asymptotically flat black hole with synchronized hair. The hair is sourced by
an ultralight, complex scalar field, minimally coupled to Einstein’s gravity. Our simulations
consider a supersonic flow parametrized by the asymptotic values of the fluid quantities and
a sample of hairy black holes with different masses, angular momenta, and amount of scalar
hair. For all models, steady-state BHL accretion solutions are attained that are characterized
by the presence of a shock-cone and a stagnation point downstream. For the models of the
sample with the largest component of scalar field, the shock-cone envelops fully the black
hole, transitioning into a bow-shock, and the stagnation points move further away down-
stream. Analytical expressions for the mass accretion rates are obtained after fitting the
numerical results, which can be used to analyze black-hole formation scenarios in the pres-
ence of ultralight scalar fields. The formation of a shock-cone leads to regions where sound
waves can be trapped and resonant oscillations excited. We measure the frequencies of such
quasi-periodic oscillations and point out a possible association with quasi-periodic oscillations
in the X-ray light curve of Sgr A* and microquasars.

1 Introduction
Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by the accretion of gas onto their central super-
massive black holes (SMBHs) and emit intense electromagnetic radiation in a broad range of
frequencies. Observations of the plasma moving around regions close to the horizon of SMBHs
are now possible thanks to the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which recently imaged the
black hole at the center of the galaxy M87 [1] and of the Milky Way [2]. Black holes are one of
the most exciting outcomes of relativistic astrophysics and general relativity. From a mathe-
matical point of view, there are no restrictions on the black hole’s mass. On the other hand,
astronomical observations clearly indicate the evidence for astrophysical black holes in two
mass windows only: the stellar-mass range ( 4M⊙≲MBH≲80M⊙) [3, 4] and the supermas-
sive range ( 106M⊙≲MBH≲109M⊙) [1, 5, 6]. However, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA scientific
collaboration (LVK) has reported the detection of gravitational-wave transient GW190521[7],
an intermediate-mass black hole of 150M⊙resulting from the merger of two black holes
of masses 85M⊙and66M⊙. The nature of this source remains somewhat uncertain (see
e.g., [8–12] for alternative interpretations). In addition, explaining the masses of SMBHs is
still an important open problem in astrophysics. One approach to this problem assumes that
the large masses of SMBHs are the result of matter accretion onto black hole seeds [13–15].
Therefore, understanding the details of matter accretion onto black holes is of great relevance
on a series of timely problem in gravitational-wave astronomy.
When considering the dynamics of gas around a point mass, one of the most used mod-
els was developed by Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton (BHL) [16–18]. The BHL model assumes
accretion onto a central compact object moving in a homogeneous distribution of gas and
has been widely employed in different astrophysical scenarios, via numerical studies in the
Newtonian regime [19–30]. A historical overview of the development and numerical modeling
of BHL accretion studies can be found in [31, 32]. The validity of a Newtonian approach
breaks down when the accreting object is a black hole or a neutron star, as general rela-
tivistic effects become important, especially when capturing the flow dynamics close to the
black hole horizon (see, e.g., Ref. [33], where a Newtonian and relativistic treatment of mass
accretion in a common-envelope scenario are contrasted). This motivated the first numerical
works dedicated to studying the morphological patterns in the vicinity of a black hole as well
as to compute the associated accretion rates of mass and momentum [34–38]. Subsequently,
– 1 –many simulations have investigated the BHL mechanism in the context of relativistic astro-
physics [39–42], becoming increasingly realistic (and more complex) by including magnetic
fields [43–45], radiative terms [46], density and velocity gradients [47, 48], and small rigid
bodies around the black hole [49]. More recently, the role of BHL accretion in the common
envelope phase in the evolution of binary systems has also been investigated by [33].
If SMBHs result from accretion onto black-hole seeds, a key question is to determine the
interplay between baryons and dark matter in this scenario [13, 50–54]. In this respect, scalar
fields have been proposed to play the role of dark matter, first at galactic scale [55, 56] and
then at cosmic scale [57, 58]. Scalar fields interacting with gravity could therefore play a role
in understanding the physics associated with black holes, in particular its potential impact
on SMBH formation.
Scalar field accretion onto black holes has been already explored in different works. In
the context of the ultra-light scalar fields proposed as constituents of dark matter halos, it
has been shown that the accretion rate would be small over the lifetime of a typical halo, and
hence the central SMBHs could coexist with scalar-field halos [59]. The study of scalar-field
accretion has also been carried out on the spacetime background of boson stars [60] and black
holes [61–63] using “Scri” ( I)-fixing conformal compactification, that is, including future null
infinity I+in the numerical simulations. In the former case, the scalar field shows quasi-
normal mode oscillations only for boson star configurations that are compact enough, where
no signs of tail decay were found. In the latter, an extremely high dispersion rate of the scalar
field density was found.
The possible existence of equilibrium configurations between ultralight scalar fields and
black holes in general relativity has also been addressed in the literature. In [64, 65] it
was shown that a massive scalar field surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole can survive
for arbitrarily long times, as quasi-bound states, forming scalar “wigs”. Moreover, in the
context of the nonlinear evolution of massless scalar fields (also accounting for the evolution
of the spacetime), Ref. [66] showed that scalar fields are allowed to survive outside black holes
and may eventually have lifetimes consistent with cosmological timescales. Further studies
have confirmed the existence of such long-lived states [67–70]. In addition to the idea that
scalar fields can survive for long timescales around black holes, Ref. [71] showed that the
gravitational radiation emitted by a Schwarzschild black hole when a massive scalar field is
accreted exhibits a distinctive signature, a wiggly tail, in the late-time behavior of the signal.
Eventually, true equilibrium states between ultralight scalar fields and black holes in
general relativity were found [72, 73]. A new family of solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon
field equations, where the scalar field is complex, massive, and minimally coupled to general
relativity, was derived in Ref. [72], to which we will hereafter refer to as “hairy black holes”
(HBHs). These solutions describe asymptotically flat rotating black holes with scalar hair
that are regular outside of the event horizon and have the following properties:
•are supported by rotation and have no static limit
•have a conserved continuous Noether charge qmeasuring the scalar hair
•have a Kerr limit when q= 0
•have a solitonic limit when q= 1
Formoredetailsontheconstructionofthesolutionsandtheirdifferentpropertiessee[73]. The
stability of these hairy Kerr black holes was discussed in [74, 75]. In particular, it was shown
– 2 –through numerical analysis that the superradiant instability appears for those solutions [74],
but the corresponding timescale increases with the black-hole mass and can be larger than
the age of the Universe for sufficiently (super)massive black holes [75]. Therefore, these HBHs
provide an interesting model to study the interplay between the accretion of baryonic matter
and dark matter in the context of SMBH-formation modeling.
There exist studies aimed at assessing the astrophysical relevance of the aforementioned
HBHs [72, 73]. For instance, Ref. [76] investigated the shadow produced by HBHs using
backward ray tracing; see also [77, 78]. The extension to electrically charged black holes
(Kerr-Newman solution) with scalar hair can be found in [79]. Properties of geodesic motion
and its relation to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been considered in [80], while the
X-ray spectroscopy has been addressed in [81]. More recently, HBHs have been used to build
relativistic stationary models of magnetized tori in the test-fluid limit [82, 83].
In this paper, we initiate a program to numerically model relativistic BHL accretion
onto an asymptotically flat rotating HBH [72]. In this first investigation, we assume the
test-fluid approximation and neglect the evolution of the gravitational field and of the scalar
field, concentrating only on the dynamics of the fluid. The simulations have revealed that
the morphology of the flow past HBHs is similar to that found for BHL accretion onto a Kerr
black hole and that also in this case an upstream bow-shock and a downstream shock-cone can
be produced and whose properties depend on the relative strength of the scalar field over the
central black hole. At the same time, the phenomenology of the flow is also richer because of
the increased possibility of trapping pressure modes in the cavities that are produced, either
by the fluid or by the scalar field, and that can in principle be observed in terms of QPOs.
The organization of the paper is the following: in Sec. 2 we briefly describe the theory
associated with our specific family of HBHs as well as the sample of (four) configurations
we consider. In Sec. 3 we present the mathematical framework for the general-relativistic
hydrodynamics equations and the numerical setup used. Section 4 discusses the accretion
dynamics and morphology, along with the mass and angular momentum accretion rates for
all HBHs models of our study. Moreover, in Sec. 5 we show an astrophysical application of our
modelbymeasuringfrequenciesofoscillationofresonantcavitiesofoursystemandcomparing
them with the QPO frequencies observed in Sgr A* and several microquasar sources. Finally,
Sec. 6 summarizes our conclusions. Throughout the paper, Greek indices run from 0 to 3
while Latin ones run from 1 to 3. Additionally, equations are written in geometrized units
where G=c= 1.

The HBH solutions of the EKG equations employed in our numerical simulations are
the same as in [72, 73, 76]. Specifically, we consider four illustrative solutions for hairy
black holes. The corresponding scalar field masses and angular momenta are in the range
Mϕ∈[0.022,0.957]andJϕ∈[0.022,0.848], where the physical quantities are displayed in
units of the scalar field mass µ. Some relevant physical parameters of the HBHs used in
our simulations are summarized in Tab. 1. As it can be seen from this table, the relative
contribution of the scalar field to the mass and angular momentum is much higher for the
last solutions ( HBH-c,d), which are therefore hairier, whereas the first ones ( HBH-a,b) are
closer to Kerr. It is worth mentioning that in this work we focus on the impact of changing
Mϕ/MBHrather than studying the other degrees of freedom of the problem, such as the spin
of the black hole or the adiabatic index of the gas. The impact of these different parameters
will be the subject of future studies.

andθ∈[0, π](see also Sec. 4 for a description of the hydrodynamical grid). Additionally,
since the numerical simulations of BHL accretion will be performed in the equatorial plane,
– 5 –θ=π/2, we specialize the HBH solutions to this plane. Figure 1 shows the two-dimensional
morphology of the normalized scalar field around the black hole (left panels, in Cartesian
coordinates), where the red circle marks the location of the maximum amplitude of the scalar
field. Correspondingly, Fig. 2 reports the radial distribution of the normalized scalar field
amplitude. In each solution, the scalar field has a different mass, angular velocity, strength,
and distribution in order to have a self-consistent solution, satisfying the constraints of the
EKG system.

through some implicit procedure. In this work, we are using the method “1DW" to recover the
Lorentzfactorinordertoavoidsuperluminalvelocities, asprescribedinthe BHACcode[85–87].
As customary in these simulations, the black hole is placed at the center of the computa-
tional domain, which is then filled by accreting gas modeled has having a uniform density and

vφ=−v∞H3sinφ+v∞H4cosφ , (3.8)
where Hiare functions written in terms of the metric components and v∞is the asymptotic
velocity of the fluid (see Refs. [38, 40, 42, 48, 88] for more details). On the other hand, the
pressure of the gas is constructed from the definition of the sound speed for an ideal gas, that
is,c2
s=pγ(γ−1)/[pγ−ρ(γ−1)][32]. Based on this, and using the ideal-gas equation of

where the adiabatic index γ, the speed of sound at infinity cs,∞, the asymptotic rest-mass
density ρ∞and the asymptotic velocity v∞are free parameters. Specifically, in this work we
useγ= 5/3,ρ∞= 10−8,cs,∞= 0.1andv∞= 0.5. As a result, the gas is supersonic, with
Newtonian Mach number at infinity M:=v∞/cs,∞= 5.
All simulations reported in this work were carried out in two spatial dimensions using
theBHACcode [85–87], employing spherical coordinates (r, φ)on the equatorial plane and a
logarithmic radial coordinate R:= log( r). The numerical grid over which the hydrodynamical
equations are solved covers the spherical-polar coordinates domain r/rEH∈[1.1,1000]and
φ∈[0,2π]; hence, the hydrodynamical grid always includes the grid over which the HBH
solutions are computed. In the intermediate region, e.g., for 200≲r/M BH≲1000, we simply
employ the Kerr solution in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, since the differences of the HBH
solutions are very small at these distances. In the left hemisphere (i.e., for x <0) we inject
gas with constant velocity and density at the outer radius, using the same prescription as the
initial conditions. On the other hand, in the right hemisphere (i.e., for x≥0), we impose
an outflow boundary at the inner and outer radii for x >0. Periodic boundary conditions
are imposed in the φdirection. For the simulations we use an adaptive mesh refinement
algorithm [89], with three levels of refinement, where the coarse grid resolution corresponds
to∆R= 3.56×10−3for the logarithmic radial coordinate and ∆φ/π= 3.9×10−3for the
angular one. Additionally, we use the finite-volume method to solve the general relativistic
hydrodynamics equations (3.1), with the particular choices of the HLLE (Harten, Lax, van
Leer, and Einfeldt) flux formula [90, 91] and the minmod slope limiter to compute the fluxes
and reconstruct the primitive variables at cell interfaces, respectively [32]. The time update
in all simulations is performed using a third-order Runge-Kutta time integrator.
4 Results
The morphology of the accreting gas after the simulations have reached a steady-state is
shown in the different panels of Fig. 3 for all HBHs of our sample. The figure displays
with a colormap and isocontours the two-dimensional distribution of the rest-mass density
att= 10000 MBHand normalised to its asymptotic value. The morphology of the various
configurations exhibits the typical behavior of relativistic BHL accretion onto a moving black
hole. More specifically, and as first learnt in simulations involving Kerr black holes (see,
e.g., Refs. [33, 38–40, 47]), when a supersonic gas moves past an HBH, a shock-cone appears
downstream, in the proximity of the black hole. This shock-cone is clearly visible not only in
– 8 –Fig. 3, but also in the left panels of Fig. 5, which displays instead the distribution of the Mach
number. Each panel in Fig. 3 reports with red solid circles the location of the maximum scalar
fieldϕmax, while with blue dashed circles the outer edge of the torus of scalar hair, which is
defined as the radius where the normalized scalar field density is five orders of magnitudes
smaller than ϕmax. Hence the region between the two circles can be taken as an indication of
the size of the torus of scalar hair.
Despite these common features, each HBH solution interacts with the inflowing plasma
developing different gas patterns. Such differences can be observed in the shock-cones temper-
ature profiles, velocity fields (see streamlines in Fig. 5), and opening angles θsh. The latter are
plotted in Fig. 4 and are measured as follows. We compute the normalized rest-mass density
as a function of the φcoordinate at r= 200 rEHand then mark the opening angle as the angle
at which the density gradient in the angular direction, ∂φρ, diverges; the opening angles for
the different HBH models are listed in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4 and reported in Table 2,
the opening angle overall increases as the “hairiness" of the black hole is also increased. In
the case of model HBH-athe figure also reports the (downstream) shock-cone opening angle
θshthat shows a monotonic behaviour in terms of Mϕ/MBH. An intuitive explanation of this
behaviour comes when considering that as the contribution in mass and angular momentum
of the scalar hair becomes comparable to that of the black hole, the “local” curvature will
be less severely modified by the black hole and hence the impact of the black hole on the
incoming flow, namely the shock-cone, will be smaller.
The HBH solution HBH-acorresponds to the least hairy black hole of our set and is thus
more Kerr-like. In this case, two shock fronts develop in the flow: first, a broadand strong
bow-shock appears upstream of the black hole with an opening angle φbow∼πrad; second,
anarrowand weakshock-cone forms downstream, similar to what is observed for pure Kerr
black holes. When considering more hairy black holes, on the other hand, the trailing shock-
cone starts enveloping entirely the black hole as the amount of scalar hair increases (see the
transition from model HBH-bto model HBH-d), transforming itself into a leading bow-shock.
The explanation for this different flow morphology has to be found again in the fact that the
curvature, especially near the black hole, becomes less severe as the strength of the scalar
field is increased, so that the impact of the black hole on the incoming flow is less and less
marked. As a result, the second downstream shock weakens up to disappearing, as can be
seen in the various panels of Fig. 3.
Additionally, the different HBH solutions explored in our simulations have different
accretion properties, which can be characterized in terms of several quantities. The first one
is the so-called accretion radius, defined as [32]
racc:=MBH
c2s,∞+v2∞, (4.1)
and which marks the transition of the flow from subsonic to supersonic velocities. The ac-
cretion radius can also be interpreted as marking the spherical region within which gravity
dominates and so it is expected to decrease as the amount of the scalar hair is increased
[cf., Table 2]. Other important quantities are the accretion rates of rest-mass ˙Mand linear

However, before discussing such quantitative properties of the accretion flow, it is useful
to return to the more general morphological properties. To this scope, we note that the
motion of the gas can be best followed through the streamlines plotted in white in the various
panels of Fig. 5, which also reports with a colormap the Mach number in the steady-state
configuration of the flow at t= 10000 M. Starting from a constant velocity flow in the
positive x-direction with v∞= 0.5(note that the streamlines are parallel), we observe that
the bulk of the flow close to the black hole is accreted, while the flow further away is hardly
perturbedbythepresenceoftheblackholeandescapesinitsmotion. Thegasthatiscaptured
experiences a sharp transition from a supersonic flow to a subsonic one as it is braked by the
black hole and subsequently accreted. The Mach number reaches particularly small values
for solutions where the mass and spin of the scalar field dominate over those of the black
hole, namely for model HBH-d. Interestingly, as the scalar hair of the black hole increases, the
velocity distribution becomes more and more spherically symmetric, as can be appreciated
when contrasting models HBH-aandHBH-d.

with a red cross and is commonly referred to as the “stagnation point” rstag, the velocity is

into the black hole or away from it, in the downstream flow. Figure 6 reports the location of
the stagnation point as a function of the mass ratio Mϕ/MBHfor our four HBH models when

to the black hole, at least in the test-fluid approximation. We have verified that this is the case by measuring
the flux of angular momentum at the event horizon.

Similarly, the radial-momentum accretion rate also decreases from model HBH-ato model
HBH-d, which is consistent with the fact that the amount of matter able to transfer linear
momentum decreases with the increase of scalar field. Also for this quantity, HBHs have
quite generically momentum-accretion rates that are three or even four orders of magnitude
larger than pure Kerr black holes.

Theexpressionabove, whichisshowninthetoppanelofFig.7withadashedline, canbeused
to explore, for instance, progenitor initial masses and spins of binary black hole gravitational-
wave events [92–94] when accounting for the possible effects a surrounding ultralight scalar
field might have. Efforts along these lines, albeit without the inclusion of bosonic clouds,
have been reported recently in connection with the nature of the transient event GW190521.
Using Newtonian [10, 95] and relativistic accretion models [9, 33] three possible scenarios
for the origin of the progenitor have been discussed, namely involving primordial black holes,
stellar-mass black holes formed by direct collapse, and intermediate-mass black holes resulting
from the collapse of Pop III stars. Taking into account the potential contribution of ultralight
scalar field dark matter is relevant to further assess those models.

we consider the frequency spectrum of the fluid oscillations that arise within the shock-
cone and that are related to the stagnation point. We recall that the association of QPOs
with oscillations of the shock-cone in the downstream part of a BHL flow was first reported
in Ref. [39]. In essence, it was noted that the shock-cone acts as a cavity trapping pressure
perturbations and exciting specific p-modes (see Ref. [96–98] for a similar process taking place
in accretion disks around black holes in general relativity). For black-hole spacetimes without
scalarhair, it wasfound thatthefrequencies ofthesemodesdependon theblack-holespin and
on the properties of the flow, and scale linearly with the inverse of the black-hole mass [39].
Here, we investigate how much the presence of the scalar field in our HBH spacetimes modifies
the mode frequencies of the shock-cone vibrations and the additional resonant cavities that
emerge because of the presence of a scalar field.
Figure 8 provides a schematic diagram of the possible resonant cavities that can be
formed around the stagnation point, and where pressure perturbations can propagate a dis-
tance Lwithvelocity cs. Tocoverallofthesepossibilities, wedefineagenericresonant p-mode
frequency as fi:=cs,i/Li, where iis not an integer and is used to indicate the different reso-
nant cavities that can be produced in the flow (see Table 3). The first cavity is then formed
between the stagnation point (red cross) and the event horizon, with an associated frequency
fEH(black arrows). The second one is between the stagnation point and the position of the
maximum of the scalar field amplitude (red solid line) whose rotation frequency is ω; the
p-mode oscillations in this cavity have a frequency fϕmax(blue arrows). The third cavity is
that enclosed by the upstream bow-shock and in this region sound waves travel transversally
to the shock with frequency fbow(red arrows). Finally, in the case of model HBH-a(and
of a Kerr black hole) another cavity is present in the downstream shock-cone with p-modes
trapped at frequency fsh.
The resonant frequencies expected on the basis of the measured values of Liandcs,i
are reported for each HBH in Table 3 and in units of 1/MADM. Note that the frequencies
at the shock-cone are different for each HBH model because, on the one hand, the opening
angle increases with the mass ratio MSF/MBH(see Fig. 4) and, on the other hand, the sound
speed also changes when the gas moves from supersonic to subsonic velocities. Similarly, the
frequency fEHis also different for each HBH since the position of the stagnation point changes
as a function of Mϕ/MBH(see Fig. 6).

frequency in this cavity is fϕmax(blue arrows), while the scalar field orbital frequency is ω. The third
cavity is that enclosed by the bow-shock where p-modes travel transversally to the shock-cone with
frequency fbow(magenta arrows). Finally, in the case of model HBH-a(and of a Kerr black hole)
another cavity is present in the downstream shock-cone with p-modes trapped at frequency fsh. The
color map shows the rest-mass density of the gas and the ultralight scalar hair distribution (grey-
shaded area).
The predictions for the expected frequencies can be compared with the power spectral
density (PSD) as obtained after performing a Fourier transform of the rest-mass density
measuredatthestagnationpointofeachHBHmodel. Furthermore, toincreasetherobustness
of our results, we also compute the PSDs in ten detectors located around the stagnation point
and compute the mean and the corresponding standard deviation of the measured frequencies.
Figure 9 shows the mean PSD (colored solid lines) and the standard deviation for each HBH
spacetime (colored shaded regions). In addition, the grey line and shaded region in the top
panel for model HBH-acorresponds to a Kerr black hole with spin a⋆= 15/16 (Ω EH= 0.35),
which we use as a reference2
For all models, we identify several peaks in the spectrum and use vertical lines to report
the predicted resonant frequencies described above. Starting from the reference pure-Kerr
black hole, it is possible to recognize in the PSD the low-frequency p-mode in the shock-
cone fsh(together with overtones at 2fsh,3fsh, and 5fsh) and the high-frequency resonance
between the accretion radius and the event horizon fEH. When passing to the HBH solutions,
it is possible to recognise for model HBH-athe peaks corresponding to the p-mode frequencies
in the cavity produced by the (upstream) bow-shock fbow, the mode at fshtrapped in the
(downstream) shock-cone (present only for model HBH-a), the mode at fEHin the cavity
between the event horizon and the stagnation point, and the mode at fϕmaxin the cavity
between the stagnation point and the maximum of the scalar field. For model HBH-bwe can
clearly identify the main peaks with frequencies at fbow,fEH, and fϕmax, but also some minor
peaks which are related to combinations of the main frequencies, e.g., (fbow+fEH)/2,3fbow,

that the dimensionless spin of the HBH solutions, aBH:=JBH/M2
BH, is not bounded by ±1(see Table 1).
Finally, the rotation of the scalar field is synchronized with the black hole, i.e, the nonrotating solution reduces
to Schwarzschild with zero scalar field.

frequencies we identify in our models, using the same color coding as in Fig. 9, as a function
of the black hole mass.
Unfortunately, the outcome of this comparison is not conclusive for the case of Sgr A*
since the range of QPO frequencies is so large that all of our HBH models can explain the
observed frequencies as due to either to p-mode oscillations trapped in the bow-shock or to
radial oscillations between the stagnation point and the event horizon. We should also note
that the QPOs of a Kerr black hole are also compatible with the observed frequencies, e.g., for
aM∼10M⊙Kerr black hole the frequency is ∼100Hz, (see also the results from [39]). On
the other hand, for the three microquasar sources considered, no HBH or Kerr black hole
can explain the observed QPO frequencies. The only exception is model HBH-a, for which
the low-frequency QPO fbowis low enough to be close to the frequency observed for GRO
J1655-40.
6 Summary
We have studied relativistic BHL accretion onto an illustrative sample of the hairy black-hole
solutions reported by [72, 73]. The hair has been assumed to be composed of an ultralight,
complex scalar field, minimally coupled to Einstein’s gravity. We have considered four so-
lutions, describing HBHs with different amounts of hair, ranging from Kerr-like to boson
star-like. Through numerical simulations using the BHACcode, we have explored the dynam-
ics and flow morphology of a γ= 5/3ideal gas moving supersonically past the four HBHs and
searched for signatures in the observable quantities that may provide evidence of a deviation
from the dynamics expected from Kerr back holes.
ThesimulationshaverevealedthatthemorphologyoftheflowpastHBHsisfairlysimilar
to that found when studying relativistic BHL accretion onto a Kerr black hole [33, 38–40, 47].
More specifically, all simulations lead to a steady-state morphology characterized by the
formation of a bow-shock cone in the upstream part of the flow, where the gas becomes
subsonic, along with the presence of a stagnation point where the flow velocity vanishes.
3Since the rest-mass density and pressure are directly related to the gas temperature (ı.e., T∝p/ρ), and
the temperature regulates the emissivity and absorptivity of the gas, it is perfectly reasonable to relate the
time variability of the physical properties with the variability in the X-ray luminosity. Indeed, this is what is
done when modelling kilohertz QPOs in microquasars (see, e.g., [100]
– 17 –However, as the amount of hair around the black hole increases, so does the opening angle
of the bow-shock-cone, while the stagnation point moves further downstream and away from
the black hole. Both of these effects can be clearly associated to the presence of the scalar
field that distorts the spacetime near the black hole and reduces locally the curvature. The
weakening of the gravitational influence of the black hole as a result of the increase of the
scalar-hair strength has an additional manifestation in the so-called shock-cone that develops
for BHL onto black holes in general relativity and hence without scalar hair [38, 39]. This very
specific signature that is very robust in hairless black holes is recovered in our analysis only
in the less hairy of the HBHs ( HBH-a) and is absent (or is very weak) as the amount of scalar
hair is increased and the overall compactness of the spacetime decreased (the gravitational
well is distributed over a larger volume).
Oursimulationshavealsoallowedtocomputetherest-massandlinear-momentumaccre-
tion rates, finding that they attain stationary values after a (model-dependent) equilibration
time is reached. A semi-analytical fit for the rest-mass accretion rate in terms of the mass
ratio Mϕ/MBHhas been found, which could potentially be used to analyze different black-hole
formation scenarios in the presence of ultralight scalar-field dark matter.
Finally, we have explored how the modifications in the spacetime affect one of the most
intriguing aspects of BHL accretion onto black holes, namely the presence of quasi-periodic
oscillations corresponding to resonant waves trapped in the cavities that are produced in the
flow. The existence of such QPOs, which was first pointed out in Ref. [39] in the case of a
Kerr black hole, has been confirmed also in the case of the HBHs considered here, where they
appear with a much richer phenomenology. This is because BHL accretion onto HBHs leads
to the formation of a number of resonant cavities, namely: in the upstream bow-shock and,
for weak scalar fields, in the downstream shock-cone, but also between the stagnation point
and the event horizon, and between the stagnation point and the position of the maximum of
the scalar field amplitude. We have computed such frequencies and have compared them with
the QPOs observed in the X-ray light curve of Sgr A* and three microquasars. Although the
results of this comparison are not conclusive, possibly because the galactic centre is a highly
complex and dynamical system with extremely low accretion rates and with inflow geometries
thatarenotnecessarilythoseofclassicaldiscaccretion, wearguethatfurtherworkalongthese
lines and the measurement of QPOs in other supermassive black holes might help establish a
possible observational fingerprint for ultralight scalar field dark matter.
In summary, the results presented here provide a first quantitative description of the
BHL gas dynamics past HBHs, where the gravitational field is produced by the combined
presence of a black hole and a scalar hair. In an astrophysical context, this study can help
associate specific features in the evolution of the gas to different system components, i.e.,
eithertheblackhole, thescalarfield, orthecombinationofthetwothroughtheirgravitational
interaction.
