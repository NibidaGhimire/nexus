Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interference is a compelling quantum phenomenon that demonstrates
the nonclassical nature of single photons. In this study, we investigate an electromagnetically induced
transparency-based double-Λ four-wave mixing system from the perspective of quantized light fields.
The system can be used to realize efficient HOM interference in the frequency domain. By using
the reduced density operator theory, we demonstrate that although the double-Λ medium does
not exhibit phase-dependent properties for the closed-loop case of two incident single photons,
frequency-domain HOM two-photon interference occurs. For experimentally achievable optical depth
conditions, our theory indicates that this double-Λ scheme can perform high-fidelity Hadamard
gate operations on frequency-encoded single-photon qubits, and thereby generate HOM two-photon
NOON states with a fidelity greater than 0.99. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this scheme can
be used to realize arbitrary single-qubit gates and two-qubit SWAP gates by simply controlling the
laser detuning and phase, exhibiting its multifunctional properties and providing a new route to
scalable optical quantum computing.
I. INTRODUCTION
Hong–Ou–Mandel (HOM) interference [1–3], a well-
known quantum effect without a classical counterpart,
has played a key role in optical quantum information
processing [4–7] and quantum metrology [8–11]. Instead
of passive devices, such as spatial or polarizing beam
splitters, recent studies have used frequency converters
to transfer HOM interference from the spatial to the
spectral domain; this method facilitates quantum fre-
quency multiplexing and engineering [12–15]. Studies
of frequency-domain HOM interference for single pho-
tons have relied on linear optics, which involve the use of
electro-optic phase modulators [16–19], or the nonlinear
effects of solid materials [20–23]. Both schemes oper-
ate under far-detuned interaction conditions, thus typi-
cally requiring the use of high-voltage amplifiers or strong
pump light, which leads to the generation of adjacent
sidebands or parametric noise photons. Herein, we pro-
pose another promising scheme based on near-resonant
nonlinear optics that enables frequency-domain HOM
interference with high visibility. The proposed scheme
leverages the closed-loop four-wave mixing (FWM) effect
in a double-Λ electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) system [24]. Because of the EIT effect, this near-
resonant FWM scheme can substantially suppress vac-
uum field noise at low light levels, thereby effectively pre-
venting photon dissipation and avoiding the generation of
noise photons [25]. Such properties enable this double-Λ
scheme to generate frequency-domain HOM two-photon
NOON states with extremely high fidelity.
To study frequency-domain HOM interference in a
closed-loop double-Λ medium, we constructed a quan-
∗yfchen@mail.ncku.edu.twtum model based on the reduced density operator the-
ory [26]. Unlike semiclassical approaches, the proposed
model quantizes two incident weak light fields. No dis-
cussion of such closed-loop FWM systems from the per-
spective of quantized light fields was found in a literature
review. Previous semiclassical models have demonstrated
that the respective transmittances of the two incident
light fields through a closed-loop double-Λ medium are
affected by the relative phases of the applied light fields;
this is known as the phase-dependent property [27–29].
However, our quantum model revealed that the phase-
dependent property of a closed-loop double-Λ medium
depends on the quantum states of the two incident weak
light fields. If both incident weak light fields are in
coherent states, the double-Λ medium exhibits phase-
dependent properties, which is consistent with the pre-
dictions of a semiclassical model and has been exper-
imentally confirmed [30–32]. By contrast, if both in-
cident weak light fields are single photons, this phase-
dependent property is no longer present. Although the
double-Λ medium does not have phase-dependent proper-
ties in the case of two incident single photons, frequency-
domain HOM interference of the two-photon state oc-
curs. Our theory shows that such a double-Λ scheme
can perform high-fidelity Hadamard gate operations on
frequency-encoded single-photon qubits. For experimen-
tally achievable optical depth (OD) conditions, HOM
two-photon NOON states with a fidelity of 0.99 can
be generated. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the
first time that this scheme can be used to implement
arbitrary single-qubit gates and high-fidelity two-qubit
SWAP gates, revealing its advantages in fabricating mul-
tifunctional photonic logic gates.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces
the model of the double-Λ EIT system, which incorpo-
rates quantized weak input fields. The quantum statesarXiv:2302.06888v2  [quant-ph]  1 Jun 20232
of the output fields are derived using the reduced density
operator theory. In Sec. III, we explore the input state
consisting of two coherent fields and compare the results
with the semiclassical model. Section IV investigates the
utilization of a single-photon qubit and discusses the con-
ditions for implementing the color Hadamard gate within
the current system. The conditions for frequency-domain
HOM interference with two input single photons are dis-
cussed in Sec. V. Furthermore, Sec. VI proposes and
demonstrates the capability of the double-Λ EIT system
to generate two-qubit SWAP gates. Finally, the conclu-
sions are presented in Sec. VII.
II. THEORETICAL MODEL
We consider a medium comprising double-Λ four-level
atoms with two metastable ground states and two ex-
cited states [Fig. 1(a)]. The weak probe field ˆ apdriv-
ing the |1⟩ ↔ | 3⟩transition and the weak signal field
ˆasdriving the |1⟩ ↔ | 4⟩transition can both be de-
scribed by quantum operators obeying the bosonic com-
mutation relation. High-intensity coherent coupling and
driving fields, described by the semiclassical Rabi fre-
quency Ω c(d)=|Ωc(d)|eiϕc(d)with a well-defined phase
ϕc(d), drive |2⟩ ↔ | 3⟩and|2⟩ ↔ | 4⟩transitions, respec-
tively, forming a closed-loop double-Λ EIT system to-
gether with the probe and signal fields. The parameters
γ31andγ41represent the total coherence decay rates of
the excited states |3⟩and|4⟩, respectively. γ21is the de-
phasing rate between the ground states |1⟩and|2⟩. We
consider the case in which the signal field and the driv-
ing field satisfy the two-photon resonance condition, but
a one-photon detuning, denoted as ∆, exists. By using
the collective atomic operator approach and ignoring in-
teractions between atoms, the interaction Hamiltonian ˆH
of the double-Λ system can be expressed as follows:

All light fields are assumed to propagate in the same direc-

Both the input probe and signal fields are in coherent states.
In this case, the two coherent fields |βp⟩and |βs⟩interfere
in the double-Λ medium, and the output of the two coherent
fields depends on the relative phase of the applied light fields.
(c) Input probe and signal fields are two single photons (i.e.,
|1p1s⟩). In this case, although the phase-dependent property
of the double-Λ medium is no longer present, HOM interfer-
ence of the two-photon state occurs. The frequency-domain
two-photon NOON state can be generated simply by optimiz-
ing the OD and ∆.

system, the probe and signal fields can be considered
as perturbation fields due to their significantly weaker
strengths compared to the coupling and driving fields.
Therefore, we can solve the first-order atomic operators
by substituting the zero-order perturbation results into
the relevant first-order HLEs as follows:

In Eq. (10), AandC(DandB) represent the mode-
preserved and mode-converted coefficients, respectively,
of the probe (signal) field propagating in the double-Λ
medium. These coefficients are similar to the transmis-
sion and reflection coefficients of light passing through a
spatial beam splitter.
To investigate the response of the double-Λ medium to
different input photon quantum states, the density ma-
trix of the output state, ρf=˜Uρi˜U†, is constructed in
accordance with the density matrix of the input state ρi
and the evolution operator ˜Uof the combined system in
the frequency domain, where ρi=ρPS(z= 0, ω)⊗ρR
is in the product form of the incident probe and signal
fields ρPSand the reservoir ρR. According to the re-
duced density operator approach employed in our previ-
ous works [25, 35], under the steady-state condition, the
matrix element of the output probe and signal fields in
the Fock-state basis can be expressed as:
ρPS

˜ρmpmsnpns(L,0)ρi	
, (16)
where ˜ ρmpmsnpns(L,0) = ˜U†(|npns⟩⟨mpms| ⊗IR)˜Uis
the operator for the matrix element of the output probe
and signal fields. If Eq. (10) is applied and the vacuum
density matrix with annihilation and creation operators
are rewritten as |0⟩⟨0|=P∞

where χmnl=1 √

of Eq. (17), the normal-ordered noise caused by the
Langevin operator ˜fjkis proportional to the atomic pop-
ulation of the excited state [37]; hence, it can be ignored
under the perturbation condition of the weak probe and
signal fields (see Appendix B for more details).
III. TWO COHERENT FIELDS
We first consider the case of two coherent fields passing
through the double-Λ medium. As indicated in Fig. 1(b),4
the two coherent states with probe and signal frequency
modes, respectively, are the initial states |ψPS
i⟩=|βp⟩ ⊗
|βs⟩. If Eqs. (16) and (17) are calculated, the matrix
element of the the output probe and signal fields can be
obtained as

becomes

where both the output probe |β′

remain in coherent states, indicating that the double-Λ
medium only coherently redistributes the incident probe
and signal amplitudes through the EIT-based FWM pro-
cess without changing the photon statistics of these two
coherent fields or entangling them [38]. This makes the
case of two coherent fields unable to produce HOM two-
photon interference. Furthermore, Eq. (19) reveals that
the amplitude and phase changes of the output probe and
signal fields depend on the relative phase of the applied
light fields. The transmittances and phase shifts of the
probe and signal fields through the double-Λ medium are
given by

curves of transmittance and phase shift, as a function
of the relative phase ϕrfor the probe and signal fields
obtained from the current quantum model (solid lines),
are identical to those of the semiclassical model (dotted
lines) in Ref. [30]. If the input light fields are all in co-
herent states, this closed-loop double-Λ medium exhibits

phase-dependent properties, which have been experimen-
tally investigated in atomic ensembles [30–32].
IV. HADAMARD GATES
We next consider a single-photon qubit case in which
an incident single photon has entangled probe and signal
frequency modes, namely
|ψPS
i⟩=1√
1 +u2 
|1p0s⟩+ue−iϕu|0p1s⟩
,(24)
where uis a parameter indicating the amplitude ratio
between the probe and signal frequency modes, and ϕu
denotes the relative phase between the two modes. A
single photon with a superposition state of two frequency
modes is also called a frequency-encoded photonic qubit
or two-color qubit [39]. Here, ϕuis similar to the role
of the relative phase ( ϕp−ϕs) between the two coherent
fields mentioned in the previous section. Therefore, in
the case of a single-photon two-color qubit, the double-Λ
medium can also be expected to exhibit phase-dependent
properties. To confirm this, the probability that the out-
put single photon is in the probe and signal frequency
modes, respectively, can be determined using Eqs. (16)
and (17) as follows:
P1p0s=ρPS

where ϕr=ϕu−(ϕc−ϕd) is equivalent to the relative
phase in the previous case of two coherent fields with
ϕu=ϕp−ϕs. As expected, these results verify the depen-
dence of the output state of the single-photon qubit on
the relative phase of the applied light fields in the double-
Λ medium. Figure 3(a) plots the theoretical curves of
P1p0sandP0p1sas a function of OD under the conditions

increases as OD increases and reaches a maximum value
close to 1 at OD = 200, whereas P0p1sdecreases to al-
most zero. In other words, under these conditions, the
two-color single photon entering the double-Λ medium is
converted into a single photon carrying only one color,
which is equivalent to the Hadamard gate, and its oper-
ation fidelity can reach 0.99 at OD = 200.
The physical mechanism behind this frequency-domain
Hadamard gate can be described as follows. Because
of the large detuning condition of ∆ = (OD /π) Γ, the
amplitudes of the mode-preserved coefficient and mode-
converted coefficient of the double-Λ medium are almost
equal; that is, |A| ≈ |C| ≈0.5 and |D| ≈ |B| ≈0.5 [Eqs.
(12)–(15)]. In this case, when ϕr=π/2, the probe mode-
preserved coefficient A∗and the signal mode-converted
coefficient B′∗e−iπ/2in Eq. (25) are almost in phase,
resulting in constructive interference, which causes the
output photon to be converted into the probe frequency
mode (i.e., P1p0s≈1). However, if ϕris 3π/2, the two
aforementioned coefficients have out-of-phase destructive
interference, causing the theoretical curves in Fig. 3(a) to
become interchanged, and the output photon is converted
to the signal frequency mode, resulting in P0p1s≈1. In
addition, it is worth noting that under the condition of
a sufficiently large OD and the specific detuning men-
tioned above, we can derive the unitary matrix of the
gate operation using Eqs. (12)–(15). By introducing a π
phase plate at the output of the signal field, the derived
unitary matrix can be transformed into the unitary ma-
trix representation of the Hadamard gate. Such results
also indicate that the current scheme is applicable to any
input state of a single-photon qubit.
For the input single-photon qubits with arbitrary u
values, the output of |1p0s⟩can be achieved by using a
specific detuning value ∆ that satisfies the |A∗|=|uB′∗|
condition. In this case, constructive interference in the
probe frequency mode occurs if ϕr=π/2. By contrast,
the output of |0p1s⟩can be achieved by simply settingthe relative phase ϕrto 3π/2 and adjusting ∆ to sat-
isfy the condition |C′∗|=|uD∗|. This suggests that the
double-Λ scheme can be used as a single-qubit gate with
x-rotation and y-rotation. Therefore, arbitrary single-
qubit gates can be realized by concatenating the x- and
y-rotation gates based on this scheme [40]. Figure 3(b)
presents plots of two theoretical curves of ∆ as a func-
tion of urequired to achieve the maximum probabilities
of|1p0s⟩and|0p1s⟩for OD = 200. The two curves in-
tersect at u= 1 and ∆ = (200 /π)Γ, corresponding to
the condition OD = 200 of Fig. 3(a). For one-color input
single photons ( u= 0), the double-Λ medium does not
have phase-dependent properties because no interference
occurs [Eqs. (25) and (26)]. This system is also known
as an open-loop FWM system and can be used as an
efficient frequency converter [41–45].
V. HOM INTERFERENCE
We now consider the case in which the two input single
photons carry the probe and signal frequency modes, re-
spectively. This is a two-photon state with no correlation
between the modes, as depicted by |1p⟩⊗|1s⟩in Fig. 1(c).
As previously stated, under the ideal conditions of an
extremely large OD value, the double-Λ medium causes
little photon dissipation. Therefore, the output photons
only have the following three possible quantum states
with corresponding probabilities: (1) state |2p0s⟩, both
photons exit under the probe frequency mode with P2p0s;
(2) state |0p2s⟩, both photons exit under the signal fre-
quency mode with P0p2s; (3) state |1p1s⟩, photons exit
with disparate colors with P1p1s. These three probabili-
ties are obtained as

Unlike the previous case of the input two-color qubit, the
probabilities of the output states in this case are not af-
fected by the relative phase of the applied light fields;
they are phase-independent. This phenomenon is as-
cribed to the quantum uncertainty of the relative phase
between the two input single photons, which prevents
them from interfering with each other in the double-Λ
medium. However, quantum interference of the two-
photon state occurs [Eqs. (27)–(29)].
Figure 4(a) presents plots of the probabilities P2p0s,
P0p2s, and P1p1sversus ∆ at OD = 200. These theo-
retical curves reveal that if ∆ = (200 /π)Γ, both P2p0s
andP0p2sare close to 0.5, whereas P1p1sapproaches 0.
That is, the input two-photon state |1p1s⟩is almost com-
pletely suppressed by the double-Λ medium, and the two
single photons tend to have the same color, exhibiting
HOM interference in the frequency domain. This phe-
nomenon of two-photon state interference is caused by
the operation of the Hadamard gate. If ∆ = (OD /π)Γ,6

the magnitudes of the coefficients for mode preservation
and mode conversion are almost equal (approximately
0.5), which is the Hadamard gate operation and causes
the transition amplitudes A∗D∗(describing the two pho-
tons preserved in their respective modes) and B∗C∗(in-
dicating that the modes of the two photons mutually
swap) to have the same magnitude but be out of phase
(i.e., A∗D∗≈ −B∗C∗). Therefore, destructive interfer-
ence between the two transition amplitudes in Eq. (29)
occurs, resulting in P1p1s≈0.
When the laser is detuned as (100 /π)Γ in Fig. 4(a),
the two single photons exit with disparate colors; the
state is |1p1s⟩. In contrast with the two-photon HOM
interference produced in the Hadamard gate operation,
the mode-converted coefficients B∗andC∗are both ap-
proximately 1 in this case, whereas the mode-preserved
coefficients A∗andD∗approach 0, resulting in P1p1s≈1
andP2p0s≈P0p2s≈0. Thus, the two single photons
mutually swap colors in a near-perfect frequency conver-
sion process and end up in the same state |1p1s⟩, which
also shows that whether the output photons generate
HOM interference or swap colors can be controlled in this
double-Λ scheme by simply adjusting the laser detuning
conditions.
Figure 4(b) plots the theoretical curves of P2p0sand
P0p2sversus OD under the HOM interference condition
of ∆ = (OD /π) Γ. The theoretical results indicate that
increasing OD can suppress the loss of output photons
due to spontaneous emission. Therefore, if the OD value
is large, the loss of output photons can be neglected, and

, (30)
which is a two-photon NOON state in the frequency do-
main that has practical applications in photonic quan-
tum metrology for its ability to conduct precision phase
measurements if used in optical interferometers [46]. Al-
though the amplitude of the two-photon NOON state is
independent of the phases of the applied light fields, the
relative phase between modes |2p0s⟩and|0p2s⟩can be
controlled by varying ϕcandϕd. Furthermore, for actual
cases of finite OD, the two input single photons in the
double-Λ medium will be slightly dissipated, which not
only causes the output photons to become a mixed state
but also reduces the fidelity of the two-photon NOON
state, as displayed in Fig. 4(c). The theoretical curve
reveals that the fidelity approaches 1 as the OD in-
creases owing to the proportional suppression of photon
loss due to spontaneous emission in the double-Λ EIT
medium. If OD = 500, the fidelity can reach 0.99, which
is a condition that can currently be achieved experimen-
tally [47–49]. Hence, HOM interference based on the
double-Λ scheme is applicable for generating high-purity
two-photon NOON states in the frequency domain.
VI. SWAP GATES
In the previous section, we have shown that when
the condition ∆ = (OD /2π) Γ is satisfied, the colors of
two input single photons are exchanged in the double-Λ
medium [see Fig. 4(a)]. Next, we demonstrate that this
double-Λ scheme can be used as a high-fidelity two-qubit
SWAP gate under this condition, which is essential for
scalable quantum networks [50, 51]. Figure 5(a) presents
the average (curve) and standard deviation (gray area)7
of the SWAP gate fidelity according to the four computa-
tional input states (i.e., |0p0s⟩,|1p0s⟩,|0p1s⟩, and|1p1s⟩)
versus OD. The theoretical curve shows that the average
fidelity approaches 1 as the OD increases. By contrast,
the standard deviation of fidelity decreases with increas-
ing OD. When OD = 500, the fidelity of the SWAP gate
can reach 0 .98. For the region of OD exceeding 1000, the
SWAP gate achieves a high fidelity of F= 0.99 with a
low standard deviation of 0 .01. The truth table of the
SWAP process when OD = 1000 is shown in Fig. 5(b).
Under this condition, the average success probability per
gate operation reaches 0 .98, corresponding to an error
rate of 0 .02 for a single SWAP operation.
VII. CONCLUSION
We have investigated a novel double-Λ FWM system
based on EIT for achieving efficient HOM interference in
the frequency domain. Our study from the perspective of
quantized light fields has provided a deeper understand-
ing of the quantum properties of the double-Λ medium.
Our findings indicate that this scheme can perform
high-fidelity Hadamard gate operations on frequency-
encoded single-photon qubits and generate HOM two-
photon NOON states with a fidelity greater than 0.99 at
OD = 500. The proposed scheme offers high visibility
and practical applications in photonic quantum metrol-
ogy. Moreover, we have shown that the scheme can be
used to realize arbitrary single-qubit gates and two-qubit
SWAP gates by controlling the laser detuning and phase,
which highlights its multifunctional properties. These
photonic gates can be easily integrated with various EIT-
related quantum technologies, such as quantum mem-
ories [52–57] and quantum repeaters [58–64], enabling
the development of quantum networks and scalable quan-
tum information processing [65–69]. Overall, our results
demonstrate that the proposed double-Λ FWM system
is a promising platform for frequency-domain HOM in-
terference with high fidelity and multifunctional capa-
bilities. Further experimental investigations and appli-
cations of this scheme in various quantum information
processing tasks are warranted.

APPENDIX B: NOISE CORRELATIONS AND
DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS
In the derivation of Eq. (17), we assume that the
Langevin noise operator satisfies the delta correlation as
follows:
⟨˜fjk(z, ω)˜fk′j′(z′, ω′)⟩=L
2πcDjk,k′j′δ(z−z′)δ(ω−ω′),
(B1)
where Djk,k′j′is the diffusion coefficient, which can be
obtained using the Einstein relation [70] as follows:
Djk,k′j′=∂

∂tˆσjk−ˆFjk
ˆσk′j′
−
ˆσjk∂

. (B2)
For the case of γ21= 0 considered in the main text, we
can obtain the diffusion coefficient of the double-Λ atomic
system through Eq. (B2). Its matrix form is
Djk,k′j′=

Under the condition of the weak probe and signal fields,
⟨ˆσ33⟩ ≈ ⟨ ˆσ44⟩ ≈0, that is, all the normal-ordered noise
correlations ⟨˜fjk˜fk′j′⟩are close to zero. According to
Eq. (10), the normal-ordered noise correlations con-
tribute additional photons to the probe and signal fields,
i.e.⟨˜a†
p,L˜ap,L⟩and⟨˜a†
s,L˜as,L⟩, which can be regarded as
the spontaneous-emitted noise photons induced by the
vacuum field reservoir. Additionally, we calculate the
anti-normal-ordered noise terms, ⟨˜fk′j′˜fjk⟩. Under the
same conditions, the corresponding diffusion coefficient
matrix is
Dk′j′,jk=

Unlike the normal-ordered noise terms, Eq. (B4) indi-
cates that the anti-normal-ordered noise correlations in
this double-Λ system do not disappear even in the case
of weak probe and signal fields. In Appendix C, we will
show that the anti-normal-ordered noise terms lead to
the dissipation of the incident light fields.
APPENDIX C: COMMUTATION RELATIONS OF
FIELD OPERATORS
The frequency-domain commutation relation of the
creation and annihilation operators for the probe field
can be expressed as

˜ap(z, ω),˜a†
p(z, ω′)

2πcδ(ω−ω′). (C1)
We use Eq. (10) in Sec. II to calculate the communica-
tion relation of the probe field propagating through thedouble-Λ atomic medium as follows:
⟨˜a†
p,L˜ap,L⟩=|A∗|2⟨˜a†

Substituting Eqs. (C2) and (C3) into Eq. (C1), and
combining the results of Eqs. (B3) and (B4), the expec-
tation value of the commutator of the output probe field
is derived as

ZL
0(P∗
31D1331P31+P∗
41D1441P41)dz
= 1− |A∗|2− |B∗|2. (C5)
The left-hand side of Eq. (C5) comes from the contribu-
tion of anti-normal-ordered noise correlations. This indi-
cates that once the output probe field is dissipated, i.e.
|A∗|2+|B∗|2<1, it must be caused by the anti-normal-
ordered noise correlations. However, for a double-Λ
medium with a sufficiently large OD, |A∗|2+|B∗|2≈1,
that is, the contribution of anti-normal-ordered noise
terms approaches to zero, indicating that the vacuum
field reservoir is unable to disturb the lossless system
through quantum fluctuations. Additionally, the formula
for the output signal field has also been derived as fol-
lows:
