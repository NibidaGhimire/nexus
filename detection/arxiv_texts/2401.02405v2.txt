Time-dependent gravitational background is well known as a theoretical laboratory for quan-
tum mechanical particle production. In the present analysis, we explore such production in a
time-dependent analog system. This is the follow-up of our earlier study on the Sonoluminescence
phenomenon, which is modelled in terms of analog geometry coupled with the electromagnetic field
exhibiting the quantum production of photons. In the same analog geometry, we studied fermion
production. Although fermions have not been observed yet in the sonoluminescence experiment,
we have shown here that such a system can produce a repeated flux of fermions via the parametric
resonance from a quantum vacuum. Our analysis seems to suggest that in the laboratory setup,
time-dependent analog systems could be an interesting playground where phenomena of quantum
mechanical particle production can be observed.
I. INTRODUCTION
Can fermions be produced from analog system? To re-
alize such a scenario, we take the reader through an inter-
esting and experimentally observed phenomenon called
Sonoluminescence (for review one may look at [1, 2]), in
which photons are produced by a yet unknown mecha-
nism. The system consists of a quasi-periodically oscil-
lating gas bubble in a liquid excited by sound waves [3].
During its oscillation, the bubble emits flashes of light
periodically [4–7]. There are two competing proposals
for the mechanism of such fascinating phenomena. The
classical one attributes it to the well known thermal Be-
misterlang processes from the high-temperature gas in-
side the bubble that is assumed to be partially charged
[1, 8, 9]. And the quantum mechanical one attributes
it to the fact that flashes are produced from the quan-
tum vacuum, where the quantum photon field is coupled
with the gas inside the oscillating bubble that is mod-
elled in terms of time-varying dielectric constant [10–22].
All the proposed models have some success with their
merits and demerits. For details see the review [2]. We
will be particularly interested in the quantum mechanical
modelling of such phenomena. However, it is important
to note that all the existing quantum mechanical mecha-
nisms suffer from ultraviolet divergences [23–26], and an
ad hoc cut-off is being used to accommodate the experi-
mental observation.
In our earlier paper [27], we have proposed a new non-
perturbative mechanism, that has been shown to have
the potential to explain such phenomena which does not
suffer from any ultraviolet divergences. Thanks to the
analog gravity interpretation of a fluid system, where dy-
namics of the perturbation modes can be described on
an analog gravity background [28]. And in the context
of sonoluminescence, we modelled the oscillating bubble
∗rajesh018@iitg.ac.in
†debu@iitg.ac.inin terms of an oscillating analog geometry and proposed
a coupling prescription of the electromagnetic perturba-
tion with the geometry. With the proposed coupling we
indeed showed that flashes of photon are produced from
quantum vacuum through parametric resonance. The ge-
ometric approach of our proposed mechanism is universal
in nature.
The universality of particle production in a time-
dependent background motivates us to extend our previ-
ous proposal of sonoluminescence into the fermion sector
and show that along with the flashes of light, such oscil-
lating bubbles may also produce flashes of fermions from
quantum vacuum again via parametric resonance. Since
the produced fermions are very light, those fermions
might also be identified as neutrinos. Neutrinos are fee-
bly interacting particles with definite chirality, and take
part in weak interaction in standard model of particle
physics. Neutrino oscillation experiments suggest [29, 30]
that they are massive with the highest mass being as
high as 0 .5 eV [31, 32], taking into account all the fla-
vors. However, there is no experimental bound on the
lowest possible neutrino mass. In our analysis, we, there-
fore, assume the mass of the fermion as a free parameter,
however small. There are several scenarios where fermion
production has been investigated, specifically in the con-
text of early universe cosmology, in time-dependent back-
ground [33–42]. However, the possibility of producing
fermions in the analog system is not intuitively obvi-
ous, and precisely this is the phenomenon we wish to
explore. We call this phenomenon Sonofermionescence ,
which may possibly be observed in the existing sonolu-
minescence experiment in the near future. This can be
thought of as an analog cosmological laboratory.
We have organized the paper in the following man-
ner. In Sec.II, we begin with a brief discussion about
the dynamics of the bubble in fluid and possible exper-
imental setup for the Sonofermionescence event. This
section also serves to illustrate the construction of the
analog-acoustic metric in terms of the radial dynamics
of the bubble. Next, in Sec.III we formulate the gov-
erning equations of the minimally coupled fermion fieldarXiv:2401.02405v2  [hep-th]  22 Sep 20242
in the time-dependent background and follow the neces-
sary steps for the canonical quantization of the classical
fermion field. In Sec.IV we define the suitable observ-
able quantity, fermion number spectrum, for the experi-
mental measurement, followed by the fermion energy flux
in Sec.V, and we demonstrate the corresponding results
obtained using numerical computation. Finally, we con-
clude with possible future scenarios.
Note that we will use the metric signature as
(−,+,+,+) and follow the natural units, ℏ=c=G= 1,
throughout the discussion. Also, Latin alphabets are
used for the flat space time indices, while Greek alpha-
bets are utilized to denote the curved space time indices.
II. SONOLUMINESCENCE BUBBLE AND
ANALOG GEOMETRY
It has been experimentally observed [3–7] that an oscil-
lating air bubble under the influence of the sound wave
emits repeated flashes of light. Detailed experimental
setup and its observational findings can be found in [1, 2].
Following a similar strategy, we have proposed here the
possible experimental setup, illustrated in Fig.2, for the
observation of Sonofermionescence. Driven by the exter-
nal sound wave, an air bubble located inside water under-
goes rapid oscillation, and its dynamics is described by
the well known Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) equation [8, 43, 44]

Where R(t) denotes the bubble radius and the dot rep-
resents the time derivative. In the above equation, the
value of the physical parameters, which have been ex-
perimentally used [1], are as follows: speed of sound
in water, cs= 1481 m/sec, the ambient (also called
equilibrium) pressure Peq= 1 atm at the ambient ra-
dius of the bubble, Req= 4.5µm, the shear viscosity
of the fluid, η= 0.003 Kg /(m−sec), coefficient of the
surface tension, σ= 0.03 Kg /sec2, the density of the
fluid, ρ∼1000 Kg /m3, pressure-amplitude of the acous-
tic drive, Pa= 1.35 atm, frequency of the acoustic drive,
ωa= 2π(26.5) kHz. For air bubbles in water, van der
Waals hard core radius is assumed to be a= 0.5µm.
Now, to find out the evolution of the bubble radius, we
numerically solve the RP equation considering the ini-
tial conditions as R(t= 0) = 4 .5µm and ˙R(t= 0) = 0.

FIG. 1. Dynamics of the oscillating bubble is presented in
terms of the temporal profile of the bubble surface. One can
see that the RP equation correctly provides for the evolution
of the bubble, which undergoes a repeated quasiperiodic os-
cillation. We have specifically shown a full period starting
from t= 20µs tot= 60µs. However, the initial fluctuations
will essentially be subtracted, as we will see in the subsequent
sections.
In our recent paper [27] we have modelled this dynami-
cal bubble in terms of effective analog geometry following
the prescription given in [28]. For the sake of complete-
ness, we will discuss the procedure to construct this effec-
tive analog metric, which is often referred to as the acous-
tic metric. We start with an incompressible and irro-
tational fluid, and the corresponding energy-momentum
tensor, Tµνsatisfies the following covariant conservation3
equation,
∇µTµν= 0, Tµν= (ρ+P)uµuν+Pηµν,(2)
where ρandPrespectively represent the density and
pressure of the fluid. ηµνsymbolizes the Minkowski met-
ric depicting the flat space time. Whereas, uµ≡(1,v)
denotes the four-velocity of the fluid. In his renowned
paper [28], Unruh proposed the conjecture that the be-
haviour of sound waves in an incompressible fluid resem-
bles the governing equation of a classical field propagat-
ing in a gravitational background. Therefore to construct
the metric one is required to derive the fluctuation equa-
tion first. For this purpose, the conservation equation
above shall be represented by three coupled equations,
∇×v= 0,
ρ∂v
∂t+ (v·∇)v
=−∇p−ρ∇Φ,
∂ρ
∂t+∇·(ρv) = 0 .(3)
The first equation in the above set denotes the irrota-
tional property of the fluid, which leads us to repre-
sent the velocity as the gradient of a velocity poten-
tial,v=∇ψ. The following equations embody the Eu-
ler equation and the continuity equation, respectively.
Within the Euler equation, the right-hand side indicates
that the force within the medium arises from both pres-
sure and an external driving force, quantified as the gra-
dient of a potential, Φ. To simplify our task we introduce
the following parameterization as given in [28],
g(ζ) =Zeζ1
ρ′dp(ρ′)
dρ′dρ′, (4)
where, ζ≡logρ. Utilizing the above quantity, the set of
fluid equations (3) simplify to
∂ψ
∂t+1
2v·v+g(ζ) + Φ = 0 , (5)
and
∂ζ
∂t+v·∇ζ+∇·v= 0. (6)
Now, one can introduce fluctuation in the medium via
the fluid parameters, as follows,
ζ=ζ0+¯ζ, ψ →ψ0+¯ψ, (7)
where ζ0andψ0represent some background solutions.
Then, the governing equation of the fluctuation, ¯ψturns
out as [45, 46],

0, with c0representing the local velocity of sound waves
within the medium. For instance, in air, c0∼343m /s.
Unruh proposed [28] that the above characteristic equa-
tion (8) of sound wave fluctuation within a fluid resem-
bles the propagation of a field in a spacetime background
possessing an effective acoustic metric (AM), which can
be expressed as,

where, we have introduced ˜ ρ0to ensure that the dimen-
sion of dsAMcorresponds to length. This new parameter
can also be considered as a tuning parameter to be ad-
justed according to the observed results. Important to
note that this overall factor results in the same fluctua-
tion equation as (8). Whereas xirepresents the spatial
coordinates and vi
0denotes the components of the local
velocity of the fluid in the direction of along xi. Now, we
are left with the evaluation of two primary fluid parame-
ters: the background velocity, denoted as v0=q

and the background fluid density, represented by ρ0. As-
suming the spherically symmetric nature of the bubble
oscillation, the velocity of the fluid inside the bubble, v0
will be considered as radial and can approximately be
taken as [8],
v0=˙R
Rr, (10)
which satisfies the physical boundary conditions v0(r=
0) = 0 and v0(r=R) = ˙R. Let us now consider the
continuity equation for an incompressible fluid flow [45],
∂ρ0
∂t+ρ0
r2∂(r2v0)
∂r= 0, (11)
Substituting the expression v0, one can derive the fluid
density as,

eq
R3(t), (12)
where the equilibrium fluid density is represented as
ρeq=ρ0(t→t0), i.e. fluid density at the ambient ra-
dius of the bubble, Req=R(t→t0). Nevertheless, with
the arbitrary parameter ˜ ρ0, we recast the expression of
the term involving fluid density in front of the metric (9)
as˜ρ−1

R(t)3, where a new arbitrary parameter, ξis
introduced that incorporates all the constant parameters,
such as ρeqandReq. Note that, ξhas the dimension of
length. The value of this parameter must be fixed by the
observation.4
In accordance with our earlier proposal [27] on photon
production, we put forward the same conjecture for the
fermion field, which perceives the acoustic metric as a
fluctuation to the flat space time geometry. Therefore
the total effective acoustic metric can be written as,

(13)
Where we have utilized the natural unit, c= 1, which
will be followed in the remaining part of this paper un-
less otherwise specified. The metric described above ef-
fectively characterizes the medium within the air filled
bubble. Hence, the parameter ϵ∼1 denotes the dielec-
tric constant of the air medium. We reexpress the above
metric in a compact form in the following way,
ds2=−f(t, r)dt2+ 2g(t, r)drdt+p(t) 

We further simplify this effective metric by diagonalizing
it with the transformation to the radial coordinate as,
d¯r
1/p1/6=√p dr+g√pdt, (16)
which can be integrated (for details of this derivation,
see Appendix.B of [27]) to obtain the scaling in the ra-
dial coordinate, ¯ r=rp1/3. Utilizing this rescaling, the
effective acoustic metric (14) boils down to,
ds2=−

For the subsequent analysis, we will exclude the tilde
symbol from the radial coordinate. Moreover, we will
consider the fluctuation (15) in the limit r→0 as done in
the case of photon production from the oscillating bubble
for the reason that the emission essentially happens as
the bubble comes to the minimum radius [27]. Therefore
the diagonal form of the metric becomes,
ds2=−f(t)dt2+p(t)1

with the metric components taking the following form:

section of the metric above can also be recast into Carte-
sian coordinates ( x, y, z ), and finally we obtain,
ds2=−f(t)dt2+p1/3(t) 
dx2+dy2+dz2
(20)
In the next section, we will delve into the discussion of
how this time-dependent effective acoustic metric, when
coupled with a fermion field, leads to the quantum pro-
duction of fermions. Note that in the computation of
the produced number spectrum and flux of fermions, we
have used ξ= (0.20,0.15,0.10)Reqwith the length scale
Req, which denotes the ambient radius of the bubble as
discussed previously. For this choice of the arbitrary pa-
rameter, the condition ( ξ/R)3<<1 is satisfied. There-
fore the fluctuation in the metric coefficients, p(t) and
f(t) (note that c0should be put in units of the light
speed, c= 3×108m/s) stays in the perturbative limit.
Interesting to note that the essential formalism quan-
titatively boils down to a conformally flat cosmological
model, where quantum particle production has been ex-
plored in detail in the literature [33–42]. For the present
case, therefore, we go to conformal coordinate, where the
above metric assumes the following form,
ds2=p(τ)1
3(−dτ2+dx2+dy2+dz2)),(21)
with conformal time dτ=dtp
f/p1/3. However, as men-
tioned before, having considered the fluctuation pertur-
batively, we treat the conformal time approximately as
a real time, τ≃t. Hence, the rest of the analyses have
been presented in real time coordinates.
III. FERMIONS IN ANALOG BACKGROUND:
A MINIMAL COUPLING PRESCRITION
We consider the following minimally coupled action of
a massive Dirac fermion ψ,
A=Z
d4x√−g¯ψ[iγµDµ−mψ]ψ, (22)
where mψis the mass of the fermion and g= det[ gµν],
with gµνrepresenting the effective acoustic metric (21).
Curved space time gamma matrices have been denoted
asγµ=eaµγa, where γarepresents the Flat space time
gamma matrices, which satisfy the usual anti commuta-
tion relation, {γa, γb}= 2ηabwith ηabas the Minkowski
metric. The connection to the curved-space gamma ma-
trices has been made through the Vierbein, which is
chosen as, eaµ≡p1/6(t)δaµ. Whereas the covariant
derivative can be expressed as, Dµ=∂µ+ Γµ, with
Γµ=1
4ωab
µγaγb[37, 38]. From this setup we obtain
γµΓµ=˙p(t)
4p7/6(t)γ0. The flat space gamma matrices, in
the Dirac representation, are given by,
γ0=
I0
0−I
, γi=

. (23)5
In terms of the rescaled field ψ(x) =p−1/4(t)χ(x), the
equation of motion governing the fermion field can be
derived from the action as,
iγa∂aχ−mψp1/6(t)χ= 0. (24)
Conjugate momentum of ψ, we derived from the action
as,
Πχ=∂(√−gL)
∂˙χ= i¯χγ0,Π¯χ= 0. (25)
Given the flat spatial structure of the background metric,
we decompose χ(x) into eigen spinors in the following

Given the following quantization condition,

one can show that spinor basis satisfies the following or-
thonormal relations [38],

utilizing the charge conjugation operator Vk,λ=Uc

λ(⃗k) =λζ−λ(⃗k). Using the
normalization of the modes we derive the following re-
lation between the time dependent function associated
with the spinors as
|fk(t)|2+|gk(t)|2= 1. (31)
Now to find out Uk,λ(t) and Vk,λ(t) we follow the ap-
proach of [38]. Substituting the mode decomposition in
(24) we obtain
i∂tfk(t)−λkgk(t)−mψp1/6(t)fk(t) = 0 ,
i∂tgk(t)−λkfk(t) +mψp1/6(t)gk(t) = 0 .(32)We decouple the equation to obtain the equation of mo-

(ωk(t) +p1/6(t)mψ)/2ωk(t),
that will provide for the required initial conditions,
fk(t)∼Nke−iωktand∂τfk(t)∼ −iNkωke−iωkt. With
this setup, we find out the solution of fk(t) from (33) nu-
merically in Mathematica with sufficient accuracy set by
the accuracy goal and precision goal. This solution will
be used to evaluate the observable quantities discussed
in the following section.
IV. FERMION NUMBER SPECTRUM
The Hamiltonian of the system can be obtained from
the action (22), and after some simplification can be ex-
pressed as [36, 40],

Fk(t) =−i(−fk(t)∂tgk(t) +gk(t)∂tfk(t)).
(35)
To diagonalize the above Hamiltonian we represent the
time-dependent creation and annihilation operators as
follows,
ˆbk,λ(t) =αk(t)ˆbk,λ+βk(t)ˆd†
−k,λ′,

−k,λ′,(36)
with the Bogoliubov coefficients, αk(t), βk(t) satisfying
the following constraint,
|αk|2+|βk|2= 1. (37)
Now the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (34) requires
that the coefficient of ˆd−k,λˆbk,λto be zero [36], and can
be quantitatively expressed as,
2Ek(t)β∗
k(t)αk(t) +Fk(t)α2
k(t)−F∗

k(t) = 0 ,(38)6
which leads to the following expression of the Bogoliubov
coefficient,
|βλ
k(t)|2=|Fk|2(t)
2ωk(t)(Ek(t) +ωk(t))=ωk(t)−Ek(t)
2ωk(t).
(39)
Note that we have used E2
k(t) +F2
k(t) =ω2
k(t) to derive
the last equality. Finally, substituting the expression of
Ek(t) from (35) in the above equation we formulate the
occupation number density |βλ

|βλ
k(t)|2=1
2+mψp1/6−2i(f∗
k∂tfk−fk∂tf∗

2ωk(t),(40)
We now analyze in detail the characteristics of the
fermion number spectrum |βλ
k(t)|2in terms of tuning
parameters ξand fermion mass, mψ. After numeri-
cally solving the Dirac equation (32), and substituting
the solution in (40), one will be able to evaluate the
number density of the fermion. We have plotted the
time evolution of the fermion number density |βλ
k(t)|2
in Fig.3 for a fixed wave number k= 0.33m−1and mass
mψ= 6.6×10−8eV of the fermion. From the plot, it
is clear that at the time when the bubble shrinks to its
minimum radius say t= 60 µs (see Fig.1), the sudden
jump in the fermion number density occurs, and such a
jump is repeated with the same time period as that of the
oscillating bubble. Therefore, the parametric resonance,
which is responsible for the photon flux as observed in the
experiment [3–5], also causes the production of flashes of
fermions and can in principle be detected. We further
plotted the number spectrum by taking the increment in
photon number density from t= 45µs tot= 55µs, which
shows a peak near around 1 m−1. We have been able to
obtain a stable solution within the range (0 .01,105) m−1
ofk, as shown in blue dotted points Fig.4. Further nu-
merical investigation is needed to extend that range to
a higher frequency. We should also mention that the
magnitude of the produced number density is small com-
pared to the maximum allowable value of |βk|2∼1 (37).
It will be interesting to consider explicit conformal break-
ing coupling as has been utilized for photon [27] and check
whether this magnitude could be enhanced. We save this
analysis as our future project. In the next section, we
define fermion energy flux that can also be experimen-
tally measured.
V. FERMION ENERGY FLUX

cally evaluate the above expression using (3), and plot-
ted in Fig.5 for three different values of the parameter
ξ= (0.20,0.15,0.10)Req, with the wave number k. In-
terestingly, one can see the increasing trend in the flux
with the wave number k. As expected, from the coupling
prescription with the background, increasing the value of
ξwill lead to more production, which is clearly visible
from Fig.5 in the low frequency range up to k∼100m−1.
However, in the high frequency range, generally, produc-
tion being very less (see fig.4) and frequency of the modes
playing the dominant role, we find it hard to distinguish
the effect of ξ. Now, recall that the proposed analog met-
ric (21) is conformally flat, hence the fermion mass plays
the primary role in realising the parametric resonance
as it is the mass term (24) which breaks the conformal
invariance. Therefore, we have further plotted the en-
ergy flux in Fig.6 for three different values of fermion
mass, mψ= (6 .6×10−10,6.6×10−8,6.6×10−6) eV.
This mass range could be very well suited for identify-
ing the fermions as neutrinos. Initially, the energy spec-
trum increases in magnitude as we increase the mass, and
then it saturates at around mψ∼10−6eV. Saturation
is more explicit in the high frequency range as the fre-
quency plays the dominant role in the effective potential
of the equation of motion (33) at a higher frequency. The
sudden jump of the bubble during moments of transition
to the minimum radius poses a challenge in obtaining the
numerical solution for heavier masses, which appears in
the equation of motion (33) as a multiplying factor with
the metric coefficients. Hence, a more advanced numer-
ical method (such as the methods discussed in [50, 51])
suitable to handle stiff ordinary differential equations is
required to present a better representation of the spec-
trum for heavier mass. Nevertheless, in the present anal-
ysis, we have mainly shown that the fermion can be pro-
duced periodically via parametric amplification [41]. To
our knowledge, this is the first case study of fermion pro-
duction in the context of analog fluid medium.

VI. CONCLUSION
In the time dependent background quantum particle
production is an intriguing phenomena which is the sub-
ject of investigation for a long time [33–42]. It has been
successfully applied in the early universe cosmological
scenario. It would indeed be interesting if such phe-
nomena could be observed in real laboratory systems.
Sonoluminescence is assumed to be one such phenomena
where quantum photon production is believed to be one
of the possible mechanisms. In our recent proposal [27]
we have revisited this issue and proposed a formalism in
the framework of analog geometric model. We further
emphasised that non-perturbative parametric resonance
plays a central role in explaining such phenomena.
The geometric framework is universal in nature which
motivates us to look into the possibility of fermion pro-
duction in such an analog model. In this article, we pro-
pose a minimal coupling prescription of the fermion field
with the analog oscillating bubble geometric. Along with
the flashes of photons, the fermion field is indeed ob-
served to experience parametric amplification due to the
oscillating bubble, and that produces flashes of fermion
from the quantum vacuum.
We have computed both the fermion number and en-
ergy density spectrum in the experimental unit. We
have obtained the flux in the low frequency region up
to∼105m−1. Interestingly the produced flux in terms of
frequency ( k) can be matched with the experimental re-
sults if it is observed. The smallness of the magnitude can
be attributed to the fact that we have restricted our anal-
ysis to purely minimal interaction with the background
acoustic metric. To enhance production, further explo-
ration with more explicit conformal breaking coupling
could be an interesting project for the future.
