Abstract: When large overdensities gravitationally collapse in the early universe, they
lead to primordial black holes (PBH). Depending on the exact model of ination leading
to necessary large perturbations at scales much smaller than scales probed at the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) surveys, PBHs of masses .103Mare formed sometime
between the end of ination and nucleosynthesis. However, the lack of a direct probe for
the exact expansion history of the universe in this duration introduces uncertainties in the
PBH formation process. The presence of alternate cosmological evolution for some duration
after ination aects the relation between (i) PBH mass and the scale of the collapsing
overdensity; and (ii) PBH abundance and amplitude of the overdensities. In this review,
the non-standard cosmological epochs relevant for a dierence in PBH production are
motivated and discussed. The importance of developing the framework of PBH formation
in non-standard epochs is discussed from a phenomenological point of view, with particular
emphasis on the advances in gravitational wave (GW) phenomenology, since abundant
PBHs are always accompanied by large induced GWs. PBH formation in general non-
standard epochs is also reviewed including the mathematical formalism. Specic examples,
such as PBH formation in a kinetic energy dominated epoch and an early matter dominated
epoch, are discussed with gures showing higher PBH abundances as compared to the
production in standard radiation domination.

1 Introduction
Primordial black holes (PBHs) have taken a seat at the forefront of contemporary research
in cosmology. PBHs are nonrelativistic and eectively collisionless, properties which make
them viable candidates for dark matter (DM) [1{5]. With the recent observations of binary
black hole systems by LIGO/Virgo surveys [6{12], there is a possibility that some of the
black holes observed are not astrophysical, but of primordial origin [13]. Since PBHs are
formed in the early universe, inspecting them phenomenologically can convey a better
understanding of the universe at very high energies. PBHs can have masses spanning over
a huge range from 1015gm to10M, where percent level contributions of PBH to the
{ 1 {total DM abundance are still not ruled out by observations [14]. Therefore, several types
of experiments can be used for constraining PBHs, ranging from galactic and extragalactic
-ray detectors relevant for light PBHs to lensing surveys and binary merger observations
for the heavy ones [14, 15].
In the context of early universe cosmology, understanding the reason and mechanism
for the production of PBHs is crucial [16{24]. PBHs can be formed due to dierent mecha-
nisms, such as the collapse of density perturbations which originate from single eld [25{37]
or multi-eld models [38{46] of ination, from bubble collisions [47{54], collapse of cosmic
strings [55{68] or domain walls [69{78] or scalar elds [79{82], etc. Each of these mecha-
nisms leads to a specic mass spectrum of the PBH produced, which leads to the relative
abundance of PBHs as DM, a quantity that can be checked with observational bounds.
In particular, PBH formation from the collapse of large overdensities is highly interest-
ing since these overdensities in the early universe can be linked to the primordial quantum
uctuations produced during ination [2, 3, 19, 22]. Scalar uctuations are produced at all
scales, which exit the horizon when the universe expands quasi-exponentially during ina-
tion. At the end of ination, these uctuations re-enter the horizon one by one, become
classical density uctuations and grow. If large overdensities are present, they can gravita-
tionally collapse with a certain probability and form PBHs. The superhorizon behaviour
of the uctuations depends on the model of ination, whereas their subhorizon growth in
the post-inationary epochs depends on the energy density driving that epoch. Therefore,
given a model of ination that can produce large scalar uctuations, the formation of PBH
depends on the dominant component for the energy density at the time of the collapse.
In the standard picture, at the end of ination, reheating takes place either instanta-
neously or slowly during which the universe becomes populated with relativistic degrees
of freedom (dof). At the end of reheating, these relativistic species start dominating the
energy density of the universe, thus marking the onset of radiation domination (RD). The
physics of reheating and preheating, although theoretically developed [83{87], cannot be
probed independently as these epochs are largely dependent on the model of ination. The
span in energy densities from the end of ination ( 1016GeV) and big bang nucleosynthe-
sis (BBN) ( TBBN5 MeV) is hugeO(1019), and is not accessible to direct observational
probes. The observed abundance of light elements requires the universe to be RD at least
by the time of BBN. Therefore, there is a certain possibility that the evolution in the
history of the universe deviated once or multiple times from this simple picture of RD in
this range.
Since the PBH formation process and the resulting abundance depend crucially on
the overdensity at the time of collapse as well as the evolution of relative energy density
of PBH and background, it is of immense importance to investigate the scenario when
PBH is formed in non-standard post-inationary epochs [88, 89]. There can be several
reasons which may give rise to such a non-standard evolution, e.g., prolonged reheating, a
heavy scalar eld that can dominate the energy density for some time and then reheat the
universe again, a sterile eld dominating the energy density, the kinetic energy of a scalar
eld dominating the energy budget, etc.. These various scenarios have been discussed in
detail in Section 3, and PBH formation has been analysed for a general non-standard epoch
{ 2 {and a few well-motivated examples in Sections 5.2 and 6.
In the realm of contemporary research on primordial cosmology, theoretical model
building for the early universe goes hand in hand with observational data. In this as-
pect, PBHs provide a uniquely interesting indirect probe towards the early universe at
high energy scales combining the details of inationary dynamics and the post-inationary
evolution of the universe. The collapse of large density perturbations originating from
inationary scalar uctuations is one of the most studied mechanisms to generate PBHs.
On one hand, the volume of literature is growing to realise models of ination with sin-
gle or multiple elds in simple or exquisite settings such as in the presence of a thermal
bath (warm ination), turns in the eld space (multi-eld ination), non-trivial gravita-
tional and derivative couplings, non-canonical kinetic terms, etc., which can predict CMB
consistent amplitude and spectral index for the scalar perturbations at the CMB scales,
and simultaneously include growth of uctuations and therefore blue-tilted/peaked power
spectra at smaller scales. If the small-scale inationary power spectrum is large enough
(0:02), it can lead to a copious amount of PBH formation in the RD epoch after the end
of ination.
However, on the other hand, various scenarios of alternate cosmological evolutions
after ination are being proposed, to explain, for example, the post-inationary fate of the
inaton/spectator elds/moduli elds or to incorporate additional dof which dominate the
energy density for some time, etc. For a given inationary power spectrum P(k), with
large amplitude at small scales, the mass spectrum of PBH is aected if they are formed
in such non-standard epochs. This review attempts to discuss the possible reasons behind
the occurrence of such non-standard post-inationary epochs as well as their eects on the
resulting abundance and relevant mass range for PBH, with attention to how the basic
contributory quantities are aected.
This review is structured as follows: in Section 2, the necessity for PBH analysis
in non-standard postinationary epochs has been motivated. In Section 3, possible and
relevant non-standard epochs have been discussed. In Section 4, a clear picture is provided
for the horizon exit and re-entry of the inationary uctuations. In Section 5, mathematics
to estimate PBH mass, mass spectra and abundance has been developed. This has been
carried out in two parts, one for a general non-standard epoch with nonzero pressure, and
one for a matter dominated epoch. In the same section, having been introduced to the
components that aect PBH formation and abundance, the eects of dierent contributors
and dierent methods to estimate them have been discussed. A few specically interesting
examples of non-standard epochs have been discussed in Section 6, with results shown
for two particular forms of the primordial power spectrum. In Section 7, discussions on
the current status and future prospects have been made. In this review, the reduced
Planck mass is denoted as MP= 2:441018GeV, and the solar mass is denoted as
M= 21033gm'1057GeV.
{ 3 {2 Importance in Current Phenomenology
Several types of observational and experimental data now constrain a signicant part of the
PBH parameter space. These constraints are expected to evolve in the near future with
the prospect of additional data and improved analysis. PBHs evaporate on a timescale
tev= 5120G2M3=(}c4) via Hawking radiation, and therefore PBHs of mass lower than
M'51014g'2:510 19Mhave completely evaporated by now [90]. Slightly
heavier PBHs have not completely evaporated yet and may radiate gamma-ray photons,
neutrinos, gravitons and other massive particles at dierent stages of evaporation. There-
fore, by constraining the injection of photons and neutrinos in the (extra-)galactic medium
using Voyager data, extra-galactic radiation background, SPI/INTEGRAL observations,
etc. [91{98], limits can be put on the abundance of light PBHs with M.10 17M. CMB
anisotropies and abundance of light elements at the time of BBN due to the energy de-
composition in the background by the evaporation products from the black holes [99] can
constrain PBHs for masses M5:510 21MandM'10 22 10 21M, respectively.
PBHs in the mass range 10 11M<M < 10 1Mare constrained by their gravitational
lensing of light rays from distant stars. Observation of the stars in the M31 galaxy by the
HSC telescope, the EROS and OGLE survey together now rule out the contribution of PBH
towards total DM density above 1{10% in this mass range [100{103]. The caustic crossing
event for the star Icarus or MACS J1149LS1 and the resultant strong lensing has been
used to place constraints on compact objects in the range 10 5M< M.103M[104].
The GW detections by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration put an upper bound on the total
PBH abundance in the mass region 0 :2M< M < 300M, assuming that the observed
binary BH mergers are PBH mergers in the early or late universe [105{115]. Finally, the
radiation from the accreted gas around PBHs of mass M&100Maects the spectrum
and the anisotropies of the CMB [116{118].
In Figure 1, a few of these bounds from several types of observations are shown for
monochromatic PBH mass spectrum [119]. Clearly, the only remaining window for PBH
to form 100% of dark matter is 10 16M< M.10 12M. However, there are bounds
from the capture of PBH by neutron stars at the dense core of a globular cluster [120]
and, from the shape of the observed distribution of white dwarfs [121], can put constraints
on this mass range as well. More stringent constraints in this mass range are expected to
come from the future observation of the stochastic background of induced GW in upcoming
surveys such as LISA [122{125] and DECIGO [126{128].

bounds from ultra-faint dwarf galaxies [132]; `CMB' signies bounds from Compton drag
and Compton cooling of CMB photons [133].
The abundance and masses of the PBH produced with a certain mechanism depend
on the details of the underlying model. In the case where the large overdensities collapsing
into PBH result from primordial inationary uctuations, there is a direct relation between
(i) the scales1=k(kis the wavenumber) for which the primordial perturbations are
large, and the PBH mass M; (ii) amplitude of the enhanced uctuations (amplitude of
the primordial power spectrum P(k)) and the PBH mass spectrum  (M), as well as the
total PBH abundance fPBH. Evidently, with the current constraints on PBH abundance,
it is extremely important to confront relevant models of ination, which can generate
largeP(k) at small scales, with PBH phenomenology. This way, constraints on PBH
abundance can put bounds on the inationary uctuations. However, the observational
bounds discussed above are typically given for a monochromatic PBH mass spectrum,
which is not the case when one analyses PBH formation from realistic models of ination.
In [134], a method was developed to generate bounds on the extended PBH mass spectra,
once the bounds for the monochromatic spectrum are known. Once the extended PBH mass
spectrum obtained from an ination model is treated with these modied observational
bounds, proper upper limits on P(k) can be imposed.
However, this statement is not exact if PBHs are formed in a non-standard epoch of
the unknown equation of state (EoS) and duration in the post-inationary universe. In
{ 5 {fact, PBH formation in a non-standard epoch with EoS wlasting from temperature Tto
TRDaects the one-to-one relationships between Mandkand between  (M) andP(k).
The dynamics of PBH formation obtains contributions from wandTRD1. These exact w
andTRD-dependent relations are developed in Section 5.2 in this review.
Large uctuations required for abundant PBH are usually accompanied by large non-
Gaussianities. The eect of primordial non-Gaussianity in the PBH abundance has also
been discussed in literature [135{140]. The non-Gaussianity parameters, such as fNL, are
weekly constrained even at the CMB scales by Planck 2018 [141, 142]. However, constraints
on PBH abundance while accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities can provide new
bounds on these parameters at small scales, which sheds light on the underlying mechanism
at small scales of ination.
If the primordial spectrum contains certain features, then they can be translated
into the PBH mass spectrum. For example, resonant oscillations around the peak of
P(k), which is ubiquitously seen in multi-eld models of ination with turns in the eld
space [46, 143{150], can be carried over to explicit oscillations in  (M), depending on the
detailed reason behind the resonant oscillations in P(k) in the rst place.
However, in the presence of a non-standard epoch, all of these constraints on PBH
getting translated into bounds on the small scale P(k) require inputs for the exact values
ofwandTRD. In the presence of a non-standard epoch, the PBH abundance obtains
inputs from both the inationary paradigm and the w-dominated epoch. Mathematically
speaking, both of these inputs can aect the nal PBH abundance by orders of magnitude
sinceP(k) appears as an exponent (see Equation (5.9)), and wappears in the powers
of theMandTRD(see Equation (5.6)). Therefore, considering the progress in lowering
observational bounds on PBH, it is necessary and timely to not only model the inationary
paradigm but also investigate the possibility of a non-standard post-inationary epoch.
Another extremely interesting avenue is induced gravitational waves (IGW) that can
be combined with the PBH phenomenology to provide a better understanding of the early
universe at small scales. In the second and higher orders of perturbation theory, scalar and
tensor perturbations are coupled. Therefore, adiabatic perturbations source higher order
tensor uctuations [151{154] (for a recent review, see [155]), which are subdominant with
respect to the rst order tensor modes for simple slow-roll models of ination with red-tilted
adiabatic power spectra. However, an enhanced P(k) can lead to a large induced tensor
power spectrum and therefore a large spectrum of IGW. Such IGWs are primordial in
nature and appear as stochastic backgrounds today. With the prospect of ground/space-
based interferometric detectors and pulsar timing arrays, the growing interest in using
IGW as a probe for the early universe is promising to have a detailed understanding of the
primordial uctuations. At large scales, the scalar uctuations are tightly constrained by
CMB observations and thus result in IGWs of tiny amplitude. However, models where the
scalar uctuations at small scales are signicantly enhanced, such as those leading to large
PBH abundance, can lead to large IGW spectra simultaneously.
1Tdoes not aect PBH formation when we assume that the formation process begins during the w-
dominated epoch, since the energy fraction contained in PBH at the time of formation depends only on the
temperature at formation.
{ 6 {Therefore, the scenario of abundant PBH formation is always accompanied with large
IGWs, but both of the dynamics depend on the epoch of collapse and the epoch of the IGW
sourcing of GW from scalar modes, respectively. The frequency fof the IGW depends on
the modekentering the horizon at the post-inationary time when the GW is sourced. If
PBHs are formed in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, then the wavenumber kentering
the horizon, PBH mass Mand frequency fof the IGW are related via the following relation:

The present and proposed GW surveys span over decades in the frequency space.

Ground based interferometric detectors such as LIGO/Virgo [6, 8, 12, 161], KAGRA [162,

DECIGO [126{128], AION/MAGIS [165], Taiji [166], and TianQin [167].
With the prospect of current and upcoming GW surveys, in the optimistic scenario
with positive detection of GW, the primordial P(k) can have constraints on its amplitude
and spectral index, which can help decrease the model space for ination. However, GWs
at the stochastic level may have several cosmological and astrophysical sources, and it may
be challenging to recognise an IGW signal with condence. One possible solution is to
check the spectral index of the observed GW spectrum since dierent processes predicting
stochastic GW signals usually have specic spectral signatures of the predicted GW spectra.
Even if there is no positive observation of GW, with gradually improving sensitivities of
the GW surveys, stricter upper bounds on P(k) can be provided.
Other than primordial scalar uctuations, gravitational waves can also be induced by
the Poisson isocurvature perturbations of very light PBHs (with M < 109g), accompanied
by an early PBH-dominated ( w= 0) epoch [168, 169]. Light PBHs formed in standard RD
or nonstandard epochs can also lead to gravitational waves via Hawking evaporation [170].
With the possibility of observing and constraining IGWs, the PBH phenomenology
is also improved, since we can obtain an even better understanding of the small scale
inationary dynamics. Starting from a model of ination with enhanced P(k) at small
scales, one generally studies the predictions for both PBH and IGW. However, the presence
of a non-standard epoch aects both of these processes. The IGW spectrum for a general
w-dominated epoch has been developed in detail in literature [155, 171].
2The numerical factor in the denominator of the second equality of (2.2) arises from (4 C(w))1+3w
3(1+w)
in Equation (5.7), and its value is put as 2 106here. It can vary between (2{6) 106for 1w>0.
{ 7 {Hence, even with the combined PBH-IGW analysis and phenomenology, which is of
great interest to current trends in inationary model building, if a non-standard epoch
is present after ination, then predictions and constraints must be rechecked [172]. One
interesting and hopeful aspect of such a combined phenomenological study is that the
relation between kandfis alwaysk= 2f, independent of which epoch the IGW is
sourced in. Thus, with an IGW observation, the actual peak position of P(k) can be found,
irrespective of a non-standard epoch. However, the relation between Mandkdepends on
wandTRD, and therefore can separately give information about the w-dominated epoch
in a combined study. However, this is not so straightforward as the IGW spectrum and
 (M) both depend on the post-inationary evolution, and therefore on wandTRD.
3 Non-Standard Epochs after Ination
There can be several scenarios leading to one or multiple epoch(s) of non-standard expan-
sion before or after BBN. This review discusses the deviations from standard evolution
only before BBN because the mass of the PBH corresponding to BBN is MBBN103M.
The PBHs of phenomenological interest, which can lead to reasonable DM abundance with
several bounds from astrophysical and cosmological surveys, are in the range of 1015gm
and100M, which form before BBN. Such post-inationary and pre-BBN non-standard
epochs can arise either from modications of standard CDM properties or the intro-
duction of entirely new components. However, in this review, we divide them into two
categories: reheating which begins at the end of ination and leads to standard RD either
instantaneously or slowly; and generalw-domination , which begins at some point during
standard RD and ends by the time of BBN.
3.1 Reheating
At the end of ination, the inaton ( ) energy density needs to be transferred to the
Standard Model (SM) degrees of freedom, as well as DM to commence standard RD. This
intermediate epoch, named (p)reheating [173, 174], is governed by the shape of the inaton
potential near the minimum and the couplings of the inaton to other elds. In case of
negligible couplings, if the single eld inaton potential has the form V()/jj2nnear the
minimum, then the homogeneous inaton condensate executes quasi-periodic oscillations
around the minimum of V() while the time-averaged equation of state (EoS) has the
form [175]
w=n 1
n+ 1: (3.1)
The process of reheating can include perturbative and/or non-perturbative parts. Since
the eective inaton mass m2
ed2V
d2varies with time during the oscillations of the con-
densate, resonant transfer of energy from the condensate to shorter wavelength modes is
possible [176{178], leading to rapid and non-adiabatic growth of short-wavelength uctu-
ations. The duration of the w-dominated epoch depends on the full shape of the inaton
potential. Quadratic behaviour of V() near the minimum ( n= 1) leads to w= 0, i.e.,
{ 8 {a matter dominated (MD) epoch, whose duration depends on the gravitational interac-
tions of the inaton condensate [179{191]. For a quartic form of V() near the minimum,
(n= 2),w= 1=3, i.e., a RD epoch is approached [183, 192]. However, typically at the end
of the resonant decay of the condensate, coupling of the inaton to other elds needs to be
invoked for the inaton to decay completely.
In the multi-eld ination models, if the inaton is directly coupled to other elds,
then the latter have eective masses dependent on [83{87, 178]. These couplings typi-
cally shorten the duration of the w-dominated epoch due to increased eciency of decay
processes. Moreover, inaton and the other elds may have nonminimal coupling to grav-
ity, or nontrivial eld-space manifolds, which can lead to noncanonical kinetic terms that
aid in the resonant decay of the inaton. In warm ination models [193, 194] where the
inaton energy density dissipates to a thermal bath during ination, the reheating process
may be even more hastened, if at all necessary.
The reheating process for both single and multi-eld ination scenarios is extremely
model dependent, more so in the latter case. Therefore, a w-dominated epoch during
reheating is also dependent on the underlying ination model and is relevant for the PBH
masses of interest only if this epoch is prolonged.
3.2 General w-Dominated Epoch
There are many well-motivated scenarios where the post-reheating universe is dominated
by a particle species  with a general EoS w, so that/a 3(1+w). For example, an
early matter dominated (EMD) epoch ( w= 0) may arise when a heavy eld drives the
energy density of the universe [195{199]. A well-motivated example of this kind is an
epoch dominated by moduli elds in several string ination models [88, 200]. On the other
hand, an epoch dominated by the kinetic energy density of a fast-rolling eld has w'1.
This may take place after an epoch of quintessential ination [201, 202], when the inaton
eld rolls down very fast from its inaton potential towards the potential relevant for dark
energy at a later stage. QCD phase transition may lead to a softening of the background
energy density of RD, i.e., EoS becomes w<1=3 for a small duration. These three special
cases will be discussed explicitly in reference to PBH formation in later sections.
More general values of ware possible when a scalar eld oscillates with a particular
potential form [203{206], in braneworld cosmologies [207, 208], scalar-tensor theories of
gravity [209, 210], etc. Particularly, sti EoS 1 =3< w1 may arise when a sterile eld
enters the post-inationary phase with a dominant energy contribution [206].
The onset of such non-standard epochs at temperature Tcan be determined by com-
paring their energy budget with respect to the standard RD energy density. For the universe
to transition into standard RD at temperature TRDat the end of a w-dominated epoch,
there are two main prescriptions: (i) the dominating eld  can decay with decay width
 and the relativistic decay products start dominating the universe as RD. In this case,
the Boltzmann equation is
+ 3(1 +w)H_=  : (3.2)
{ 9 {(ii) Ifw > 1=3, then the energy density of the species with EoS wdilutes faster than
radiation and therefore radiation takes over naturally.
In both of these cases, the transition to RD is typically assumed to be instantaneous,
but it can be slow depending on the details of model building (e.g., couplings of , model of
quintessential ination, etc.). However, the slow transition has to be treated with varying
wrather than a constant EoS, which itself is a complicated analysis. In the next section,
PBH formation in a few interesting cases is discussed in detail. The post-inationary
universe can also be dominated by light PBHs, which decay via Hawking radiation to
reheat the universe.
4 Primordial Fluctuations
Many cosmological scenarios have been proposed that can lead to PBH formation, of which
possibly the most popular scenario is when the primordial epoch of ination leads to scalar
uctuations ( : curvature perturbation)3, which become frozen soon after they exit the
inationary horizon in the simple case of single eld ination. For multi-eld inationary
scenarios, these perturbations grow even in the superhorizon regime until the end of in-
ation. These perturbations generate classical density uctuations (x;t) = b

being the background energy density, when they re-enter the post-inationary horizon:

scale factor.
These overdensities grow inside the post-inationary horizon and the nature of growth
is dictated by w. The overdense regions of scale Rwill stop expanding after some time
and collapse gravitationally against the pressure if the mass corresponding to Ris larger
than the Jeans mass. A critical value of the density contrast ccan also be dened,
such that the overdensities with clead to collapse and form PBH. The value of c
depends on the background and, for the RD epoch, it is 0:4. If, at the horizon scale, the
uctuations have a Gaussian distribution, then the analysis for collapse is easier, where c
resides at the tail of the distribution. In the case of primordial inationary uctuations,
a one-to-one relation can be developed between the mass of the PBH produced and the
wavenumber k= 2=R, and this relation crucially depends on w. Many examples in the
literature are devoted to envisaging inationary scenarios where the scalar uctuations
grow to large values during ination such that the power spectrum P(k) peaks around
a certain wavenumber kpkCMB, which can lead to PBH of mass Mkp. IfP(k) has a
broad peak around kp, which is the case in realistic inationary models, then the PBH
mass spectrum is also broad.
In Figure 2, the evolution of the horizon is shown as a function of the scale factor
for the standard case and with the inclusion of a non-standard w-dominated epoch after

scales plotted in dotted grey lines exit the horizon during ination, larger scale rst, and
re-enter the post-inationary horizon, smaller scale rst. The smaller scale plotted in
Figure 2 is such that it enters during w-domination. Depending on w, the scale factor ahc
at the time of horizon crossing of this scale is dierent, and as a result, Hhcdepends on w.
Therefore, the PBH mass Mformed due to the collapse of a mode kdepends on w. This
has been discussed in detail in Section 5.1. One interesting outcome in the presence of a
non-standard epoch is that the RD evolution before the onset of w-domination gets shifted
(see Figure 2). Moreover, the evolution in the inationary epoch decreases or increases for
a softer or harder EoS with respect to RD, respectively. This has important implications in
terms of inationary observables in CMB since the duration of ination aects the scalar
spectral index nsand tensor-to-scalar ratio r.
Large primordial uctuations are necessary for abundant PBH. For example, assuming
Gaussian probability distribution for the primordial uctuations, P10 2is required to
reach at least a percent level contribution of PBH into total DM when PBHs are formed in
a RD epoch (see the derivations in Section 5.2 and Table 1 in Section 6.4). For single-eld
models of ination, if the inaton slows down enough in its potential, then ultra slow-roll
(USR) conditions can be reached. In this case, the slow roll parameters VM2

P10 2at a smaller scales, Vneeds to decrease by 107orders in magnitude. This
USR mechanism leads to the growth of perturbations and therefore large P. The modes
for whichPis large are separated from the CMB modes since Pis constrained by the
Planck survey to have an amplitude 10 9and a red-tilt at CMB scales. For such models,
the steepest growth in P(k) isk4. To reach such an USR condition, many single eld
ination scenarios are modelled with a point of inection [27, 28, 31, 211{213] or a tiny
bump (or dip) [214] such that the eld velocity is negligible for a range of e-folds  N. There
can also be scenarios, where the non-canonical kinetic energy of the inaton can lead to a
decrease in the speed of sound, leading to interesting results for PBH formation [215{220].
PBHs can also be formed for ination models arising from scalar-tensor theories [221], with
non-minimal derivative coupling [222], from squeezed initial states [223], etc.

For multi-eld models of ination, the coupling with a secondary eld can induce a
largeP(k), since the inaton velocity now depends on the full multi-eld potential. As an
example, for the hybrid ination model [41], the mild waterfall phase leads to the growth
ofP(k). For multiple elds present during ination, there are other avenues that can
lead to growth in P(k), such as non-trivial coupling to gravity, non-canonical coupling
of the inaton and the secondary eld [148, 224] or from a large turning rate in the eld
space [46, 143{150], via inducing instabilities in the isocurvature uctuations that can be
transferred to curvature uctuations [225], etc. In the case of warm ination models, the
energetic coupling between the inaton and the thermal bath can lead to enhancement in
P(k) [226, 227]. In the case of PBH formation, necessary large quantum uctuations can
backreact on the long wavelength modes, and therefore the inationary dynamics can be
discussed in terms of stochastic ination [228{230].
A treatise of ination models leading to large scalar perturbations and eventually to
PBH can also be found in some other interesting reviews in this issue.
Other interesting methods of PBH production include the collapse of cosmic loops,
collapse through bubble nucleation, the collapse of Q-balls, and domain walls, etc. (see
Section 1 for references). The collapse mechanism can also be discussed as a critical phe-
nomena [231{234] where the mass of the PBH depends on the overdensity via a critical
{ 12 {parameter, such that

5 Formation of PBH: Analysis
The formation of PBH from large density uctuations is a probabilistically rare process.
This is because the overdensity, dened as  
whereand are the local and
average densities, can be very large only at the tails of the probability distribution. This
process is quantied by dening a threshold of PBH formation with the critical value of
the overdensity, c, such that only ccan result in collapse into a PBH. It will be clear
from the discussions of the current section that the dependence of con the background
EoS signicantly inuences PBH abundance. It is evident from the discussion in previous
sections that many components contribute to the formation of PBH. In this section, the
dependence of these components on the background EoS is discussed, and the relevant
mathematics is explained. The mechanism for PBH formation in a general w-dependent
epoch was rst discussed in [171]. While developing the mechanism and presenting the
results in the next section, the focus is on non-rotating PBHs, which neither lose any mass
due to Hawking radiation nor accrete4.
This subsection contains three main parts. In Section 5.1, the general w-dependent
relation between the PBH mass and wavenumber is formulated. In Section 5.2, PBH mass
spectrum has been developed for a general w-dependent epoch. Here, matter-dominated
formation is treated separately since there is no pressure to counter the inward gravitational
pull during PBH formation in this epoch. In Section 5.4, various quantities and mechanisms
contributing to the PBH mass spectrum are discussed in detail, including the merits and
demerits of simple assumptions that are generally used for these quantities.
5.1 Length Scale and PBH Mass
If overdensity corresponding to a scale with wavenumber kleads to PBH of mass M, then
one can nd a relation between these two given a particular background epoch. If His

5.2 Formation in a w-Dominated Epoch
If the probability of the gravitational collapse of an overdensity to a PBH is P(), then
the probability that PBH of mass Mhas formed is given by the mass fraction (M). If the
formation takes place in a w-dominated epoch, then (M) depends on wvia the critical
overdensity c(w), since, using Press{Schechter formalism,

6Here, we neglect the formation of PBHs of mass Mvia collapse or accretion anytime after the primordial
formation. The recent epoch of dark energy domination can be neglected as well since it started dominating
at around redshift z'1.
{ 16 {5.3 Formation in a Matter Dominated Epoch
The dierence between PBH formation in a MD epoch is dierent than what is discussed
above since the collapse dynamics are dierent in the absence of pressure. For an overdense
region collapsing in a pressureless background, the gravitational pull aiding in the collapse
is not contested by pressure. As a result, the sphericity of an initially spherical overdense
region gets aected, as is discussed in detail in [236], which uses Zel'dovich approximation,
Thorne's hoop conjecture, and Doroshkevich's probability distribution to compute the mass
fraction of PBH in a MD epoch. In this case, for perturbations of order 0:01, the mass
fraction was found to be
MD(M)'0:056(M)5: (5.16)
The mass function can then be found by putting w= 0 in Equation (5.13). Due to
the complete absence of pressure, PBHs formed in a MD epoch can have large spins [237],
the accretion dynamics [238] and clustering [239] can be dierent, and the ellipticity can
also aect the formation process [240, 241]. The growth of the overdensities after horizon
re-entry depends crucially on the EoS w. The formation in a MD epoch has to be discussed
explicitly since density perturbations grow linearly in MD so that p

O(1). Ifis dened in the linear regime at the time of horizon entry of the modes,
then the scale factor amat the time tmof maximum expansion is given by (am)=ahc,
whereahcis the scale factor at the time thcof horizon entry [242{246]. The time of
collapsetcis very close to tmand, therefore, the scale factor at tcisac'am. Thus,
tc=thc= (ac=ahc)3=2= 3=2. The Hubble parameters at horizon entry Hhcand at the
time of collapse Hcare therefore related as Hhc=Hc= 3=2. Thus, the PBH that is
formed from the mode that enters the horizon at thchas a mass

In the EMD epoch, the PBH mass formed as a result of collapse (when becomes
nonlinear) at time tccan be estimated using Equation (5.17). In comparison, note that the
growth of perturbations is logarithmic in a RD epoch, and therefore, the mass of PBHs
formed in RD can be estimated by Equation (5.2).
The PBH mass function in EMD is limited within two mass scales, MmaxandMmin,
corresponding to the largest and the smallest scales, respectively, that became nonlinear
during EMD. Mmaxcorresponds to the mode H 1
maxthat entered the horizon at some point
before reheating and collapsed at the time of reheating. Therefore, following the arguments
in the previous paragraph, Mmaxis given by [242]

than in a RD epoch due to the power law dependence of the mass fraction (M) on(M)
rather than an exponential dependence, which can be explored for dierent scenarios of
matter or near-dust dominated epochs [172, 248{252].
5.4 Understanding the Contributions
In the last section, dierent quantities have been introduced which contribute to the PBH
abundance in DM. Some of these quantities are very relevant from a phenomenological
point of view. Some of these quantities are assumed to have simple forms, which is easier
to work with when one studies specic scenarios of PBH formation; however, there can be
well-motivated scenarios where these assumptions are violated. In this section, a few such
quantities are discussed with reference to the validity of their values or forms and their
impact on the PBH abundance.
5.4.1 Critical Overdensity c
Throughout many decades, the eort to compute the critical overdensity (also termed as
the density threshold for PBH formation) has been in progress. In 1974 and 1975, Carr and
Hawking [2, 3] used the Jeans instability criterion in Newtonian gravity to deduce cc2
s,
wherecsis the sound speed, and for a static uid, c2
s=w. After that, many attempts
have been made with numerical hydrodynamic solutions and more in [231, 247, 253{256].
In [231], the lengthscale of the perturbation was measured with a Gaussian shaped prole
for, whereas Ref. [255] measured the local peak of the curvature prole. These two anal-
yses used dierent approaches and assumptions about the decaying mode of perturbations
and reached dierent conclusions for cin a RD epoch. In [257], cwas measured using
the linear relation between curvature and energy density prole. While Refs. [255, 257]
measured the local value of c, Refs. [231, 233] measured the average c. In 2013, Harada
et al. [258] deduced canalytically using a three-zone model for the overdensity prole by
imposing the requirement that the time taken by the pressure sound wave to cross the scale
of the overdense region is larger than the time of onset of the gravitational collapse. This
work resulted in the following w-dependent expression for cin the comoving gauge, which
is used in this review:
c=3(1 +w)
(5 + 3w)sin2pw
(1 + 3w)
: (5.19)
However, the critical value calso depends crucially on the shape of the density prole,
which can be parameterised as
= r2
mC00(rm;t)
4C(rm;t); (5.20)
whereC(r;t) =2M(r;t)
R(r;t)is the compaction function dened as the ratio of the mass excess
over the physical radius, and R=a(t)ris the aerial radius of the overdense region. Primes
denote derivatives with respect to the position r, andrmis the position where C(r;t) is
maximised. 1(1) signies a broad (narrow) peak. The form of cin Equation (5.19),
which does not account for the shape, is more precise for !0, since broader proles
may `bounce back' and disfavor the collapse.
{ 18 {ccan also be calculated from the compaction function, focussing on the local values
of(r) with radius rinside the spherical overdense region. This process thus takes into
account the shape of the density prole. Although the calculation of cby comparing the
pressure and gravitational pull using the three-zone model and therefore Equation (5.19) is
very popular, and used in this review, using the compaction function provides more insight
into the shape of the peak prole and in general is more useful in scenarios that include
nonlinearities and non-Gaussianities.
In this formalism, one focuses on the peak prole of either the metric perturbation (^r),
or the curvature perturbation K(r) [259{261]. In terms of K(r), the perturbed metric is:
ds2= dt2+a2(t)dr2

In addition, in terms of the metric perturbation (^r), it is

The coordinate transformation between (^r) andK(r) dictates
r= ^re(^r)

1 K(r)r2=e(^r)d^r: (5.23)
From the rst expression in Equation (5.23), the dierential relation between rand ^r
is obtained to bedr
d^r=e(^r)(1 + ^r0(^r)): (5.24)
Thus,(^r) andK(r) are related as
K(r)r2= ^r0(^r)
2 + ^r0(^r)
: (5.25)
The averaged density contrast, which is a more relevant quantity of interest in case of
an extended peak prole of K(r), can be written (at horizon crossing) as:
~(r) =f(w)K(r)r2; (5.26)
wheref(w) =3(1+w)
(5+3w), andris the radius of the spherical comoving volume on which it
has been averaged. The coordinate origin is at the location of the peak. PBH formation
criteria are expressed in terms of the compaction function C(r;t). Now, for a particular
peak prole of K(r) or(^r), there are two scales of importance: the scale r0where the
local density contrast crosses zero and the scale rmwhere the compaction function reaches
the maximum value. Thus, ~0(r) =f(w)K(r0)r2
0and ~m(r) =f(w)K(rm)r2
m. The
considered in a PS formalism is equivalent to ~0, but ~mand~0are dierent in general.
For a particular peak prole for curvature, one can determine r0,rm,~0and~min

abundance as when the linear relationship is used. In [263], nonlinear statistics relevant to
nding PBH abundance have been developed using C(r;t) as the main statistical variable.
Given the dependence of con the shape of the overdensity prole, nonlinearities and
non-Gaussianities, peak theory (PT) calculation of the abundance is majorly used in the
literature to account for such non-trivialities. However, in this review, Press{Schechter
(PS) theory is used to simplify the calculations. A comparison of PS and PT has been
discussed in Section 5.4.3. Other methods to compute PBH abundance focussing on the
density prole have been discussed in [265{267]. In [265], extreme value theory is used
since large values of energy density are reached, which lead to a narrower mass prole and
peak at a larger mass as compared to other methods using Gaussian prole, although the
total abundance is boosted.
{ 20 {5.4.2 Density Distribution P()
In realistic models of ination where the uctuations are large enough to lead to post-
inationary collapse and PBH, such as those discussed in Section 4, the inationary dy-
namics are usually complicated. The same mechanism that leads to the growth of per-
turbations may also contribute to large non-Gaussianities [135{140, 268]. Therefore, the
viability of a Gaussian P() that leads to the simple form of for PBH mass fraction in
Equation (5.31) needs to be checked when one starts from a specic model of ination:
(M) = erfccp
2(M)
(5.31)
In [136, 137], primordial non-Gaussianities were included to nd that the PBH abun-
dance depends very sensitively on the primordial non-Gaussianities, and therefore primor-
dial non-Gaussianities on small scales can have constraints from constraints on the PBH
abundance in certain cases. It is to be noted here that c, typically being very large
(.O(1)), resides at the tail of P(). Therefore, the uctuations with >care rare, albeit
present, even in models of ination with slow-roll maintained throughout the epoch. In
such a case, there will be a very small, but nonzero probability of collapse; however, it
leads to a very tiny mass fraction (M) and therefore negligible PBH abundance.
While starting from a model of ination, P(k) typically has a certain width, which
does not lead to a monochromatic mass function for PBH. In the simplest scenarios, P(k)
with a peak at k=kpcan be approximated in a Gaussian form near the peak as
P(k) =P0exp[ (log(k=kp))2
22
]: (5.32)
Therefore, in this case, the actual (M) in Equation (5.10) can be signicantly dierent
from the approximation in Equation (5.11). The variance of the window function W(k;R)
should also be chosen judiciously, depending on 2
. In models of multi-eld ination, a
resonant oscillation in P(k) around the peak is a common feature that can originate from
turns in the eld space manifold. In this case, smoothening with the window functions
needs to be conducted with caution.
5.4.3 Various Methods to Calculate (M)
There are several methods to calculate the mass fraction of PBH formation given c, of
which Press{Schechter formalism (PS) and Peak theory (PT) [269{271] have gained the
most popularity. Whereas the PS method uses the average value of in an overdense region
to compare with the critical overdensity to evaluate the PBH abundance, PT focuses on
the local distribution of the overdensities, and therefore takes a probabilistic approach to
count the number of overdensity peaks. Equation (5.8) in the previous subsection has been
formulated using the PS mechanism.
Naively, the curvature perturbation is expected to be the relevant variable for the
Gaussian distribution, which is one of the basic assumptions in PS formalism. However,
while taking into account the local distribution of uctuations, the absolute value of is
{ 21 {not relevant, and this brings into question the necessity of a proper statistical variable. In
PT, the statistical approach is derived in terms of a much more reliable variable 
rms,
wherermsis the root mean squared value of the density uctuations. In the simplest
scenario,is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable, although non-Gaussianities can
be incorporated in the analysis, as discussed in [271]. The dierential number density

5.4.4 Constant w
The analysis detailed in Section 5.2 as well as most of the literature discussing PBH for-
mation in a non-standard epoch consider the EoS wto be constant during that epoch.
Section 5.2 considers the simplest case where the universe also transitions from w-domination
{ 22 {to RD instantaneously. For example, in models where a heavy eld dominates the energy
density with w= 0, the decay of the eld to relativistic particles (reheating) is considered
to be instantaneous for simplicity. However, in practice, for almost all of the non-standard
scenarios,wis not constant. Even if it can be assumed to be constant for most of the
non-standard evolution, the transition to RD usually happens over a certain duration of
time, which can be modelled by interpolating wbetween the non-standard value and 1 =3
for RD. However, the dynamics of PBH formation become complicated for a dynamic w.
PBH formation during slow reheating after ination, where the EoS slowly transitions from
0 to 1=3, has been explored in [89]. They found that the mechanism gradually changes
from the MD to RD case for  <c= 0:005, below which the mechanism is aected even
before the end of reheating. Using Treh= 4 MeV, they have found that the heaviest PBH
that can be produced in the critical case with c= 0:005 is100M. PBH formation in
a (p)reheating epoch is also discussed in [272{275]. Recently, Ref. [276] showed that, in
this case, it is necessary to solve for the critical overdensity cnumerically, with piecewise
solutions in terms of the conformal time .
6 Results for Specic Cases
Dierent possible scenarios where a non-standard post-inationary epoch can exist have
been discussed in Section 3. The EoS in such an epoch depends on the dominant component
of energy density. There are certain well-motivated scenarios where the non-standard epoch
is relevant for boosting PBH production. In this section, results for the PBH mass fraction
for some specic interesting cases of non-standard post-inationary epochs are discussed.
We demonstrate our results using the following two forms of the primordial power
spectrum near the peak at k=kpthat are widely used to model the inationary power
spectra without starting from a particular model. While presenting the results, we use
= 0:33 andTRD= 100 GeV.
6.1 Gaussian Power Spectrum
In many models of smooth waterfall hybrid ination [41] and several inection point models
of ination [31], the potential features a plateau for a few e-folds before the end of ination.
This plateau regime of the potential can lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum,
which, at the simplest approach, can be written as a Gaussian power spectrum (GPS) of
the following form:
P(k) =P0exp[ (log(k=kp))2
22
]: (6.1)
In order to demonstrate the results, = 1 has been used.
6.2 Broken Power Law Power Spectrum
In various scenarios of the early universe where PBH is produced from domain walls or
vacuum bubbles [74, 75], the relevant primordial curvature power spectrum has a broken
{ 23 {power law (BPS) form such as:
P(k) =8
>><
>>:P0
k
kpm
k<kp;
P0
k
kp n
kkp(6.2)
In order to demonstrate the results, m= 3 andn= 0:5 have been used. In Equa-
tions (6.1) and (6.2), only the form of the power spectra near the peak are represented.
Whenever necessary, the CMB consistent part As(k=k)ns 1needs to be added to both of
them to obtain the full power spectra.
6.3 Kinetic Energy Dominated Epoch
In a model of quintessential ination, where the scalar eld performs the role of inaton
in the early universe and of dark energy in the late universe with dierent forms of the
potential, the inaton needs to survive at the end of ination and non-trivial reheating
processes need to be implemented. The eld needs to travel between the two forms of
the potential at early and late times, which can lead to a fast roll of in the intermediate
regime. This gives rise to a large kinetic energy of , which can come to dominate the
universe for some time. During the epoch of such kinetic energy domination (KD), the
pressurep', such that the EoS of the epoch is w'1.
In [171], the mechanism of PBH formation in a non-standard post-inationary epoch
was applied to w= 1 for three dierent types of power spectra to show that, in order to
achieve the same PBH abundance, formation in a KD epoch requires less peak amplitude
of the primordial power spectrum. If PBHs are formed due to the overdensities entering
in thisw= 1 epoch, then the resulting modication in (M) and (M), as compared to
RD formation of PBH, can be evaluated using Equations (5.31) and (5.13).
In the following, it is shown that, for the same value of the peak amplitude of the
primordial power spectra, P0= 0:02, PBH abundance in a KD epoch is more than that in
a RD epoch. In Figure 4, the mass fraction (M) is plotted for the KD and RD epochs for
GPS and BPS as a function of the PBH mass normalized with Mpeak=M(kpeak). From
Equation (5.7), one can nd that M=M peak= (k=kpeak) 3(1+w)
1+3w; thus, the power spectra for
GPS and BPS can be described only in terms of =k=kpeak, without needing to specify
kpeak. Considerable improvement in the mass fraction for the KD case can be seen here.
(M) is larger in the KD case than the RD case for a range of (0.1{10) Mpeakfor the GPS,
whereas for BPS, this range is (0.005{2) Mpeak(outside the range of the plot). Figure 5
shows the improvement in the weighted mass function M (M) for the same scenarios, but
with specic values of Mpeak, sinceM (M)/M 2w
1+w. The plots here are for Mpeak= 1, 10
and 0:1M; however, similar improvements in M (M) can be seen for other peak masses
as well. Here, the results are shown for two cases for the transition from the KD to RD
epoch,TRD= 10 MeV (blue and green curves) and TRD= 5 MeV (cyan and grey curves).
It can be seen that, when a PBH of a particular mass is produced, a lower value of TRD
leads to larger PBH abundance, which is expected from the dependence  (M)/T 1

{ 25 {In [171],M (M) for the KD and RD epochs is compared for two dierent values of
kpeakleading to abundant PBH around MandM'1018gm. PBHs of mass around these
two specic masses are of great interest since the former is of the order of black hole masses
observed in binary mergers in LIGO/Virgo observations, whereas for the latter case, the
possibility to attain 100% of DM as PBHs is still not ruled out by observational bounds.
Further results about PBH formation in a KD epoch can be found in [171] including the
primordial amplitudes required for reaching 10% PBH abundance in DM, as well as the
relevant modications for IGW formed in a KD epoch.
6.4 Early Matter Dominated Epoch
An early epoch of matter domination can occur when a heavy eld dominates the energy
density for some time (see discussion in Section 3.2). A well-studied example is moduli
domination (mD) after ination. Moduli is a scalar eld  which at the end of ination is
frozen at its initial value  0. It starts moving in the potential once the Hubble parameter is
such thatH'm. Then, it keeps oscillating about the minimum of its potential, and the
energy density carried by the eld redshifts as matter ( a 3). This energy density dilutes
slower than radiation and thus, at some time T=T, the energy density of the moduli
starts to dominate the universe, marking the onset of mD. Finally, at T=TRD, the moduli
decay (assuming instantaneous decay here) into visible and dark sector particles to produce
a thermal bath of temperature that is suitable for BBN. Typically, the decay width   of
a moduli eld is given by
 =m3

The bound from BBN temperature translates to a bound on the moduli mass m&
135 TeV. If m= 500 TeV, then the transition from mD to RD occurs (assumed to be
instantaneous) at TRD'30 MeV.
PBH formation in a mD epoch is explored in [251], where it is shown that, even
though PBHs of mass 0.1{10 Mcan be produced in abundance in a mD epoch lasting up
toTRD= 4:3 MeV, they can explain only a few of the events in LIGO/Virgo observations,
and can only contribute to 4% of total DM abundance. If PBHs are formed due to the
overdensities entering in this w= 0 mD epoch, then the resulting modication in (M) and
 (M) as compared to RD formation of PBH can be evaluated using Equations (5.31), (5.16)
and (5.13). Here, the results are also shown in terms of Mpeak=M(kpeak). For the mD
epoch,P0= 510 3has been used to show the results, whereas, for RD, P0is the same
as before.

signify the cases with Mpeak= 1, 10 and 0 :1M, respectively.
{ 27 {In Figure 6, the mass fraction (M) is plotted for the mD and RD epochs for GPS
and BPS as a function of the PBH mass normalized with Mpeak=M(kpeak). Here, the
improvement in the mass fraction for the mD case is evident; (M) is larger in the mD
case than the RD case for a very large range due to the power law dependence of (M) on
the primordial power spectrum (see Equation (6)), even for a lower value of P0in the mD
case.
Figure 7 shows the improvement in the weighted mass function M (M) for the same
scenarios, but with specic values of Mpeak. However, for w= 0,M (M) =M0; therefore,
there is only one of each blue and cyan curve in this gure. These results are shown for
two dierent transitions from the mD to RD epoch with TRD= 30 MeV (blue and green
curves) and TRD= 5 MeV (cyan and grey curves)7. Contrary to the KD case, here a
lower value of TRDleads to smaller PBH abundance, which can be understood from the
dependence  (M)/TRDin Equation (5.14) for w= 0.
It can also be seen explicitly that the peak amplitude of the primordial power spectrum
in GPS required to produce a certain abundance of PBH is lower in both of the KD and
mD cases as compared to the RD case. Here, Table 1 shows the required values of P0
to produce 10% PBH abundances in these three epochs for two dierent values of Mpeak
withTRD= 5 MeV for all the cases. As expected, the P0values required in KD and
mD cases (last two columns) are lower than in the RD case (third column); however, for
the caseMpeak= 10 12M, theP0required for mD is barely smaller than that required
for the RD. This can be explained with the maximum mass that can be produced in a
nonstandard epoch. For KD, the heaviest PBH of mass M= 1240Mis produced when
the perturbations enter the horizon at with TRD= 5 MeV. However, for PBH formation
in the mD epoch, as explained in the paragraphs before and after Equation (5.17) in
Section 5.3, the heaviest mass produced for TRD= 5 MeV is much smaller, M'3M.
This sets upper limits for the integral in Equation (5.15), which aects the total abundance.

6.5 QCD Epoch
During QCD phase transition around T'200 MeV, the strong interactions conne quarks
into hadrons, while the eective number of relativistic dof changes rapidly. During this
transition, thermodynamic quantities evolve smoothly, whereas the change in dof induces
sudden dips in the EoS w(T) and sound speed cs(T). Lattice QCD studies can deduce the
evolution of w(T) andc2
s(T) during this transition. In [277, 278], the change in the critical
7TRD= 5 MeV corresponds to m= 149 TeV.
{ 28 {overdensity cdue to the change in w(T) is derived. Dips in w(T) andc2
s(T) correspond
to sudden transitions in cas much as from the usual RD value 0 :453 to a lower value
0:405. Even this much change in ccan induce a large boost for PBH formation due to the
exponential dependence of  (M) onc. If a nearly scale-invariant density power spectrum
enters the horizon during this time, then the PBH mass spectrum is boosted around the
massM=O(1)M(Ref. [277] predicts the precise value of M= 0:7M).
The idea of a softening of the EoS at particular energy scales has been extrapolated
in [278] for the epochs when the pressure suddenly drops at W=Z0decoupling and during
e+e annihilation, which resulted in boosting the PBH production for specic masses,
which, interestingly, can explain some of the observed black holes in LIGO/Virgo surveys.
Recently, Ref. [276, 279] studied the cdetermination for a dynamic wand implemented
this method to nd a variation in c(T), which is slightly dierent from previous studies
with constant w[280].
7 Discussions
The growing area of research on the topic of probing the early universe using PBHs is of
utmost importance since it can shed light on both the small scales of ination that are inac-
cessible to CMB surveys and the cosmological evolution before BBN. In this review, eects
of possible non-standard epochs on PBH formation are discussed in detail with specic
examples. The dependences of the main contributing quantities to the PBH abundance on
the subtleties of model building and underlying assumptions have also been emphasised.
From an observational point of view, there are two main interesting aspects here: (i)
surveys such as LIGO/Virgo may already have observed PBHs in the black hole merger
events; (ii) some or all of the DM content in the universe can be explained with PBHs. For
point (i), several propositions are made with particular ination + post-ination modelling
to look for a good amount of PBH formation in the mass range consistent with the observed
black holes in the LIGO/Virgo \stellar graveyard"8. For point (ii), various signicant
properties of PBH, such as lensing, Hawking radiation, etc., are used to provide upper
bounds on the amount of PBHs of particular masses as DM. While developing a specic
scenario of PBH formation, one checks the consistency of the predicted PBH abundance
in DM with the observational bounds. This has been discussed more quantitatively, with
specic examples of observational surveys in Section 2. In the same section, GWs induced
by the large scalar uctuations necessary for PBH formation are also discussed. Checking
the consistency of predicted IGWs in dierent models with current and prospective GW
surveys leads to interesting phenomenology since it can at least put upper bounds on the
primordial power spectrum at relevant small scales. However, in the presence of a non-
standard post-inationary epoch, the amplitude and spectral shape of the IGW are also
modied. The importance of combining PBH and IGW phenomenology, particularly in the
presence of such non-standard cosmologies, is emphasised in this section.
In Section 3, general ideas about the origin of non-standard post-inationary evolu-
tion have been put forward in the context of reheating epoch and additional epochs after
8Seehttps://www.ligo.caltech.edu/MIT/image/ligo20211107a (accessed on 12/02/2023).
{ 29 {instantaneous/slow reheating. In general, and as in this review, trivial assumptions are
made, such as an instantaneous reheating epoch and an instantaneous transition from a
non-standard w-dominated epoch to RD, but a realistic model of ination is seldom that
simple. Nevertheless, a lack of concrete understanding about inationary reheating as well
as a possible decay of additional dof after ination (e.g., second reheating by a heavy eld
after its energy density dominated the universe with w= 0) motivates one to present the
general idea at rst with such simple assumptions, and add complexities later on. However,
works on PBH formation in slow reheating epochs and the exact evolution of cduring a
dynamical EoS are interesting and very important, which reduce some of the uncertainties
in specic cases. In this sense, Figure 2 depicting the evolution of the scales of uctuation
and horizon will be modied for a realistic scenario with  Nrhnumber of e-folds attributed
to inationary reheating and ( N;NRD) e-folds attributed to the transition from RD to
w-domination and back from w-domination to standard RD, respectively. In Section 4, the
cosmological evolution with the aforesaid assumptions has been discussed. Dierent exam-
ples of ination models and the underlying mechanisms (e.g., inection point) to result in
growingP(k) have also been referenced.
In Section 5, the main formalism for PBH formation in non-standard epochs has been
developed. Firstly, the general w-dependent relation between PBH mass Mand cosmolog-
ical scales has been derived. The appearance of the additional parameter where already
hints at the modied relation between the inationary sector ( P(k)) and the PBH sector
( (M)). The PBH mass fraction (M) and mass function  (M) have been developed for
generalwas well as for the special case of w= 0, i.e., an early matter dominated epoch.
In a MD epoch, due to the complete absence of pressure, the process of PBH formation is
quite dierent and can incorporate interesting properties such as ellipticity, spin, etc. The
basic quantities necessary to calculate the PBH abundance are the threshold of overdensity
c, the distribution of overdensities P(), and initial mass fraction (M). Eects of non-
linearities, non-Gaussianities, and the shape of the uctuation prole on these quantities
have been discussed here, mentioning the simplied assumptions considered in this review.
In Section 6, the formalism developed in Section 5 is applied for specic cases of non-
standard evolution, namely kination w= 1 and moduli domination w= 0, and discussed
for the softening of the EoS from the RD case during QCD transition. For all of these cases,
PBH abundance is enhanced around the peak, which is shown for two dierent types of
primordial power spectra (Equations (6.1) and (6.2)) for KD and mD cases. PBHs formed
in the KD epoch can reach a higher abundance around the peak for the same order of peak
amplitude as in RD, which is taken here to be P0= 0:02. However, for mD, there is a gain
in PBH abundance even for P0= 510 3compared toP0= 0:02 in RD. Mathematically,
this improvement can be attributed to the power law relation between (M) and(M) for
mD as compared to the exponentially small dependence for w>0.
The plots in this section are for specic values of TRD= 10 MeV and TRD= 5 MeV for
KD andTRD= 30 MeV and TRD= 5 MeV for mD epochs, respectively. Naively, decreasing
TRDincreases the PBH abundance further since the enhanced formation mechanism for
w6= 1=3 sustains for a longer time. For w > 1=3, this is evident from the dependence
of (M) onTRDin Equation (5.13) as  (M)T1 3w
RD. Forw < 1=3, e.g., in MD,
{ 30 {this dependence does not aid in enhancing abundance; however, the strong power law
dependence between (M) and(M) again may come to the rescue to make the MD
abundance of PBH more than the RD dominated one. However, as discussed before, for
w= 0, (M)/TRDmeans that ending an mD epoch later decreases the PBH abundance.
It should also be mentioned here that, in order to achieve 10% abundance for both of the
cases in Table 1, P0>0:01, which does not strictly obey the condition for estimating the
numerical results of [236] as the power law result for (M) in Equation (5.16). However,
assuming that, by choosing a proper window function in Equation (5.10),  < 0:01 can
still be obtained with these values of P0, the calculations are continued with the form in
Equation (5.16).
With the mechanism at hand, albeit with various simplied assumptions, it is high time
to work with specic and concrete scenarios, leading to a combination of CMB consistent
ination models with growth in P(k) at small scales and some duration of non-standard
post-inationary evolution. It is also of utmost importance to check the viability of the
linear relation between the primordial uctuations and density perturbations for specic
cases and incorporate primordial non-Gaussianities whenever necessary. If the uncertainties
about (p)reheating and/or transition between w-dominated and RD epochs can be reduced
for certain cases, then the predictions for PBH as well as IGW will be much more rigorous,
which is hopeful for the verication of a particular scenario of the primordial universe with
observations.
