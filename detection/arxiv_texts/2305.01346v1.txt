Abstract ‚ÄîHoneypots are a well-known and widely used
technology in the cybersecurity community, where it is
assumed that placing honeypots in different geographical
locations provides better visibility and increases effectiveness.
However, how geolocation affects the usefulness of honeypots
is not well-studied, especially for threat intelligence as early
warning systems. This paper examines attack patterns in
a large public dataset of geographically distributed honey-
pots by answering methodological questions and creating
behavioural proÔ¨Åles of attackers. Results show that the
location of honeypots helps identify attack patterns and
build proÔ¨Åles for the attackers. We conclude that not all
the intelligence collected from geographically distributed
honeypots is equally valuable and that a good early warning
system against resourceful attackers may be built with only
two distributed honeypots and a production server.

1. Introduction
Despite the long-standing tradition of using honeypots
in computer security, our community still does not fully
understand the relationship between the geographic lo-
cation of honeypots (targets) and attacks. Many papers
describe the properties of attacks on a honeypot [4],
but there is a lack of research on the attack patterns
(or the lack of patterns) towards multiple geographically
distributed honeypots.
There is a common assumption that geographically
distributed honeypots help detect more attacks and attack-
ers because the location may inÔ¨Çuence visibility [13], [20].
However, attack patterns seem complex to understand and
predict, and the exact value of the information gathered
is unclear at best [12]. Understanding these patterns may
signiÔ¨Åcantly help the design of threat intelligence collec-
tion and their alleged utility as early warning systems.
Honeypot technology has been used successfully for
many purposes, and extensive research has been done
analysing the IP addresses of attackers, which ports are
attacked, and the type of attacks [23], [29]. These analyses
show that the number of attacks has varied over time and
that there are many different types. Even some attack
propagation models have focused on how the attackers
attack [5]. However, no deep analysis has been doneto Ô¨Ånd and understand attack patterns‚Äô long-term, stable
properties beyond their numbers.
This paper explores attack patterns in geographically
distributed honeypots by (i) using a public dataset of dis-
tributed honeypots for long-term, (ii) designing method-
ological questions to answer, (iii) processing data to ex-
tract results that answer the questions, (iv) creating be-
havioural proÔ¨Åles of attackers, (v) analysing the implica-
tions of the results.
Among the main questions asked are: Where do at-
tacks originate from? How much do attackers attack?
What do attackers attack? How do attackers attack? Can
the attackers‚Äô behaviour be proÔ¨Åled? Does the geolocation
of a honeypot impact the results obtained? Answers to
these questions give rise to others, such as: What is the
value of honeypots as early warning systems?
Results are disaggregated by attackers, attacks, pro-
Ô¨Åles, number of honeypots and services attacked. From
all attackers (source IP addresses), Asia has the larger
amount with 54.87% (almost as expected due to Internet
population), and North America has 15.01% (almost dou-
ble as expected). In services attacked, 89% of attackers
attack only one port (10.99% more than one). The highest
median number of attacks, 54, is for attackers that attacked
more than 5 ports and all 8 honeypots, but the highest
average number of attacks is for attackers that attacked
more than 5 ports and only in 1 honeypot (2,222.12).
Regarding the proÔ¨Åles of attackers, the highest number
ofattackers (73.26%) are the casual focused (1 port,
1 honeypot), but the highest number of attacks come
from the driven explorers (<1honeypot and >1port).
In general, results show that Asia produces attacks as
expected by its Internet population, Africa produces much
fewer attacks, Europe produces slightly more, and North
America produces more than twice the expected attacks
by its Internet population.
We conclude that geographically distributed honeypots
can play an important role in identifying attackers‚Äô proÔ¨Åles
and attack patterns. This is because multiple honeypots
help correlate and separate the casual attacker from the
driven one. Honeypots can be used as early warning
systems but notall the intelligence collected is equally
essential. We conclude that with only two distributed
honeypots and a production system, organisations can
defend against the most aggressive and driven attackers
while ignoring the vast majority of casual attackers.

2. Previous Work
In the past few years, several studies have proposed the
use of honeypots placed in multiple geographical regions,
mostly using cloud-based deployments. Some studies were
narrowly focused on emulating only one service, such as
SSH [7] or TELNET [26]. In contrast, others focused on
speciÔ¨Åc domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) [25],
[26] or Industrial Control Systems (ICS) [10].
Srinivasa et al. [25] extended the RIoTPot honeypot
and emulated six different protocols related to IoT. The
deployment period was three months. The geographical
dispersion of their honeypots was limited to four cities
since the main focus of the study was the comparison
between the effect of the different types of honeypot
interaction (low, medium, and high). The study found that
high-interaction honeypots receive more attacks over time,
but the distribution of attack types (brute-force, port scans,
etc.) was similar. The dataset is shared on request.
Kelly et al. [14] used ten different honeypots that
emulated multiple services and an Intrusion Detection
System (IDS). The honeypots were deployed in three
cloud providers and three geographical regions for three
weeks. However, most honeypots were placed on the east
coast of the United States, and only two were outside the
US (one in the United Kingdom and one in Singapore).
One of the main questions the authors tried to address
was whether the attackers prefer to attack services hosted
in cloud providers that have a higher market share. Their
analysis showed no distinction between providers when
it comes to attacking frequency, attacker geolocation, and
targeted vulnerabilities. The dataset was not published.
A similar study was conducted by Priya et al. [19]. The
study was limited to ten days and to only two geographicalTABLE 1: Summary of the CTU Hornet 40 dataset, for
the complete 40 days, showing the total number of unique
source IP addresses (attackers) that connected to each
honeypot and the total number of Ô¨Çows received per
honeypot (attacks).

regions (India and Japan). The authors focused mainly on
analysing DDoS attacks, including any post-exploitation
commands executed in the honeypots for downloading
the malware responsible for the attacks. The dataset was
published, but network data is sparse.
SSH and TELNET services are very popular attack
targets due to the plethora of IoT devices using them and
the number of vulnerabilities these devices have. Sophos,
a cybersecurity company, published a study where they
deployed SSH-only honeypots to ten different Amazon
cloud locations for 30 days [7]. Their analysis focused on
the usernames and passwords mostly frequently used by
attackers and the IoT devices associated with the respec-
tive default credentials. A TELNET-based low interaction
honeypot with weak credentials was the basis of the
deployment in [26]. The authors deployed honeypots in 13
different countries, trying to answer questions regarding
attack neutrality in cyberspace. Their main Ô¨Ånding was
that low-sophistication attackers do not consider the lo-
cation of their targets and that their attacks are mostly
automated. The dataset was not published.
The only work that tries to identify attack propagation
patterns between honeypots is from Bar et al. [5]. The
authors propose to use Markov Chains and complex net-
work analysis to model attack propagation. They deployed
267 honeypots worldwide using four different honeypot
software emulating multiple services. The deployment
lasted for a year. The work identiÔ¨Åed propagation patterns
between ‚Äùcommunities‚Äù of honeypots; however, these pat-
terns are not actionable from a threat intelligence perspec-
tive. The dataset was not published.
3. Dataset
To analyse attackers and attacks across regions, we
used the CTU Hornet 40 dataset [28]. The dataset contains
4;747;081attacks, performed by 265;423unique attack-
ers, to 8geographically-distributed honeypots, during 40
days. The data was captured from April 23rd, 2021 to
June 1st, 2021. Table 1 presents a summary of the dataset
per geographical location, the number of unique source IP
addresses, and the number of network Ô¨Çows per honeypot.
The network Ô¨Çows are bidirectional, meaning they
aggregate packets‚Äô features in both directions: from sourceIP to destination IP and vice versa. Eight Virtual Private
Servers (VPS) were rented in the same VPS provider [9].
VPS servers were rented in eight cities: Amsterdam, Ban-
galore, Frankfurt, London, New York, San Francisco, Sin-
gapore, and Toronto. The cities were chosen to maximise
the coverage of continents conditioned on the availability
of the VPS provider. Each Linux-based VPS was conÔ¨Åg-
ured to act as a passive honeypot without any service,
receiving attacks without running any honeypot software.
This was done to receive an unbiased sample per port
attacked, not conditioned on the open ports [25].
The dataset was loaded into a free self-hosted instance
of Splunk [24], a security information and event man-
agement system for analysis, data enrichment, generation
of statistics, and graphs. The dataset was also processed
using Pandas [17] to extract attack paths, and it was
visualised using the Gephi tool [6] to analyse the attacks
as directed connected graphs. The only post-processing
done in the dataset was the removal of ARP packets since
those only come from the VPS provider‚Äôs local network.
4. Methodology
Throughout this work, the following deÔ¨Ånitions were
used for attack ,attacker andservice :
Attack : an attack is deÔ¨Åned as a network Ô¨Çow
whose destination IP address matches one of the
IPs of the honeypots.
Attacker : an attacker is deÔ¨Åned as the source IP
address in an attack (Ô¨Çow).
Service : a service is deÔ¨Åned as the destination port
of an attack (Ô¨Çow).
The rest of this section presents the main questions
and methods used in this work.
4.1. Where do attacks originate from?
One of the motivations behind the need to know where
attacks come from may be related to the physical-world
assumption that attacks coming from the IP addresses of
a country would be related, or even supported, by the
authorities, companies, or organisations of that country. It
is also related to the need for attribution for attacks. From
a technical perspective, a good attribution may be used to
better understand and proÔ¨Åle the alleged attackers. How-
ever, there are many situations in which the IP address of a
country may not be related to the country itself. Examples
include cloud providers that lease shared IP addresses,
remotely controlled computers, and the creation of fake
traces to be used as false Ô¨Çags.
To analyse the origin of attacks, we Ô¨Årst propose the
new concept Hfor each attacker seen in the dataset. His
deÔ¨Åned as the number of unique honeypots attacked . This
new concept helps focus on the attackers that are inter-
ested in few honeypots or maybe do not have resources
to attack more honeypots, from attackers that are seen in
all honeypots sending a large number of Ô¨Çows.
In our case, His deÔ¨Åned in the range 1<=H < = 8.
Second, we looked up the continent where the IP address
of the attacker was registered using the MaxMind Geo
Lite [16] database. MaxMind uses seven continents andobtains the location by correlating various sources of
data [16]. The precise location of an IP may be inaccurate,
but at a continent level, it is more precise.
The number of attackers per source continent was
calculated as the sum of attackers per source continent,
disaggregated by H(number of unique honeypots at-
tacked). This measures how many attackers originated
from each continent. The number of attacks per source
continent was calculated as the sum of attacks per source
continent, disaggregated by the H. This measures how
many attacks originated from each continent.
The data received in the honeypots was compared to
the expected trafÔ¨Åc for the Internet population. For this
comparison, we used the world percentages of Internet
penetration rate per continent [18]. The values used for
our comparison as of January 2023, are Africa=11.2%,
Asia=58%, Europe=13.9%, South America=9.9%, North
America=6.5%, and Oceania=0.6%. These values repre-
sent the expected average amounts per continent if we
assume that in average , people from each continent attack
approximately the same amount.
4.1.1. Tor proxy attackers. In the case of attackers
hiding their IP address behind proxy servers, VPNs, or
Tor, the analysis is still valid since it focuses on where
attacks come from and not in which is the real country of
the attacker. If a proxy network is used for many attacks,
this is still valid information for the defender.
Tor is the most well-known and used proxy network
with more than 2 million users [15]. It is well known that
attackers often proxy their attacks through it [11], [22]. To
determine the number of attackers proxying their attacks
through the Tor network, we obtained the list of IPs used
as Tor exit nodes in the time frame of the dataset. Tor
publishes monthly lists of exit nodes, each containing the
list of IPs for that day. We downloaded the data for the
months of April, May and June 2021. From these months,
we kept only the data corresponding to the days of the
dataset, from the 23rd of April to the 1st of June 2021.
The resulting data were processed to extract the IPs for
each day, which were then combined and deduplicated to
form a unique list and compared to the dataset.
4.2. How much do attackers attack?
By measuring how much attackers attack, regarding
the number of Ô¨Çows sent, it is possible to deÔ¨Åne policies
that focus on the attackers that are more aggressive ,
persistent orresourceful . This information helps prioritise
resources and focus defence mechanisms.
To answer this question, we calculated the number
of attacks and attackers, disaggregated by H(number of
unique honeypots attacked). The number of attackers per
Hwas calculated as the sum of the number of attackers
that attacked Hhoneypots. The number of attacks per
Hwas calculated as the sum of the number of Ô¨Çows
per attacker that attacked Hhoneypots. Additionally, we
calculated the average, standard deviation and median of
the number of attacks per attacker per H.
4.3. What do attackers attack?
There are two main motivations for studying which
services attackers attack. First, it shows the focus andinterest of attackers, maybe based on the availability of
exploits. This alone sheds light on the attackers‚Äô trends.
Second, if the defenders can choose the port numbers of
their services, learning which ports are attacked less helps
place production services in less attacked ports.
To answer this question, we created the concept of S,
deÔ¨Åned as the number of services attacked per attacker . It
is independent of the number of honeypots attacked ( H)
and can only take the values 1;2;3;4;5andS > 5. The
limit of 5was deÔ¨Åned since preliminary results showed
that the average number of services attacked per attacker
was 5:41. This question refers to services of the TCP and
UDP protocols since other protocols do not have services.
The number of attackers per Swas calculated as
the sum of attackers that attacked Sservices. The number
ofattacks per Swas calculated as the sum of the attacks
per attacker that attacked Sservices. Additionally, we
calculated the average, standard deviation and median of
the number of attacks per attacker per S.
4.4. How attackers attack?
The motivation to understand how attackers attack is
to identify patterns that help better evaluate honeypots
as early warning systems. Understanding how attackers
select servers to attack may help better select the number
and location of honeypots to increase the protection of
production systems.
The mechanism used to analyse how attackers attack
is the sequence of honeypots selected for attack. We want
to understand the order of the sequence and the variations.
If an attacker sends 1,000 Ô¨Çows to honeypot 1 and then
1,000 Ô¨Çows to honeypot 2, then we consider the order
from 1 to 2. We are not interested in the number of Ô¨Çows
but only the sequence of honeypots attacked. An attacker
that sends 3 Ô¨Çows to honeypot 1, 1 Ô¨Çow to honeypot 2,
and 10 Ô¨Çows to honeypot 1 again has the sequence 1,2,1.
For this analysis, we identify each honeypot with a
numeric ID (1 to 8) and for each attacker we computed
the chronologically sorted sequence of honeypot IDs at-
tacked . Then, we Ô¨Ålter out sequences that at least attack
all 8 honeypots. An example sequence for a given source
IP is 7!2!6!4!5!8!1!3!6!4!
8!1!3!7.
As a Ô¨Årst step of the sequence analysis, we grouped
all sequences that share the same starting honeypot ID .
Then we created connected graphs of those sequences.
We ended up with eight graphs, one per starting point.
Those graphs were used to visually inspect the sequence
of honeypots visited by attackers.
In the next step, we used subsequence Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW) as a similarity measure to Ô¨Ånd how often
all the possible permutations of length eight occur within
all the available sequences and if any visible patterns stand
out. DTW [21] is a similarity measure that is used to
compare time series of variable length. The reason to use
DTW is that it allows the matching of variable length time
series, and it also captures contractions or expansions of
time series. For example, a series of honeypot IDs 8!
6!3has zero DTW distance from the sequence 8!
8!8!6!6!6!3!3!3. In our case, this
is a desirable property because an attacker may attack a
honeypot more than once before moving to the next one,e.g., in the case of a vertical port scan. Another desirable
property of subsequence DTW is that it can also capture
cyclic patterns of the form 8!6!3!8!6!3!
8!6!3, which occur if attackers repeatedly follow
the same pattern of attacks.
The underlying measure of distance in DTW is the
euclidean distance. However, the honeypot IDs should be
treated as categorical variables. For our measurements, we
assumed that all the distances between nodes are equal to
one, i.e., the distance between honeypot 8 and honeypot
7 is the same as between honeypot 8 and honeypot 1. To
obtain the distance metrics between sequences, we used
the DTW implementation from the library tslearn [27]
with the modiÔ¨Åcation of using the constant distance be-
tween nodes instead of the Euclidean distance. When we
measured how often a subsequence permutation occurs
within the attacker sequences, we counted only those that
have a distance equal to zero.
4.5. ProÔ¨Åles of attackers
One of this paper‚Äôs most important methodological
outputs is the proposal to create attacker proÔ¨Åles based
on the preliminary results obtained in the analysis of the
number of honeypots attacked ( H) and the number of
services attacked ( S).
The number of honeypots attacked H, is a discreet
number in the range of 1 8. Given that preliminary results
show that most attackers attacked only one honeypot, our
proÔ¨Åles differentiated attackers attacking one honeypot or
more than one honeypot.
The number of attacked services, S, is a discreet
number in the range of 1;2;3;4;5and>5. Given that
preliminary results show that most attackers attack one
service, we simpliÔ¨Åed the proÔ¨Åles to differentiate between
attackers that attacked 1 service or more than 1 service.
Our separation gave rise to four high-level types of
attacker proÔ¨Åles:
Casual Focused : attacks only one honeypot and
only one service ( H= 1,S= 1).
Casual Explorer : attacks only one honeypot and
more than one service ( H= 1,S > 1).
Driven Focused : attacks more than one honeypot
and only one service ( H > 1,S= 1).
Driven Explorer : attacks more than one honeypot
and more than one service ( H > 1,S > 1).
4.6. Benign scanners
By deÔ¨Ånition, all connections to a honeypot are consid-
ered attacks. However, it is widely known that companies,
governments, individuals, and educational institutions ac-
tively and repeatedly scan the Internet to search for known
vulnerabilities or conduct studies [2], [3], [8]. These
are known as benign scanners . To ensure these entities
achieve accurate results, they often do not disclose which
IPs are used to perform the scans. Therefore, it is common
that intelligence collected from honeypots contain benign
IPs that belong to this group.
To measure the number of benign scanners, we col-
lected 8,508 IP addresses associated with known scanners.
These IP addresses were gathered through open-sourceintelligence tools (OSINT) and third-party platforms [1]
during 2023. The collected IPs were compared to the list
of attackers in the dataset.
5. Results
This section presents the results of applying the re-
search methodology deÔ¨Åned in Section 4 to the CTU
Hornet 40 dataset. Considering that only 0.076% of the
attackers in the dataset were identiÔ¨Åed as proxy attackers
attacking through the Tor network, we did not remove
them from the data. This small percentage of attackers
that use Tor as a proxy was also reported in [14].
5.1. Where do attacks originate from?
The number of attackers by source continent are
shown in Table 2. It can be seen that 54.87% of the
total attackers originate from Asia, 16.84% from Europe,
and 15.01% from North America. There were signiÔ¨Åcantly
fewer attacks from the rest of the continents, with 8.14%
coming from South America, 4.58% from Africa, and
0.47% from Oceania. A 0.08% of attackers did not have a
continent associated with their source IPs at the moment
of this study. No attackers were found originating from
Antarctica (ZZ represents no country deÔ¨Åned).
Taking into account the percentage of global Internet
penetration rate, 58% of the attackers are expected to come
from Asia, and our results show 54.87% originate in Asia,
meaning we observed 0.94x than expected. 11.2% of the
attackers are expected to come from Africa, and our results
show 0.47%, meaning we observed 0.04x than expected.
13.9% of the attackers are expected to come from Europe,
and our results show 16.84%, meaning we observed 1.21x
than expected. 9.9% of the attackers are expected to
come from South America, and our results show 4.58%,
meaning we observed 0.46x than expected. 6.5% of the
attackers are expected to come from North America, and
our results show 15.01%, meaning we observed 2.3x than
expected. 0.6% of the attackers are expected to come
from Oceania, and our results show 0.47%, meaning we
observed 0.78x than expected.
Table 2 also shows the percentage of attackers per
continent disaggregated by H(number of honeypots at-
tacked). It can be seen that for all continents, the large
majority of attackers attacked only one honeypot. Even
though the percentage decreases with the number of hon-
eypots attacked, it actually increases for 8 honeypots.
The number of attacks per source continent are
shown in Table 3. It can be seen that 41.74% of total
attacks originate from Asia, 36.12% from Europe, and
19.58% from North America. The number of attacks in the
remaining continents was almost negligible, with 1.48%
of attacks originating from South America, 0.86% from
Africa, and 0.21% from Oceania. A 0.01% of attacks
originated from attackers that did not have a continent
associated with their source IPs at the moment of this
study. No attacks were found originating from Antarctica.
Taking into account the percentage of global Internet
penetration rate (see subsection 4.1), we observed 0.72x
attacks originating in Asia than expected, 0.08x attacks
originating in Africa than expected, 2.6x attacks originat-
ing in Europe than expected, 0.15x attacks originating inTABLE 2: Percentage of attackers per continent disag-

Table 3 shows the origin of attacks disaggregated by
H(number of honeypots attacked). For all the continents,
the majority of attacks go to only one honeypot.
5.2. How much do attackers attack?
The distribution of attackers and attacks disaggre-
gated by H(number of honeypots attacked) is shown
in Table 4, along with the average of attackers per at-
tackers and its respective standard deviation and median.
Our measurements show that 75.80% of attackers in
the dataset attacked only one honeypot, 10.09% of attack-
ers attacked two honeypots, 4.44% of attackers attacked
three honeypots, and 4.03% of attackers attacked all eight

In terms of the number of attacks, 54.15% of the
attacks in the dataset were generated by attackers attacking
only one honeypot, 21.04% was generated by attackers
attacking all eight honeypots, and 8.88% was generated
by attackers attacking six honeypots. Overall, 45.85% of
the attacks were generated by attackers attacking more

As shown in Table 4, the largest variability in the
average of attacks per attacker is observed in attackers that
attack only one honeypot, with 12.78 1051.66 attacks
per attacker and a median of 1. Attackers that attack six
honeypots are those with the highest number of attacks
per attacker, with 152.49 807.74 attacks per attacker and
a median of 11.
5.3. What do attackers attack?
The average number of destination ports attacked per
attacker is 5.44. The distribution of attackers andattacks
disaggregated by H(number of honeypots attacked) and
S(number of services attacked) is presented in Table 5
and Table 6, respectively.
We found that 89% of attackers attacked only one
destination port, 5.31% of attackers attacked two destina-
tion ports, and 3.59% of attackers attacked more than Ô¨Åve
destination ports. Overall, 10.99% of attackers attacked
more than one destination port.
We found that 57.04% of the attacks were generated
by attackers attacking more than Ô¨Åve destination ports,

honeypots by the subset of attackers that attacked all eight

38.30% of the attacks were generated by attackers attack-
ing only one destination port, and 2.37% of the attacks
were generated by attackers attacking only two destina-
tion ports. Overall, 61.46% of attacks were generated by
attackers attacking more than one destination port.
Similarly, the average number of attacks per attacker,
disaggregated by HandSis presented in Table 7. Attack-
ers that attack one honeypot and more than 5 destination
ports are those with the highest average number of attacks
per attacker, with 2,222.12 21,115.40 attacks per attacker
and a median of 16. The highest median number of attacks
per attacker corresponds to the attackers that attacked
more than 5 ports and all 8 honeypots.
5.4. How do attackers attack?
The attack patterns were found by analysing the at-
tackers that attacked all 8 honeypots and extracting the
sequences in which the honeypots were attacked. These
sequences of attacks, built following the steps described
in subsection 4.4, are represented as a directed connected
graph in Figure 1. The edges in the graph are the fre-
quencies of an attacker changing its attention from one
honeypot to another. In the Ô¨Ågure, it can be seen that
certain sequences or loops repeat more than others, such
as those between honeypots 4and 5,1and 2, and 7
and 6. This does not mean that the attacker gets into a
loop but that, on average, the attackers in one honeypot
change focus to the other honeypot with that frequency.
Remember that the frequencies are computed for all the
sequences that pass through that honeypot.
Using the DTW metric, we counted which was the
frequency of each possible subsequence of length eight
appearing in the attackers‚Äô paths. The results can be seen
in Figure 2. The idea is to Ô¨Ånd if the attacker path includes
the same amount of each sequence (a uniform random
selection), or if some sequences are preferred . Preferred
sequences would mean that there is an intentional process
of selection. Most subsequences occur only a few times,
but a few distinct outliers occur more than 100 times.
The eight most frequent occurrences are 7!2!6!
4!5!8!1!3and all its cyclic permutations
such as 2!6!4!5!8!1!3!7and
6!4!5!8!1!3!7!6.TABLE 7: Average attacks per attacker based on the number of attackers that attacked a certain number of honeypots

5.5. ProÔ¨Åles of attackers
The results of the proÔ¨Åles based on attackers and
attacks are shown in Figure 3, separated by H(number of
attacked honeypots) and S(number of attacked services).
This Ô¨Ågure shows the four proÔ¨Åles. At the top left ( H= 1,
S= 1) the Casual focused , at the top right ( H= 1,
S > 1) the Causal explorer , at the bottom left ( H > 1,
S= 1 ) the Driven focused , and at the bottom right
(H > 1,S > 1) the Driven explorer .
According to Figure 3a, 75.96% (73.26% + 2.7%) of
the total attackers can be labelled as Casual , attacking
only one honeypot. From the total, 24.04% (15.74% +
8.3%) can be labelled as Driven , attacking more than
one honeypot. From the perspective of the number of
destination ports attacked, 89% (75.26 % + 15.74%) of the
attackers can be labelled as Focused , attacking only one
destination port. From the total, 11% (2.7% + 8.3%) of
the attackers can be labelled as Explorer , attacking more
than one destination port.
From the total attackers, 73.26% can be proÔ¨Åled as
Casual focused , attacking only one honeypot and onedestination port. Casual focused attackers are responsible
for 31.3% of the total attacks in the dataset. Casual
focused attackers found to originate from Tor exit nodes
were 0.053%.
From the total attackers, 15.74% can be proÔ¨Åled as
Driven focused , attacking more than one honeypot and
one destination port. Driven focused attackers are respon-
sible for 7% of the total attacks. Driven focused attackers
found to originate from Tor exit nodes were 0.007%.
From the total attackers, 2.7% can be proÔ¨Åled as Ca-
sual explorer , attacking one honeypot and more than one
destination port. Casual explorer attackers are responsible
for 24.3% of the total attacks. Casual explorer attackers
found to originate from Tor exit nodes were 0.002%.
From the total attackers, 8.3% can be proÔ¨Åled as
Driven explorer , attacking more than one honeypot and
more than one destination port. Driven explorer attackers
are responsible for 37.4% of the total attacks. Driven
explorer attackers found to originate from Tor exit nodes
were 0.014%.
5.6. Benign scanners
Benign scanners account for 0.63% of the total number
of attackers in the dataset. Broken down by the proposed
proÔ¨Åles, 0.42% of the benign scanner attackers fall in the
driven explorer proÔ¨Åle, 0.17% in the casual focused pro-
Ô¨Åle, 0.03% in the casual explorer proÔ¨Åle and 0.01% in the
driven focused proÔ¨Åle. Overall, 3.25% of the total attacks
in the dataset can be associated with benign scanners.
6. Analysis
Trying to understand the results obtained by process-
ing a large amount of data requires a strong focus on what
needs to be answered. This section analyses the original
questions and focuses on the results that help answer them.
6.1. Where do attacks originate from?
Despite the probably unaccounted seasonal aspects of
the dataset, our analysis shows that the majority of the
attackers seen in the dataset (in total numbers) originate
from Asia. Attackers originating in Asia seem more spe-
cialised, with the majority attacking only one honeypot.
However, compared with the expected attacks by Internet
population, Asia actually sends fewer attacks than ex-
pected, and North America sends 2.3x more attacks than
expected, with Europe sending 1.21x times more. This
is important to put in context the results regarding the
number of people connected and not only the raw attacks.
Most of the attackers attack one honeypot indepen-
dently of the continent of origin . The number of attack-
ers then decreases as the number of attacked honeypots
increases. However, there is in general a higher number
of attackers when attackers attack all eight honeypots .
Attackers from Africa and South America may appear
more efÔ¨Åcient in their attacks, as they generate fewer
attacks. 4.58% of attackers originating from Africa gen-
erate only 0.86% of the total attacks. Similarly, 8.14%
of attackers originating in South America generate only
1.48% of the total attacks. In contrast, attackers fromEurope and North America appear more aggressive in
their attacks, generating a larger number of attacks per
attacker. This is also sustained by the normalised results,
in which Europe and North America show more attackers
and attacks than expected when taking into account the
percentage of global Internet penetration rate.
6.2. How much do attackers attack?
Our research shows that honeypots used as early warn-
ing systems may be overrated. This is because 75.80% of
attackers attack only one honeypot. This means that if we
take one attacker IP address from this group and add it
to a blocklist in a production server, the likelihood of it
blocking any trafÔ¨Åc is very low.
The median of the attackers that connect to only
one honeypot ( H= 1) also only sends one Ô¨Çow (one
attack). This can be seen in Table 4 where the median
is 1. The high standard deviation can be explained by a
few attackers that scan all 65,535 TCP ports in some
honeypots, generating over half a million attacks.
Attackers that attack 6 or more honeypots had the
largest median of attacks per attacker (median 11, 16 and
22 for 6, 7 and 8 honeypots). High standard deviations
are caused by some attackers scanning more than others.
6.3. What do attackers attack?
Attackers show a high degree of specialisation, with
89% of attackers attacking one service. Which ports at-
tackers attack may be useful for defence independently of
how many honeypots are targeted. The high specialisation
can be driven by how attackers operate. For example, SSH
brute-forcing botnets are in this group, attacking to Ô¨Ånd
servers with weak credentials.
Attackers also show specialisation in the type of ap-
plication targeted. 5.31% of attackers target two services.
Here we Ô¨Ånd attackers targeting, for example, the two
most common TELNET ports: 23and2323 , similarly,
forSSH,FTP and others.
6.4. How do attackers attack?
Attackers that attack all eight honeypots ( H= 8) are
of special interest, as they have time and resources to
attack all of the Internet and do so repeatedly. Internet-
wide scans may take a long time, depending on the tools
used and the type of activities done. Our results show
two prominent attacking patterns, attackers attacking in
ascending order and those attacking in descending order.
Many attacker IPs matching these patterns were known in
the community for performing brute-forcing attacks. None
of these attackers was found to be a benign scanner, and
only one was an attacker proxying its attacks through Tor.
One niche of attackers attacks the honeypots sequen-
tially in ascending order . They attack, for example, IP
3.3.3.3, before IP 4.4.4.4. Figure 4 shows how these at-
tackers start by attacking honeypot 7, which has the lowest
IP address number, and move subsequently to other hon-
eypots that have a higher IP address number. The graph
shown in Figure 4 was Ô¨Åltered to only show signiÔ¨Åcant
edges in the graph. This pattern was also conÔ¨Årmed using75

the DTW metric to measure occurrences of subsequences.
An example of the type of matches captured by DTW that
would not be possible to do without string manipulation
is shown in Figure 5.
Another niche of attackers, smaller in size, attacks the
honeypots sequentially but in descending order . These
attackers start by attacking honeypot 1, which has the
highest IP address number, and subsequently move to
other honeypots that have a lower IP address number. This
pattern was also conÔ¨Årmed using the DTW metric.
Attackers attacking in ascending order are ideal to
be used in early warning systems, suggesting that placing
a honeypot in the lowest possible IP address and a
production server in the highest possible IP address
might maximise the available warning time.
6.5. ProÔ¨Åles of attackers
We have identiÔ¨Åed four attacker proÔ¨Åles that we have
characterised as casual vsdriven andfocused vsexplorer .
Casual attackers may become driven attackers over time
as more data is being captured. Focused attackers may
become explorers for the same reason. However, once anattacker has been proÔ¨Åled as driven or explorer, it stays
as such for the duration of the study.
Our analysis shows a clear distinction between casual
vs driven attackers. Casual attackers are low-scale attack-
ers conÔ¨Åned, probably, to speciÔ¨Åc countries or IP ranges
and are not likely to attack globally. Most attackers are ca-
sual attackers that attack less than driven attackers. Driven
attackers are large-scale attackers with resources to attack
globally and repeatedly. Driven attackers attack more on
average, but given their reduced numbers, they generate
fewer attacks than casual attackers. Driven attackers are
of particular interest as they are likely to attack other
systems, making them good candidates for blocking.
A clear distinction was also found between focused
vs explorer attackers. Focused attackers are very spe-
cialised, with a service-oriented interest. In contrast, ex-
plorer attackers have a wider and host-centric interest,
often attacking groups of services. Explorer attackers are
considerably fewer in numbers than focused attackers but
are responsible for 61.7% of attacks.
6.5.1. Casual focused attackers. These attackers attack
only one honeypot and one destination port. They prefer
to attack speciÔ¨Åc regions or countries instead of glob-
ally. They have a service-oriented interest. They may
not conduct more widespread attacks due to a lack of
resources, time, patience, or interest. Among these may be
individuals attempting to discover lost servers, conducting
research studies, and certain bots.
According to this study, 73.26% of the observed at-
tackers can be proÔ¨Åled as casual focused attackers. These
attackers are not likely to attack another honeypot, mak-
ing blocking these IPs less relevant . These attackers
are not likely to attack another destination port, however,
capturing this information may be valuable to evaluate in
which ports to place honeypots.
Only 0.17% of the total attackers were found to be ca-
sual focused attackers and benign scanners. Our analysis
shows these are often associated with two types of benign
scanning entities. One type owns large IP ranges and
distributes its scanning activities by assigning a destination
IP range and service per source IP. The second type may
own smaller IP ranges but performs surgical Internet-wide
scans, targeting one service at a time. This second type
may turn into driven or explorer attackers over time.
6.5.2. Casual explorer attackers. Casual explorer at-
tackers attack only one honeypot and more than one
destination port. These attackers prefer to attack speciÔ¨Åc
regions or countries instead of globally. They have a wider
interest in terms of services targeted, often displaying an
interest in the targeted host instead of the services them-
selves. Among these may be people testing tools, certain
bots targeting a family of services (e.g., web services may
be deployed in ports 80/TCP, 443/TCP and others), and
smaller companies focused on a regional threat landscape.
A 2.7% of the attackers can be proÔ¨Åled as casual ex-
plorer attackers responsible for 24.3% of the total attacks
observed in the dataset. These attackers are not likely to
attack other honeypots, hence using these IPs for blocking
would not provide much value. These attackers may attack
other services over time, providing good intelligence on
where to place services to capture or avoid attacks.Only 0.03% of the total attackers were found to be
casual explorer andbenign scanners. These are often host-
discovery scanning entities focused on the most common
services attempting to discover new hosts online.
6.5.3. Driven focused attackers. Driven focused attack-
ers attack more than one honeypot and only one des-
tination port. These attackers attack globally and have
aservice-oriented interest. These large-scale attackers
have resources and time. Among these, we expect to Ô¨Ånd
attackers that own exploits and look for online services
to exploit, benign scanning entities attempting to map
the global threat landscape, and some narrow-focused IoT
botnets and malware.
Of the total attackers, 15.74% can be proÔ¨Åled as driven
focused attackers. The narrow focus of the attacks gener-
ated by driven focused attackers can be seen represented
in the volume of attacks associated with them, only 7% of
the total attacks. These attackers are likely to attack other
honeypots making their IP addresses a good addition to
any blocklist and can be used as an early warning system.
Of the total attackers, 0.01% were found to be driven
focused and benign scanners. We believe these are spe-
cialised benign scanners focused on mapping the global
status of speciÔ¨Åc services.
6.5.4. Driven explorer attackers. Driven explorer at-
tackers attack more than one honeypot and more than
one destination port. These attackers attack globally and
show a host-oriented interest. These large-scale attackers
have resources and time. Among these, we Ô¨Ånd the bulk
of the IoT botnets, wide network attacks, and benign
scanners. These attackers are worth observing, collecting
intelligence from, and stopping in production.
Of the total attacker, 8.3% can be proÔ¨Åled as driven
explorer attackers. The wide interest of these attackers can
be seen in the volume of attacks they generate, as high
as 37.4% of the total attacks. This also means that these
attackers may attack more honeypots and services and
attack repeatedly. The IP addresses and services associated
with these attackers should have high value in preventing
attacks on production servers.
Of the total attackers, 0.42% were found to be driven
explorer and benign scanners. This is how benign scan-
ners are expected to behave. Our analysis shows that under
this proÔ¨Åle, we Ô¨Ånd the bulk of IP addresses associated
with well-known benign scanners such as ShadowServer,
Censys, Shodan, Google and others.
7. Recommendations
Defenders interested in using honeypot data on IPs
and services as intelligence in early warning systems for
protecting production services should focus on driven
focused anddriven explorer attackers. With at least two
geographically dispersed honeypots, it is possible to iden-
tify these attackers and block them in a production system.
Defenders interested in mapping and studying internet
attacks globally should deploy geographically dispersed
honeypots. The number of honeypots deployed will impact
the total information collected for statistics. But not all
attackers and attacks should be taken to have a global
impact.Defenders interested in learning which ports should
be avoided for production services should focus on ca-
sual explorer and driven explorer attackers. One or more
honeypots should allow identifying these attackers.
8. Limitations and Future Work
One key limitation of this work is the use of a dataset
of passive honeypots network trafÔ¨Åc. Previous work re-
marks on the importance of interaction in honeypots,
which needs to be considered. We aim to address this in
future work by expanding our analysis to other datasets.
Additionally, the dataset comprises only IPv4 network
data; future work will attempt to perform similar measure-
ments, including IPv6 addresses. At the moment, attackers
do not seem to be using IPv6 extensible, so we believe
the measurement of attacks did not lose relevance.
Future work will include a comprehensive veriÔ¨Åcation
of proxy servers to quantify the attackers actively trying
to hide their origin through reverse DNS and other tech-
niques. Comparing the results with other existing datasets
in the area is also part of our future work, to help validate
the results obtained in this research.
9. Conclusions
This research explored attack patterns in a network
dataset of eight geographically dispersed honeypots driven
by four core questions: where do attacks originate from
and how much, what, and how do attackers attack? The an-
swers to these questions were used to create four attackers‚Äô
proÔ¨Åles. Ultimately, we explored the results to answer Ô¨Ånd
out how important the role played geolocation in honeypot
placement, speciÔ¨Åcally when it comes to using honeypots
as early warning systems.
Through behavioural analysis, we created four attacker
proÔ¨Åles that led to a better understanding of the value of
the information collected from honeypots and its usability
for defence purposes. Our research shows that driven
explorer attackers have more attacking power, displaying
more attacks per attacker overall. These attackers are
worth observing, collecting intelligence from, and stop-
ping in production.
Further study of these behavioural proÔ¨Åles led to iden-
tifying two prominent attack patterns for driven explorer
attackers, those attacking the Internet sequentially in as-
cending order and those attacking the Internet sequentially
in descending other.
Analysis indicates that as few as two distributed hon-
eypots can be useful in helping organisations identify the
most aggressive and driven attackers and efÔ¨Åciently defend
their production servers against them.
Finally, more research needs to be done to evaluate
how honeypot software affects the inÔ¨Çux of attacks on
honeypots over time. The identiÔ¨Åcation and proÔ¨Åling of
benign scanners can also signiÔ¨Åcantly help increase the
quality of the data collection from honeypots and deserves
further study.
