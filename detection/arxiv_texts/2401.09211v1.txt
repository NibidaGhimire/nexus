A sample mixture of alkali homonuclear dimers, Ak 2and Ak′
2and heteronuclear dimers, AkAk′,
residing on the surface of helium nanodroplets are Coulomb exploded into pairs of atomic alkali cations,
(Ak+,Ak+), (Ak′+,Ak′+), (Ak+,Ak′+), following double ionization induced by an intense 50 fs laser
pulse. The measured kinetic energy distribution P(Ekin) of both the Ak+and the Ak′+fragment ions
contains overlapping peaks due to contributions from Coulomb explosion of the homonuclear and the
heteronuclear dimers. Using a coincident filtering method based on the momentum division between
the two fragment ions in each Coulomb explosion event, we demonstrate that the individual P(Ekin)
pertaining to the ions from either the heteronuclear or from the homonuclear dimers can be retrieved,
for both the Ak+and for the Ak′+fragment ions. This filtering method works through the concurrent
detection of two-dimensional velocity images of the Ak+and the Ak′+ions implemented through the
combination of a velocity map imaging spectrometer and a TPX3CAM detector. The key finding is
thatP(Ekin) for heteronuclear alkali dimers can be distinguished despite the simultaneous presence
of homonuclear dimers. From P(Ekin) we determine the distribution of internuclear distances P(R)
via the Coulomb explosion imaging principle. We report results for LiKand for NaK but our method
should should also work for other heteronuclear dimers and for differentiating between different
isotopologues of homonuclear dimers.
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Nanometer-sized droplets of liquid helium provide a
unique medium for studying structure and dynamics of
atoms, molecules and clusters [ 1–5]. While most of such
dopants are located in the interior of the droplets, alkali
atoms and small clusters thereof take a special role by
residing on the droplet surface [ 6–12]. Notably alkali
dimers and trimers have been extensively investigated for
more than 25 years. Experimentally, the main methods
used was absorption spectroscopy in which pulsed or
continuous wave laser beams excited the dimers or trimers
electronically with vibrational state resolution. It was
such experimental studies that established that the dimers
and trimers reside on the surface and, furthermore, that
the dimers are mainly formed in the lowest-lying triplet
state and the trimers in the lowest-lying quartet state [ 13–
19].
Recently, it was demonstrated that Coulomb explosion
induced by irradiation with an intense femtosecond laser
pulse provides an alternative way to explore alkali dimers
and trimers, for instance Na2andNa3, made of a single
alkali species [ 20,21]. The idea of the method in the
case of an alkali dimer, the main topic of this paper, is
the following, see also Fig. 1. First, the dimer is doubly
ionized through multiphoton absorption from an intense
fs laser pulse typically with a central wavelength around
800 nm. Second, the resulting dication Ak2+

Since the double ionization process removes the two va-
lence electrons, Ak2+
2has a closed-shell structure and
therefore it is formed in only one state. As such, there is
only a single, repulsive potential curve VdicatforAk2+
2.
For the equilibrium internuclear distances of Ak2in either
the 11Σ+
gor in the 13Σ+
ustate, Vdicat is, to a good
approximation, given by a Coulomb potential:
Vdicat≈VCoul=14.4 eV
R(˚A)+ 2Ip(Ak), (2)
see Fig. 1, where Ip(Ak) is the ionization potential of Ak.
The single potential curve ensures a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the initial internuclear distance Rof
the dimer and the final kinetic energy Ekinof each of the
Ak+fragment ions. If the dimer is made up of two alkali
atoms with the same mass, for instance39K2, then energy
and momentum conservation leads to Ekin=7.2 eV
R(˚A)in
the Coulomb potential approximation. One useful con-
sequence of the one-to-one ( R,Ekin) correspondence is
that measurement of Ekinmakes it possible to distinguish
between Ak2in the 11Σ+
gand in the 13Σ+
ustate [ 20].
It was found that dimers are preferentially formed in the
13Σ+
ustate. The quantum state sensitivity was exploited
to record laser-induced nonadiabatic alignment dynamics
of alkali homonuclear dimers in both the triplet and in
the singlet state [ 22]. With this method the distribu-
tion of internuclear distances P(R) for the dimers in the
two quantum states can also be determined [ 21]. ThisarXiv:2401.09211v1  [physics.atm-clus]  17 Jan 20242

approach has been extended to fs time-resolved measure-
ments of P(R) for vibrating dimers [23].
In the current work, we explore Coulomb explosion
of heteronuclear alkali dimers, AkAk′, on the surface
of helium droplets, where Ak and Ak′are two different
alkali atoms, for instance Li and K. At first, it may seem
like a straightforward extension of the former work on
homonuclear dimers but due to the way the heteronuclear
dimers are created, this is not the case. In practice, an
AkAk′dimer is formed by passing He droplets through
two serially arranged pickup cells. A droplet can then
pick up an Ak atom in the first cell and an Ak′atom
in the second cell, which may lead to the formation of a
AkAk′heteronuclear dimer. The statistical nature of the
pickup process implies, however, that some droplets pick
up two Ak atoms or two Ak′atoms leading to formation
of an Ak2or an Ak′
2homonuclear dimer [26, 27].
For the Coulomb explosion technique the complication
of a mixed sample is that both the Ak+and the Ak′+frag-
ment ions contain contributions from Coulomb explosion
of the homonuclear dimers as well as of the heteronuclear
dimer. The fragment ions originating from the homonu-
clear dimers and from the heteronuclear dimer will, in
most cases, have overlapping kinetic energy distributions
and, as a result, the one-to-one correspondence between
EkinandRis lost. Thus, the directly measured kinetic
energy distribution may no longer be useful for identifyingthe quantum states of the dimer or for retrieving P(R).
The purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible
to extract the kinetic energy distribution P(Ekin) of the
fragment ions for both the homonuclear dimers and for
the heteronuclear dimer. Hereby it becomes possible to
determine P(R) for the heteronuclear dimer.
II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
Figure 2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup.
Its description here is brief since a detailed account was
already given in Ref. [ 21]. A continuous beam of He
droplets is produced by expanding a helium gas at a
stagnation pressure of 50 bar at a temperature of 16
K into vacuum. The average radius of the droplets is
∼5 nm corresponding to ∼104He atoms in each droplet [ 8].
The droplet beam passes through two successive pickup
cells. The first (second) contains a gas of Ak (Ak′) atoms.
The vapor pressure in the cells is adjusted such that
some of the droplets pick up two alkali atoms resulting
in the formation of either an Ak 2, an Ak′
2or an AkAk′
dimer. Afterwards, the doped He droplet beam enters a
velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer consisting of a
repeller (R), extractor (E), and a ground (G) electrode.
The droplet beam is crossed by a single, focused laser
beam in between the repeller and the extractor electrodes.
The laser beam contains linearly polarized pulses with a
duration of 50 fs (FWHM), a central wavelength of 800
nm, and an intensity of 1 .3×1014W/cm2. The pulses are
used to double ionize the alkali dimers and thereby induce
Coulomb explosion. The Ak+andAk′+fragment ions
are projected onto a position sensitive detector backed
by a TPX3CAM detector [ 28–30] synchronized to the 1
kHz repetition rate of the laser pulses. The TPX3CAM
allows us to determine the two-dimensional velocity and
the time-of-flight of each ion hit. Due to the high time
resolution (better than 2 ns) of the TPX3CAM, the time-
of-flight measurements enable the simultaneous recording
of the 2D velocity images of both the Ak+and the Ak′+
ions [ 31,32]. This is crucial for the implementation of the
coincident filtering of the fragment ions. The 2D velocity
images constitute the basic experimental observables.

ing cell contained Li (K) vapor, as indicated on Fig. 2(a).

time-walk corrected, then clustered and centroided, and
finally time-walk corrected again, in a procedure very sim-
ilar to the one described in Ref. [ 30]. A publicly available
custom implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm (see
Data Availability) makes this post processing run approx-
imately ten times faster than the data acquisition. The
result is a list of ion hits, recording the two components of
projected velocity, the time-of-flight and the correspond-
ing lasershot number for each. The mass-to-charge is
then calculated for each hit, and binned in a histogram
to give the spectrum seen in Figure 2(b). The two peaks
of interest are the ones with m/q = 7 and m/q = 39,
assigned as7Li+and39K+ions, respectively [ 33]. The
peak at m/q = 18 comes from H2O+ions created by
multiphoton ionization of residual water molecules in the
target chamber housing the VMI spectrometer.
The 2D velocity image of Li+ions, displayed in
Fig. 3(a1), exhibits pronounced signal in the central region
and in the outer region. The radial velocity distribution
in the detector plane, P(vr), obtained by angular integra-
tion of the image, shows that the outer region consists
of two overlapping peaks centered at vr= 6.8 km/s and
atvr= 8.1 km/s, see Fig. 3(a2). Similarly, two peaks
appear in the kinetic energy distribution P(Ekin) of the
Li+ions, Fig. 3(a3), obtained by first Abel inverting the
2D image using the POP algorithm [ 34], and then apply-
ing a Jacobian transformation to the resulting velocity
distribution [ 20]. The central positions of the peaks are
1.69 eV and 2.38 eV. The lower value matches the kinetic
energy a Li+ion acquires upon Coulomb explosion of Li2
in the 13Σ+
ustate, as established by recent studies on
samples with only Li2[20].To confirm this interpretation, we determined the co-
variance map of the radial velocity distribution [ 35], de-
noted as cov( vr,vr) and displayed in Fig. 3(a4). The
symmetric, elongated signal that peaks at at (6.8 km/s,
6.8 km/s) shows that Li+ions with this speed or, equiv-
alently, with Ekinaround 1.69 eV are correlated with
another Li+ion having the same speed – or kinetic energy.
Only double ionization of Li2and subsequent Coulomb
explosion of Li2+
2can create such a pair of correlated Li+
ions. For completeness, we also determined the angular
covariance map [ 36–39] of these Li+ions, using the angu-
lar probability distribution in the detector plane for ions
withvrbetween 5.3 and 7.6 km/s. The result, displayed in
Fig. 3(a5) exhibits two distinct diagonal lines centered at
θ2=θ1±180◦, where θi,i= 1,2 is the angle between an
ion hit and the vertical center line, Fig. 3(a1). These lines
demonstrate correlation between two Li+ions recoiling
with a relative angle of 180◦. Again, such a correlation
confirms that the ions originate from Coulomb explosion.
Finally, we note that the signal in the central area of the
image comes from dissociative ionization of dimers and
possibly from Li+ions formed by ionization of Liatoms
on droplets that picked up only a single Liatom. Isolated
Liatoms that diffused into the VMI spectrometer will
also be ionized. As this signal is rather intense it has
been removed from the image, shown by the elongated
rectangle.
The results for the K+ions, displayed in Fig. 3(b1)-
(b5), are similar to the Li+results. In the 2D velocity
image, Fig. 3(b1), there is a strong signal in the central
region, again ascribed to atomic ionization and dissocia-
tive ionization, and then there are two main channels4

at larger radii. These channels are more separated than
in the Li+case, which can also be seen in P(vr), where
two distinct peaks, centered at vr= 1.4 km/s and at
vr= 2.5 km/s, stand out, Fig. 3(b2), and in P(Ekin) with
one peak at 0.42 eV and another at 1.23 eV, Fig. 3(b3).
The latter kinetic energy matches that of K+ions from
Coulomb explosion of K2in the 13Σ+
ustate. Like the Li+
case, the symmetrically positioned island in the covari-
ance map of the radial velocity distribution at (2.5 km/s,
2.5 km/s), Fig. 3(b4), confirms Coulomb explosion of K2
13Σ+
udimers as the origin of these ions and so does the
diagonal stripes in the corresponding angular covariance
map, Fig. 3(b5).
Now we discuss the origin of the peak at Ekin= 2.38 eV
inP(Ekin) for Li+and the peak at Ekin= 0.42 eV in
P(Ekin) for K+. The equilibrium internuclear distance of
LiKin the 13Σ+
ustate is 4.97 ˚A [40]. If this heteronuclear
dimer is doubly ionized, the resulting LiK2+dication
is created with a potential energy of 2.90 eV, in the
Coulomb potential approximation, compared to a Li+,
K+ion pair at infinite distance. Upon Coulomb explosion,
theLi+ion ends with Ekin= 2.46 eV and the K+ion
with Ekin= 0.44 eV due to conservation of momentum.
These two values are very close to the center values of
the two above mentioned peaks in P(Ekin) for Li+and
K+, respectively. Thus, we interpret the 2.38 eV peak in
P(Ekin) for Li+and the 0.42 eV peak in P(Ekin) for K+
as originating from laser-induced Coulomb explosion of
LiK in the 13Σ+state into a (Li+,K+) pair.
To corroborate this interpretation, we determine the

between the Li+ions and the K+ions. (b) Covariance map of
the angular distribution between the Li+ions with 7.5 km/s

covariance map of the radial velocity distribution for the
Li+and the K+ions, see Fig. 4(a). The strong covariance
signal centered at (8.1 km/s, 1.4 km/s) shows that a
Li+with vraround 8.1 km/s is correlated with a K+ion
with vraround 1.4 km/s. This can also be formulated
as when a Li+ion with Ekin= 2.38 eV is detected, it
is likely to also detect a K+ion wih Ekin= 0.42 eV.
The only way to produce such a correlated ( Li+,K+)
ion pair is through double ionization of LiKin the 13Σ+
state and subsequent Coulomb explosion of the LiK2+
dication. As for the homonuclear dimers, we determined5

the covariance map between the angular distribution of
theLi+ions pertaining to the 2.38 eV peak and the K+
ions in the 0.42 eV peak. The covariance map, displayed
in Fig. 4(b), shows correlation at a relative emission angle
of 180◦as expected for Coulomb explosion of LiK.
2. Coincident filtering: Separation of fragment ions from
homonuclear and heteronuclear dimers
So far we have shown that laser-induced Coulomb ex-
plosion reveals the presence of both homonuclear and
heteronuclear dimers in our sample. Now we discuss how
coincident filtering allows the separation of the Li+(K+)
fragment ions that originate from either Li2(K2) or from
LiKparent dimers. The filter relies on the exact divi-
sion of momentum amongst the two fragment ions in the
Coulomb explosion of a dimer. Thus, the filter for Li2
(K2) works by determining those Li+ions that, within
the same laser shot, are detected along with another Li+
(K+) ion having the diametrical momentum vector. Such
ions can only be produced by Coulomb explosion of Li2
(K2), i.e., the filter discards Li+(K+) produced from
Coulomb explosion of either LiKdimers or of Li3(K3),
Li2K,LiK2trimers [ 41], and from dissociative ionization
of either Li2(K2) or of LiK. Likewise, the filter for LiK
acts by determining the Li+ions that, within the same
laser shot, are detected along with a K+ion having the
opposite momentum.
In practice, the filter is implemented in a polar co-
ordinate system covering the detector plane, see Fig. 5.
Two Li+ions are considered coincident if the following
conditions are fulfilled
|θ1(Li+)−θ2(Li+)−180◦|<15◦
|vr,1(Li+)−vr,2(Li+)|<1.3 km/s ,(3)
where lower index 1 and 2 refer to two different Li+ions.Equation 3 defines the filter for identifying a Li2homonu-
clear dimer. The tolerances of the filter are chosen to
encompass the full covariance lines seen in Fig. 3(a4) and
(a5). Similarly, the filter for identifying a K2homonuclear
dimer is defined by:
|θ1(K+)−θ2(K+)−180◦|<15◦
|vr,1(K+)−vr,2(K+)|<0.6 km/s ,(4)
and the filter for identifying the LiKheteronuclear dimer:
|θ(K+)−θ(Li+)−180◦|<20◦
|mK
mLivr(K+)−vr(Li+)|<1.3 km/s ,(5)
when detecting Li ions, and,
|θ(K+)−θ(Li+)−180◦|<20◦
|vr(K+)−mLi
mKvr(Li+)|<0.6 km/s ,(6)
when detecting K+ions. Here, mK= 39 u and mLi=
7 u. The mass ratios are needed, as the even momentum
sharing results in two ions with different speeds.
Now we apply the Li2coincidence filter, Eq. 3, to
theLi+ions detected and determine P(Ekin) from those
ions that passed the filter. The result is shown by the
full black curve in Fig. 6(b1). As a reference, we plot
P(Ekin) for Li+ions, blue dashed curve, recorded with
an empty potassium pickup cell, i.e., the helium droplets
only picked up Liatoms and thus the only dimers formed
were Li2. The good agreement between the two curves
demonstrates the desired effect of the filter to select the
fragment ions corresponding to a particular dimer species,
in this case Li2, from the mixed sample. Note that P(Ekin)
obtained via the coincidence filter exhibits only a single
peak corresponding to dimers in the 13Σ+
ustate, i.e.,
there is no evidence of dimers formed in the 11Σ+
gstate,
an observation consistent with previous experiments on
samples of pure Li2dimers [19–21].
In a similar manner, we apply the K2coincidence filter,
Eq. 4, to the K+ions detected and determine P(Ekin)
from the ions that passed this filter. The result is shown
by the full black curve in Fig. 6(b2). Again, we include a
reference result, blue dashed curve, depicting P(Ekin) for
K+ions originating from helium droplets doped only with
potassium. The good agreement between the two curves
shows that we can select the K+ions pertaining to the
K2dimers from the mixed sample. Note that in addition
to the main peak, centered at 1.23 eV, corresponding
to dimers in the 13Σ+
ustate, there is a smaller peak
centered at 1.70 eV. The latter is assigned to K2dimers
in the 11Σ+
gstate. This is also consistent with previous
experiments on samples of pure K2dimers [20, 21].
Having established that the coincidence filtering
method works well for retrieving P(Ekin) for Coulomb
explosion of both Li2andK2in the mixed sample, we
assume that it will also work well for retrieving the signal
from the heteronuclear dimer. Thus, we apply the LiK6

coincidence filter to both the Li+ions, Eq. 5, and to the
K+ions, Eq. 6, and determine P(Ekin) in both cases. The
results are displayed in Fig. 6(c1) and (c2). The curves
reach their maxima at 2.38 eV and 0.42 eV, respectively,
very close to the values 2.46 eV and 0.44 eV expected
for fragmentation of the LiK2+dication via a Coulomb
potential starting from the equilibrium distance of dimers
in the 13Σ+state. Both kinetic energy distributions
display only a single peak indicating that the formation
ofLiKdimers in the singlet state is insignificant under
our current experimental conditions.
3. Distribution of internuclear distances for LiK
In the former studies on Coulomb explosion of the
homonuclear alkali dimers, the distribution of internuclear
distances P(R) was determined from P(Ekin) via the ( R,
Ekin) relation using either the Coulomb potential for the
dications or a more accurate potential from quantum
chemistry calculations. For Li2,K2andRb2in the 13Σ+
u
state, it was found that the center of the measured P(R)
was within 0.05 ˚A of the center of the square of the wave
function |Ψ(R)|2for the vibrational ground state, whereas
the FWHM of P(R) was about a factor of 2 larger than
that of |Ψ(R)|2[21].
In the case of LiK, it should be possible to determine
P(R) from either the Li+fragment ions or from the K+
fragment ions. In Fig. 7, the red dotted curve and the
black dashed curve show P(R) obtained from P(Ekin)
FIG. 7. The distribution of internuclear distances for LiK

and from the Li+fragment ions (dotted red curve). The full

for the Li+ions and from the K+ions, respectively. As
a reference we also plot |Ψ(R)|2, the blue full curve ob-
tained by solving the stationary vibrational Schr¨ odinger
equation with the internuclear potential from the litera-
ture [ 40]. First, we note that PLi(R) and PK(R), where
the lower index labels which ion fragment the distribution
is obtained from, have almost the same center positions,
5.10˚A and 5.14 ˚A, i.e. values that are very close to that
of the center of |Ψ(R)|2, 5.04 ˚A. Second, we note that the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of PK(R), 1.5 ˚A, is
significantly larger than the FWHM of PLi(R), 0.86 ˚A.
If the kinetic energy distributions measured for the
two fragments, PK(Ekin) and PLi(Ekin), were solely de-
termined by |Ψ(R)|2, then PK(R) and PLi(R) would be
identical. This is, however, not the case. As discussed
in Ref. [ 21], the kinetic energy distributions are broad-
ened by various experimental factors such as the energy
resolution of the VMI spectrometer and nuclear motion
in the double ionization process. Since the K+andLi+
ions share the momentum equally in the Coulomb ex-
plosion, the K+fragment acquires only 7/46 of the total
Coulomb energy whereas the Li+fragment acquires a frac-
tion of 39/46. Thus, in the transformation of the initial
probability distribution P(Ekin) to the final probability
distribution P(R) any broadening of P(Ekin) will be am-
plified much more (by a factor of 39/7) for the K+case
as compared to the Li+case. This explains why PK(R)
is broader than PLi(R). For comparison, the FWHM of
|Ψ(R)|2is 0.50 ˚A, i.e., the FWHM of PLi(R) is about 70%
larger than this value.7

B. Doping with Na and K atoms
To test our method for a case where the peaks in
the kinetic energy spectrum of the fragment ions from
the homonuclear and heteronuclear dimers overlap more
strongly than in the Li-K case, we carried out measure-
ments on a mixed sample of Na2,K2andNaK. This was
obtained by having a Na vapor in the first and a K vapor
in the second pickup cell.
Figure 8(a1) shows P(Ekin) for the Na+ions obtained
directly from the 2D image, i.e., without any coincident
filtering. The 2D velocity images, radial velocity distri-
butions and covariance maps, similar to those for the
Li-K case displayed in Fig. 3 and in Fig. 4, are given in
the appendix. The kinetic energy spectrum is dominated
by a large peak centered at 1.41 eV and a small peak
centered at 2.13 eV. Unlike the Li-K case, the major peak
at 1.41 eV is not split in two. However, upon application
of first the Na2filter, full black curve in Fig. 8(b1), and
then the NaK filter, Fig. 8(c1), it appears that the 1.41 eV
peak is indeed made up of two contributions. In analogy
with the analysis of the Li-K data, the full black curve in
Fig. 8(b1) should represent P(Ekin) for Na2. The good
agreement with the dashed blue curve, showing P(Ekin)
forNa+ions from droplets that only picked up Naatoms
(empty Kpickup cell) supports the accuracy and intended
effect of the filter. The curve in Fig. 8(c1) should then be
P(Ekin) for NaK. This assignment is consistent with the
fact that the peak position, 1.68 eV is very close to the
value, 1.65 eV, a Na+ion acquires upon Coulomb explo-

sion of NaK in the 13Σ+state. The tiny peak at ∼2.5
eV indicates that a small fraction of the NaK dimers are
formed in the 11Σ+state since Na+ions from Coulomb
explosion of dimers in this state will get a kinetic energy
of 2.6 eV [42].
Figure 8(a2) shows P(Ekin) for the K+ions without any
coincident filtering. A single borad peak is observed with
an indication of a double peak structure. Upon application
of first the K2filter, full black curve in Fig. 8(b2), and
then the NaK filter, Fig. 8(c2) to the K+ions, the two
individual peaks are revealed. Again, we plot P(Ekin)
obtained using droplets that picked up only Katoms,
dashed blue curve in Fig. 8(b2). As for the Na+ions,
there is good agreement with P(Ekin) extracted from the
mixed sample. The majority of the K2dimers are created
in the 13Σ+
ustate (peak at 1.25 eV) although K2in the
11Σ+
gstate are also present (peak at 1.7 eV). Finally,
the peak position of P(Ekin) obtained with the NaK filter
is 1.01 eV, which is close to the value expected for a
K+ion created when NaK at the equilibrium distance of
the 13Σ+state is Coulomb exploded. Overall, the data
presented in Fig. 8 show that for laser-induced Coulomb
explosion of the mixed sample Na2,K2andNaK our
coincident filtering method is capable of extracting the
individual P(Ekin) pertaining to these three dimer species,
unaffected by the strongly overlapping kinetic energy
channels.
At last, we also determine P(R) ofNaK using either
P(Ekin) for the Na+ions or for the K+ions. Figure 9
shows PNa(R), red dotted curve, and PK(R), black dashed8
curve and, as a reference, |Ψ(R)|2for the vibrational
ground state of the 13Σ+state, full blue curve, obtained
by solving the stationary vibrational Schr¨ odinger equation
using the internuclear potential [ 43]. The center positions
ofPNa(R) and of PK(R) are 5.33 ˚Aand 5.28 ˚A, which are
close to the center of |Ψ(R)|2, 5.50 ˚A. The FWHM of
PNa(R) is 0.92 ˚A and 1.1 ˚A for PK(R). This similarity
is expected since the smaller mass difference between Na
andKleads to a ratio of only 39/23 for Ekinof the Na+
and the K+ions compared to an Ekin-ratio between Li+
andK+of 39/7 in the Li-K case. The FWHM of |Ψ(R)|2
is 0.55 ˚A, i.e., the experimental P(R) distributions are
about a factor of two broader. This is similar to the case
of the homonuclear dimers previously studied [21].
IV. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In this work, we have demonstrated a method on how
to separate the different contributions to one fragment ion
species stemming from laser-induced Coulomb explosion
of different parent molecules present in a mixed sample.
Our work concerned a heteronuclear alkali dimer, like LiK,
created on the surface of a helium nanodroplet in which
case the target sample also contained droplets doped with
one of the two homonuclear alkali dimers, i.e., Li2andK2.
We showed that the Li+andK+fragment ions originating
from either Li2,K2, orLiKcan be individually filtered
out using a coincidence method based on the momentum
conservation in the Coulomb explosion process. This
enabled us to determine the kinetic energy distribution of
theLi+andK+ions from Coulomb explosion of LiKand
in turn the distribution of the internuclear distances of the
initial heteronuclear dimer. To demonstrate the versatility
of the coincidence filter technique, we also showed that
it works as desired for NaK in a mixed sample of NaK,
Na2, and K2.
Our method should apply generally to any mixed sam-
ples of homonuclear and heteronuclear dimers of alkali
atoms or of alkali-alkaline earth dimers [ 44,45]. This
also includes the separation of naturally occurring iso-
topologues for a dimer containing only one alkali species
like7Li6Li,6Li2, and7Li2. Furthermore, the technique
could be principally extended to mixed alkali trimers and
higher order oligomers. An immediate use of the coinci-
dent filtering technique is in time-resolved measurement
of rotational and vibrational motion of dimers (or trimers)
since the different masses of the constituents lead to differ-
ent nuclear dynamics. Furthermore, the filter technique
should also apply to identify droplets doped with two
specific dopants inside a droplet [ 2,3,46,47] or with an
alkali atom on the surface and a molecule in the inte-
rior [ 32,48]. Such identification could open possibilities
for exploring ion-molecule complex formation when the
alkali atom is selectively ionized by a femtosecond laser
pulse.DATA AVAILABILITLY

Appendix: NaK: 2D velocity images, radial velocity
distributions and covariance maps
Figure 10 and Figure 11 are similar to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4
but show the experimental results obtained when the
helium droplets pass through the doping cells containing
Na vapor in the first and K vapor in the second pickup
cell. In particular, Fig. 11 displays the radial velocity
map and the angular covariance map of the Na+andK+
fragment ions. The clear correlation corroborates that
the ions originate from Coulomb explosion of NaK, and
thereby validate the filtering used to extract the results
shown in Sec. III B.9
