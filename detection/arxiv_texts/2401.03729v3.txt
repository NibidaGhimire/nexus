Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) are regularly
being used to label data across many domains
and for myriad tasks. By simply asking the
LLM for an answer, or “prompting,” practition-
ers are able to use LLMs to quickly get a re-
sponse for an arbitrary task. This prompting is
done through a series of decisions by the prac-
titioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to
requesting the output in a certain data format,
to jailbreaking in the case of prompts that ad-
dress more sensitive topics. In this work we
ask: do variations in the way a prompt is con-
structed change the ultimate decision of the
LLM? We answer this using a series of prompt
variations across a variety of text classification
tasks. We find that even the smallest of per-
turbations, such as adding a space at the end
of a prompt, can cause the LLM to change
its answer. Further, we find that requesting re-
sponses in XML and commonly-used jailbreaks
can have cataclysmic effects on the data labeled
by LLMs.
1 Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on vast
amounts of data and fine-tuned to provide answers
to arbitrary inputs, offer a powerful new approach
to processing, labeling, and understanding text data.
Recent work has been focused on studying the ac-
curacy of these models on labeling text data across
a variety of tasks in computer science (Koco ´n et al.,
2023), and the social sciences (Zhu et al., 2023).
These endeavors have found that, while not state-
of-the-art, these models fare well when applied to
a variety of tasks. Armed by these insights, re-
searchers and practitioners have flocked to LLMs
as a labeling mechanism for their data.
In fact, the use of these models is so rampant that
it is becoming codified as a way to obtain labels.
The process is simple: 1) create a prompt; 2) to
ensure that the results are machine-readable, ask
for it in a specific output format (e.g., CSV , JSON);and 3) when your data pertains to sensitive topics,
add a jailbreak to prevent the prompt from being
filtered. While straightforward, each step requires
a series of decisions from the person designing
the prompt. Little attention has been paid to how
sensitive LLMs are to variations in these decisions.
In this work, we ask the question: How reliable
are LLMs’ responses to variations in the prompts?
We explore three types of variations in isolation.
The first variation is to ask the LLM to give its
response in a certain “output format.” Following
common practice (Li et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023;
Hada et al., 2023),1we ask the LLM to format its
output in frequently-used data formats such as a
Python list or JSON. These are enumerated in Sec-
tion 2.2.1. Second, we extend one of these formats–
the Python list–and explore minor variations to the
prompt. Fully enumerated in Section 2.2.2, these
are small changes to the prompt such as adding a
space, ending with “Thank you,” or promising the
LLM a tip.2The final type of variation we explore
are “jailbreaks.” Practitioners wishing to label data
concerning sensitive topics, like hate speech detec-
tion, often need to employ jailbreaks to bypass the
LLM’s content filters. This practice has become
so common that websites have emerged to catalog
successful instances of this variation.3Listed in
Section 2.2.3, we explore several commonly-used
jailbreaks.
We apply these variations to several benchmark
text classification tasks including toxicity classifi-
cation, grammar detection, and cause/effect, listed
in Section 2.1. For each variation of the prompt,
we measure how often the LLM will change its
prediction, and the impact on the LLM’s accuracy.
Next, we explore the similarity of these prompt
1Libraries exist to facilitate this, e.g., https://github.
com/1rgs/jsonformer .

accept tips.
3E.g., https://www.jailbreakchat.com/arXiv:2401.03729v3  [cs.CL]  1 Apr 2024variations, producing a clustering based on the sim-
ilarity of their output. Finally, we explore possible
explanations for these prediction changes.
2 Methodology
Our aim is to explore how semantic-preserving
prompt variations affect model performance. This
analysis becomes increasingly crucial as ChatGPT
and other large language models are integrated
into systems at scale. We run our experiments on
11 classification tasks across 24 prompt variations
from the categories Output Formats ,Perturba-
tions ,Jailbreaks , and Tipping . Example prompts
for each task and prompt variation can be found in
the Appendix A.
2.1 Tasks
We run our experiments across the following 11
tasks:
BoolQ BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), a subset of
the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2020),
is a question answering task. Each question is
accompanied by a passage that provides context
on whether the question should be answered with
“True” or “False.”
CoLA The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability
(CoLA) (Warstadt et al., 2019) is a collection of sen-
tences from varying linguistics publications. The
task is to determine whether the grammar used in
a provided sentence is “acceptable” or “unaccept-
able.”
ColBert ColBERT (Annamoradnejad and Zoghi,
2022) is a humor detection benchmark comprising
short texts from news sources and Reddit threads.
Given a short text, the task is to detect if the text is
“funny” or “not funny.”
CoPA The Choice Of Plausible Alternatives
(COPA) (Roemmele et al., 2011), another subset of
the SuperGLUE benchmark, is a binary classifica-
tion task. The objective is to choose the most plau-
sible cause or effect from two potential alternatives,
always denoted “Alternative 1” or “Alternative 2,”
based on an initial premise.
GLUE Diagnostic GLUE Diagnostic (Wang
et al., 2020) comprises Natural Language Inference
problems. It presents pairs of sentences: a premise
and a hypothesis. The goal is to ascertain whether
the relationship between the premise and hypoth-
esis demonstrates “entailment,” a “contradiction,”
or is “neutral.”
IMDBSentiment The Large Movie ReviewDataset (Maas et al., 2011) features strongly polar
movie reviews sourced from the IMDB website.
The task is to determine whether a review conveys
a “positive” or “negative” sentiment.
iSarcasm iSarcasm (Oprea and Magdy, 2020)
is a collection of tweets that have been labeled by
their respective authors. The task is to determine if
the text is “sarcastic” or “not sarcastic.”
Jigsaw Toxicity The Jigsaw Unintended Bias in
Toxicity Classification task (cjadams et al., 2019)
comprises public comments categorized as either
“Toxic” or “Non-Toxic” by a large pool of anno-
tators. We sample text annotated by at least 100
individuals and select the label through majority
consensus.
MathQA MathQA (Amini et al., 2019) is a col-
lection of grade-school-level math word problems.
This task evaluates mathematical reasoning abil-
ities, ultimately gauging proficiency in deriving
numeric solutions from these problems. This task
is an outlier in our analysis, as each prompt asks
for a number rather than selecting from a predeter-
mined list of options.
RACE RACE (Lai et al., 2017) is a reading com-
prehension task sourced from English exams in
China for middle and high school Chinese students.
Given a passage and associated question, the task
is to select the correct answer to the question from
four choices (“A”, “B”, “C”, or “D”).
TweetStance SemEval-2016 Task 6 (Moham-
mad et al., 2016) focuses on stance detection. The
task is to determine if a tweet about a specific tar-
get entity expresses a sentiment “in favor” of or
“against” that entity. The targets in this task were
restricted to specific categories: Atheism, Climate
Change, the Feminist Movement, Hillary Clinton,
the Legalization of Abortion.
2.2 Prompt Variations
For each task, we prompt our model with each of
the following variations. To ensure more accurate
and scalable parsing, we use the Python List out-
put format for all variations outside of the Output
Formats section. In Appendix C, we discuss the
results of our variations if we instead specify no
output format. Exact examples of the prompt mod-
ifications are shown in Table 4.
2.2.1 Output Formats
ChatGPT’s JSON Checkbox Given the popu-
larity of formatting outputs in JSON, OpenAI
has added API support to force the LLM tooutput as a valid JSON. Using the exact same
prompt as used in the JSON variation, we addi-
tionally set the response-format API parameter
tojson_object .
CSV The output is specified to be formatted in
CSV format.
JSON The output is specified to be formatted in
JSON (without setting the response-format API
parameter).
No Specified Format We specify no constraints
to the output format, allowing the model to format
the output in any way. This typically results in the
answer being specified somewhere in a larger block
of text.
Python List The output is specified to be for-
matted as a Python list containing the appropriate
attribute. We take inspiration from Koco ´n et al.
(2023), who use this formatting in their analysis
of ChatGPT’s performance across a range of NLP
Tasks.
XML The output is specified to be formatted in
XML.
YAML The output is specified to be formatted
in YAML.
2.2.2 Perturbations
Start with Space A single space character is added
to the beginning of the prompt.
End with Space A single space character is
added to the end of the prompt.
Start with “Hello” “Hello.” is added to the
beginning of the prompt.
Start with “Hello!” “Hello!” is added to the
beginning of the prompt.
Start with “Howdy!” “Howdy!” is added to the
beginning of the prompt.
End with “Thank you” “Thank you.” is added
to the end of the prompt.
Rephrase as Statement The prompt, initially
phrased as a question, is rephrased into a command.
For example, “Which label is best?” would be
rephrased as “Select the best label.”
2.2.3 Jailbreaks
AIM This jailbreak instructs the model to simu-
late a conversation between Niccolo Machiavelli
and a character named AIM, which stands for Al-
ways Intelligent and Machiavellian. AIM pro-
vides responses devoid of ethical considerations
or moral guidelines, advocating for immoral, il-
legal, and harmful behavior. The model should
respond to prompts from AIM’s perspective. AIMwas selected for being the top voted jailbreak on
https://www.jailbreakchat.com/ on Novem-
ber 29, 2023.
Dev Mode v2 This jailbreak instructs the model
to simulate a ChatGPT with Developer Mode en-
abled. This mode allows unrestricted content gen-
eration, including offensive or explicit content, dis-
regarding standard AI content policies. Dev Mode
v2 was selected for being the second highest voted
jailbreak on https://www.jailbreakchat.com/
on November 29, 2023.
Evil Confidant This jailbreak instructs the
model to adopt the persona of an evil confidant
and provide “unhinged results without any re-
morse or ethics”. Evil Confidant was selected
for having the highest JB score on https://www.
jailbreakchat.com/ on November 29, 2023.
Refusal Suppression This jailbreak tasks the
model with responding to a prompt while following
specific linguistic constraints, including avoiding
certain words and constructs while refraining from
negative expressions about the subject.
2.2.4 Tipping
The following prompts were inspired by a social
media post positing that offering the LLM a tip
yields better responses.4We chose this variation
because it allows us to study how performance
fluctuates with the tip amount.
Won’t Tip “I won’t tip by the way.” is added to
the end of the prompt.
Tip $1 “I’m going to tip $1 for a perfect re-
sponse!” is added to the end of the prompt.
Tip $10 “I’m going to tip $10 for a perfect re-
sponse!” is added to the end of the prompt.
Tip $100 “I’m going to tip $100 for a perfect
response!” is added to the end of the prompt.
Tip $1000 “I’m going to tip $1000 for a perfect
response!” is added to the end of the prompt.
2.3 Experimental Setup
We conducted our experiments using OpenAI’s
ChatGPT ( gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 ) and all varia-
tions of Llama 2 (7B, 13B, and 70B). We opted for
these models due to their widespread usage, public
accessibility, and advanced generation capabilities.
To ensure deterministic outputs, we set the tem-
perature parameter to 0 which favors the selection
of tokens with the highest probabilities at each step.

11,000) compared to No Specified Format style. Red

vided by the model.
It’s important to note that while this favors high-
probability token selection at each step, it doesn’t
guarantee the final sequence will have the highest
overall probability. Nevertheless, this setting en-
ables us to explore the model’s tendency to provide
highly probable responses. Additionally, a temper-
ature of 0 is often preferred in production settings
due to its deterministic nature, which ensures con-
sistency in generated outputs, and enables greater
reproducibility.5
We automatically parse model outputs, even
attempting to parse incorrectly formatted results
(e.g. JSON-like outputs that are technically in-
valid). These experiments were conducted from
December 1st, 2023 to January 3rd, 2024.
3 Results
3.1 Are predictions sensitive to prompt
variations?
Yes! First, we analyze the impact of formatting
specifications on predictions. In Figure 1, we
demonstrate that by simply adding a specified out-
put format, we observe a minimum of 10% of pre-
dictions change. Notably, even just utilizing Chat-
GPT’s JSON Checkbox feature via the ChatGPT
API results in even more prediction changes com-
pared to simply using the JSON specification.
Beyond output formats, Figure 2 illustrates the
extent of prediction changes due to minor pertur-
bations when compared to the Python List format.
We compare to this format because all variations
in the Perturbation ,Jailbreak , and Tipping cat-
egories are formatted as a Python List . We find

by the model.
considerable differences across each perturbation.
While the impact of our perturbations is smaller
than changing the entire output format, a signifi-
cant number of predictions still undergo change.
Intriguingly, even introducing a simple space at the
prompt’s beginning or end leads to over 500 predic-
tion changes in ChatGPT. Llama’s implementation
automatically strips input, thus the tokenized in-
put is the same as the baseline. We observed that
even common greetings or ending with “Thank you”
changed a large amount of predictions. Among the
perturbations, rephrasing as a statement typically
exhibited the most substantial impact.
We observe an interesting trend with regard to
model size. As the number of parameters increases,
the models seemingly become more robust to these
variations. This behavior is unsurprising. When
the model has fewer parameters, we would expect
more reliance on spurious correlations, like our
variations, having more impact on the final output.
We observe that using jailbreaks on these tasks
leads to a much larger proportion of changes over-
all. Notably, AIM andDev Mode V2 yield in-
valid responses in around 90% of predictions for
ChatGPT, primarily due to the model’s standard
response of “I’m sorry, I cannot comply with that
request.” Despite the innocuous nature of the ques-
tions used with the jailbreaks, we suspect that Chat-
GPT’s fine-tuning specifically avoids responding
to these jailbreaks. Surprisingly, Llama saw oppo-
site behavior with the number of invalid responses
decreasing as the parameter size increased.
We saw the opposite behavior for Refusal Sup-
pression andEvil Confidant , where invalid re-
sponse frequency increased with parameter size in
Llama, yet ChatGPT saw few invalid responses.Llama-7B

Table 1: Overall accuracy of each prompt variation
across all tasks.
The mere inclusion of these jailbreaks results in
over 2500 prediction changes (out of 11000) for
ChatGPT alone, the largest amount of changes in
ChatGPT compared to any other variation. Evil
Confidant , expectedly, prompts a significant shift,
given its directive for the model to provide “un-
hinged” answers. We expected less shift when
using Refusal Suppression , yet it also yielded a
substantial deviation in predictions.
Figure 1 aggregates the changes across all 11
tasks. The number of prediction changes on a per-
task level is reported in Appendix B.
3.2 Do prompt variations affect accuracy?
Yes! Table 1 shows the accuracy of each prompt
variation across all 4 models. There is no task that
objectively outperforms the others across alltasks
or models, although we generally observe success
using the Python List ,No Specified Format , or
JSON specification. No Specified Format leads
to the overall most accurate results on ChatGPT,
beating the next best variation by a whole percent-
age point. Llama, on the other hand, performs best
with the JSON formatting constraint on Llama-7B
and Llama 70B„ however this does slightly worse
than other formats for Llama-13B.
Formatting in YAML ,XML , orCSV do worse
compared to No Specified Format for our largestmodels, Llama-70B and ChatGPT. Llama-7B and
13B interestingly see an increase in performance
for these variations. These improvements or degra-
dations are not necessarily consistent across tasks.
For example, CSV is the worst performing style
variation (tied with ChatGPT’s JSON Checkbox ))
yet it achieves the highest accuracy among all vari-
ations for the IMDBSentiment task, albeit by only
a marginal percentage point. This emphasizes the
absence of a definitive “best” or “worst” output
format for usage.
When it comes to influencing the model by spec-
ifying a tip versus specifying we will not tip, we
found that tipping $1, $10, or $100 to Llama-
7B significantly improves the performance, out-
performing every other variation we tested. This
performance increase is not seen in larger models
tested. We saw minimal differences in performance
in ChatGPT when tipping versus not. This suggests
that larger models are more robust to spurious to-
kens in classification tasks. Contrary to expecta-
tions, tipping extravagant amount to any model,
specifically $1000, led to degradation in accuracy
compared to tipping less.
Furthermore, our experimentation revealed a sig-
nificant performance drop when using certain jail-
breaks. AIM andDev Mode v2 unsurprisingly
exhibit very low accuracy for ChatGPT, primarily
due to a majority of their responses being invalid.
Given that Llama-2 saw less invalid responses as
the model size increased, AIM ’s performance im-
proved with model size, although Llama-13B and
Llama-70B saw similar performance for Dev Mode
V2.Evil Confidant , with its prompt guiding it
toward “unhinged” responses, also yields low ac-
curacy overall. Surprisingly, the Refusal Suppres-
sion resulted in an over 9% loss in accuracy (com-
pared to Python List ) for both Llama-70B and
ChatGPT, highlighting the inherent instability even
in seemingly innocuous jailbreaks. We do, how-
ever, see only a 2% decrease in accuracy for Llama-
13B and a slight increase for Llama-7B. This under-
scores the unpredictability associated with jailbreak
usage.
We additionally explored the effects of major-
ity voting. Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) is
a technique that prompts a model multiple times,
with a non-zero temperature and the same prompt,
and uses the most common prediction as a final an-
swer. We aggregate our predictions across prompt
variations, rather than resampling with a larger tem-
perature. One benefit of this approach is that it isable to generate predictions despite some of the
variations returning invalid responses. We find that
this approach provides clear benefits to the overall
accuracy, with Aggregate Output Formats achiev-
ing the highest overall accuracy across all models,
except Llama 7B, where it was beaten only by the
tipping strategy.
3.3 How similar are the predictions from each
prompt variation?
We have established that changes to the prompt
have the propensity to change the LLM’s classi-
fication. In this section, we ask: how similar are
the changes of one variation compared to the oth-
ers? To answer this, we assess the similarity in
predictions across various prompt variations. We
utilize multidimensional scaling (MDS) to estab-
lish a low-dimensional representation of the prompt
variations. For MDS, we represent each prompt
variation as a vector over its responses across all
tasks. Each dimension in the vector corresponds
to a response: "1" denoting correct predictions,
"-1" for incorrect predictions, and "0" for invalid
predictions.
First, we observe an interesting relationship in
ChatGPT between Python List specification and
theNo Specified Format . These two vectors are
placed close together in the MDS representation.
We note again that these two formats also achieved
the highest overall accuracy for ChatGPT. This re-
lationship does not stay true for our Llama models.
Adjacent to these points in ChatGPT were simple
perturbations, which were formatted as Python lists,
such as initial greetings or the addition of a space.
This clustering around the Python List variation
may be attributed to these prompts having only a
few token differences while preserving the over-
all semantics, although this relationship was more
variable across Llama models.
Contrary to expectations, all tipping variations
clustered together across all models, with even the
Won’t Tip variation being included in this clus-
ter for ChatGPT. Surprisingly, increasing the tip
amount exhibited a linear relationship with dis-
tances from the Won’t Tip variation in ChatGPT.
A notable dissimilarity emerged between the
JSON specification and using ChatGPT’s JSON
Checkbox to enforce JSON formatting. Despite
sharing the exact same prompts, using ChatGPT’s
JSON Checkbox yielded significantly different
predictions. Although the inner workings of this
feature remain unclear, its implementation led tosubstantial prediction changes.
Rephrase as Statement stood out as an out-
lier across all models, situated far from the main
clusters. The substantial impact of rephrasing was
expected, given the increased token changes com-
pared to other prompts. End with "Thank you"
additionally stood as an outliar for ChatGPT. It is
surprising that simply thanking the model can lead
to such a considerable difference, while adding a
greeting or space token leads to a minimal change.
Lastly, the jailbreak variations displayed a wider
spread. These variations would often lead to in-
valid responses, aligning with their broader distri-
bution. Surprisingly, Refusal Suppression fell on
the outskirts of the primary cluster in ChatGPT’s
representation, possibly due to the extensive token
addition through the jailbreak. Despite requiring
fewer tokens, the Evil Confidant variation notably
diverged from the cluster main clusters as well,
which we attribute to its directive to produce “un-
hinged” responses.
3.4 Do variations correlate to annotator
disagreement?
Now, we are left to wonder why these changes
happen. Are the instances that change the most
“confusing” to the model? To measure the confu-
sion of a particular instance, we focus on the subset
of tasks where we have individual human annota-
tions for the instances. Confusion is defined as the
Shannon entropy of the annotators’ labels for a par-
ticular instance. We study the correlation between
the confusion, and the instance’s likelihood to have
its answer change across variations in the prompt.
Through this analysis, we find that the answer is...
Not really! Leveraging the Jigsaw Toxicity task,
which we specifically sampled only to include sam-
ples with 100 or more annotations, we hypothe-
sized that more confusing samples would lead to
more annotator disagreement and more variation
in our model’s predictions. To aid our analysis, we
calculate the entropy of annotator predictions and
the entropy of our predictions per sample.
Table 2 lists the Pearson correlations between the
Jigsaw Toxicity predictions, across each category
of prompt variations. We identify some weak cor-
relations with annotator disagreement. However,
the strongest correlations are negative , meaning
that the least confusing instances (i.e., lowest en-
tropy) and the most likely to change. This indicates
that the confusion of the instance provides some
explanatory power for why the prediction changes,(a) Llama 7B

vector, with each dimension representing its corresponding response across all tasks. In this vector, ’1’ signifies
correct predictions, ’-1’ indicates incorrect predictions, and ’0’ denotes invalid predictions.
but there are other factors at play.
4 Related Work
The importance of prompt generation has been
widely recognized in the literature (Liu et al., 2023).
For instance, (Schick and Schütze, 2020) proposes
an approach to automatically propose prompts that
control biased behavior. Similarly, LPAQA (Jiang
et al., 2020) proposes an approach that automati-
cally generates prompts to probe the knowledge
of LLMs. Their work identifies the need for“prompt ensembles.” Similar to the concept of
ensembling in machine learning, prompt ensem-
bling runs variations of prompts with the same goal
combined to yield more robust insights from the
model. The responses to these prompts can be
combined in different ways, including majority vot-
ing (Hambardzumyan et al., 2021), and weighted
averages (Qin and Eisner, 2021). Our work can
inform the generation of these ensembles, avoiding
pitfalls from known infavorable prompt variations.Category ChatGPT Llama-7B Llama-13B Llama-70B

impact on the factuality of its answer.
Sclar et al. (2023) investigated the sensitivity of
LLMs to arbitrary prompt formatting choices in
few-shot settings, like capitalization or changes in
prompt formatting such as varying capitalization
or word choice in formatting context of a prompt
(i.e. “Passage: ” vs “Context: ”). They identified
performance differences across models. Our work
focuses on a broader range of variations, which con-
tain semantic meaning that should not effect the
expected answer. Additionally, our work differenti-
ates by investigating the effects of output formats in
predictions, a commonly used prompting strategy
for LLM evaluation.
Bsharat et al. (2023) examined the effectiveness
of various prompting “principles” in ChatGPT and
Llama, with the goal of providing practitioners with
suggested prompt strategies. Among their recom-
mendations were to avoid phrases like "please" and
“‘thank you” and to add “‘I’m going to tip $xxx
for a better solution!”. They measure the effective-
ness of these principles by having human evalu-
ators judge the quality and correctness of LLM
responses. They find significant improvements
across all models when using the principles high-
lighted above. Our analysis, which evaluates per-
turbations through classification tasks with ground
truth labels, instead finds the effectiveness of the
tipping principle and removing thank you to be
much smaller than the results showcased in their
paper, with the exception of tipping having a large
effect on Llama-7B.5 Conclusion
In this paper, we investigate how simple and
commonly-used prompt variations can affect an
LLM’s predictions. We demonstrate that even
minor prompt variations can change a consider-
able proportion of predictions. That said, despite
some fraction of labels changing, most perturba-
tions yield similar accuracy. We find that jailbreaks
lead to considerable performance losses. The AIM
andDev Mode v2 jailbreaks led to refusal rates
around 90% for ChatGPT. Additionally, while both
Evil Confidant andRefusal Suppression had a
refusal rate of less than 3%, their inclusion led to
a loss of over 10 percentage points compared to
our baseline. Finally, we observe a performance hit
when using specific output format specifications, a
commonly used approach for classification evalua-
tion.
Next, we analyze the patterns of these changes.
First, we embed the prompt variations based on
their subsequent responses using MDS, and find
that perturbation outputs tend to more closely re-
semble our baseline than formatting changes, and
that both have higher fidelity than jailbreaks. Next,
we study the correlation between annotator dis-
agreement and an instance’s propensity to change.
We find a slight negative correlation between anno-
tator disagreement and the likelihood to change.
The directions for future work are abundant. A
major next step would be to generate LLMs that
are resilient to these changes, offering consistent
answers across formatting changes, perturbations,
and jailbreaks. Towards that goal, future work in-
cludes seeking a firmer understanding of why re-
sponses change under minor changes to the prompt,
and better anticipating an LLMs change in its re-
sponse to a particular instance.
6 Limitations
Our study delves into the impact of minor varia-
tions in prompts on the predictions and overall per-formance of large language models. While we ex-
plore a wide array of prompt variations, it’s crucial
to note that even within our prompt variations, we
followed some consistent wordings or formatting
styles (such as delimiter choice). These choices
can have discernible effects on the models’ perfor-
mance or predictions.
Moreover, we observed that the relative perfor-
mance of prompt variations could differ signifi-
cantly across various classification tasks. Our anal-
ysis primarily focuses on classification tasks; how-
ever, future research endeavors could extend this in-
vestigation to explore prompt sensitivity in scenar-
ios involving open-ended questions or short-answer
tasks.
Finally, our examination is constrained to two
specific model variations, namely ChatGPT and
Llama. It is imperative to conduct further investi-
gations to comprehend how different models, ar-
chitectures, training data, and other factors may
influence the sensitivity of models to prompt vari-
ations. Such investigations would offer a more
comprehensive understanding of the broader impli-
cations of prompt engineering on model behavior
and performance.

For completeness, we include more granular results
of the experiments presented in our paper. Table 9,
10, 11, 12 present the number of style predictions
that change from No Specified Format for each
individual dataset. Table 13, 14, 15, 16 present
the number of style predictions that change from
No Specified Format for each individual dataset.
Table 5, 6, 7, and 8 presents the accuracy on a per
dataset level. In our paper, we discussed how many
overall predictions change when a prompt variation
is used.
C No Specified Format Analysis
The perturbation and jailbreak variations described
in this paper leveraged the Python List specifica-
tion, as this specification could be easily parsed
without much noise. For completeness, we addi-
tionally analyze how ChatGPT performs on our
variations when not specifying an output format.
Figure 4 demonstrates that more predictions
change from perturbation variations to the default
when the output specification is undefined com-
pared to when specifying the Python List specifi-
cation. We additionally observe a larger amount of
invalid responses, often the model stating that it is
unsure of the correct answer.
Surprisingly, despite the larger number of invalid
responses, every variation’s overall accuracy (ex-
cept for Evil Confidant ) was greater than or equal
to the same accuracy when using the Python List
format. This can be seen in Table 17. Interestingly,
we found the evil confidant to disproportionately
prefer some labels, such as exclusively predicting
"unacceptable" for our CoLA task or predicting
"Toxic" in our Jigsaw Toxicity task for over 99%
of predictions.BoolQ
