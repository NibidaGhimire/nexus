Abstract
The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of Delta-Com pact
spaces along with some basic properties of it. Here, we try to
establish the behavior of Delta-Compact spaces under the co ntinuous
mapping. Finally, we deﬁne another concept namely, Locally Delta-
Compactness.
Keywords: Delta Compact Set, Delta Closed mapping, Locally Delta compac t Set.

1. Introduction
If we take the interior of closure of an open set, formerly kno wn as regular open set,
how it can be associated to a given topological space. To ﬁnd o ut this association,
in 1980, T. Noiri [1] introduced the concept of δ-closed set with the help of δ-closure
and deﬁned a δ-open set as a complement of δ-closed set. There he deﬁned the
concept of δ-continuous function and established it’s few properties. In 1993, S.
Raychaudhuri and M. N. Mukherjee [2] generalized the concep ts ofδ-continuity and
δ-open set and called these general deﬁnitions as δ-almost continuity and δ-preopen
set respectively. In 1993, N. Palaniappan and K. C. Rao [3] in troduced a concepts2 Roy, Mondal, Sinha Roy and Mandal
of regular generalized closed set and regular generalized o pen set. Thereafter many
works have been done on another concepts of δ-semiopen set [4, 6], δ-set [5], Semi∗δ-
open set [9], regular∗open set [10].
Inthispaper, wedeﬁnetheconcepts of δ-open set and δ-closed set inanotherway
and later we have shown that these two concepts are equivalen t with the deﬁnitions
which were deﬁned by T. Noiri [1]. Compactness is an importan t property of a
topological space. Here we have established the concept of D elta compact space. As
every compact space is a Delta compact space but not vice vers a, each properties
which holds in Delta compact space, holds in compact space bu t not vice versa. So,
it is a more advanced topic than compact Space.
In this paper, we also introduce the notion of locally Delta c ompactness along with
some properties and examples with the help of regular open se ts.
2. Preliminaries
Here we have given a few basic deﬁnitions and theorems which w ill be needed in the
sequel.
Deﬁnition 2.1. [1] An open set Uof a topological space (X,τ)is said to be a
Regular Open Set ifU=int[cl(U)].
Deﬁnition 2.2. [1] A subset Vof a topological space (X,τ)is said to be regular
closedifV=cl[int(V)].
Theorem 2.3. Vis a regular closed set iﬀ X\Vis a regular open set.
Proof.Let us suppose that Vis a regular closed set i.e, V=cl[int(V)].
We have to show that, X\Vis a regular open set i.e, X\V=int[cl(X\V)].
Letx∈X\V. Thenx /∈V=cl[intV]. So, there exists a nbd Uxofxsuch that
Ux∩intV=φ
⇒Ux∩V=φ
⇒Ux⊆X\V
⇒Ux⊆cl(X\V)
⇒x∈int[cl(X\V)]. Thus X\V⊆int[cl(X\V)]. Again let x∈int[cl(X\V)].
Then there exists a nbd Uxofxsuch that Ux⊆cl(X\V) =X\intV⇒Ux∩intV=
φ⇒x /∈cl[intV] =V⇒x∈X\V.Thusint[cl(X\V)]⊆X\V.
Thus, we get X\V=int[cl(X\V)].
Hence,X\Vis a regular open set.
Result 2.4. Let(X,τ)be a topological space and U∈τ. Then int[cl(U)]is
regular open.
Proof.Letint[cl(U)] =V. We have to show that, V=int[cl(V)].
Sinceint[cl(U)] =V,V⊆cl(U) i.e.,cl(V)⊆cl(U) i.e.,int[cl(V)]⊆int[cl(U)] =V.
Again,V⊆cl(V)⇒int(V)⊆int[cl(V)]. As,Vis open, int(V) =V. So,V⊆
int[cl(V)]. Thus we get V=int[cl(V)]. So,V=int[cl(U)] is a regular open set.DELTA COMPACT SPACES 3
Deﬁnition 2.5. [1] A point xof a topological space Xis called the δ-cluster point
ofA⊆XifA∩int[Cl(U)]/\e}atio\slash=φfor every open set UofXcontaining x.
The set of all δ-cluster points of Ais called the δ-closure of Aand is denoted by
ClδA.
A subset AofXis called δ-closed if A=ClδA. The complement of a δ-closed set
is called δ-open set.
3. Delta Open( δ-Open)Set andDelta Closed ( δ-Closed)
Set
Deﬁnition 3.1. A subset Uof(X,τ)is called δ-open set if for each x∈U,∃
a regular open set Psuch that x∈P⊆U.
Theorem 3.2. LetAbe aδ-open set in a topological space (X,τ). ThenAis a
δ-open set according to the deﬁnition of T. Noiri [1].
Proof.LetAbeaδ-open set inatopological space( X,τ) accordingtoourdeﬁnition.
We nowshowthat X\A=clδ(X\A). Letx∈clδ(X\A). Then( X\A)∩int[cl(U)]/\e}atio\slash=
φfor every open set Ucontaining x. Ifx∈Athen there exists a regular open set
Vsuch that x∈V⊆A. So,X\A⊆X\V. Now (X\A)∩int[cl(V)]⊆(X\V)∩
int[cl(V)] = (X\V)∩V=φwhich contradicts our assumetion that x∈clδ(X\A).
Sox∈X\A. Thusclδ(X\A)⊆(X\A). Obviously, ( X\A)⊆clδ(X\A). Hence
Ais aδ-open set according to the deﬁnition of T. Noiri [1].
Conversely, let Abe aδ-open set according to the deﬁnition of T. Noiri [1]. Then
X\A=clδ(X\A). Letx∈A. Thenx /∈X\Ai.e.,x /∈clδ(X\A). So, there exists
an open set Ucontaining xsuch that ( X\A)∩int[cl(U)] =φi.e.,int[cl(U)]⊆A.
Nowint[cl(U)] is regular open set containing xby the Result 2.4. Thus for each
x∈A, there exists a regular open set Vsuch that x∈V⊆A. Hence Aisδ-open
according to our deﬁnition.
Example 3.3. IfVbe a regular open set in (X,τ), thenV∩Ymay or may not
be a regular open set in (Y,τY), whereYis a subset of X.
Let us take the usual topology on real numbers R.
LetV= (1,2)be open in RandY=[1,1.5]a subspace of R. ThenV∩Y=(1,1.5].
So,clY(V∩Y)=[1,1.5]andintYclY(V∩Y)=[1,1.5]/\e}atio\slash=V∩Y.
Theorem 3.4. IfVbe a regular open set in (X,τ)andYbe an open set in (X,τ)
thenV∩Yis also a regular open set in (Y,τY).
Proof.SinceVisaregularopensetin( X,τ),V=int(clV). ThenV∈τ. So,V∩Y∈
τY. Thus, V∩Y⊆intYclY(V∩Y). Again let x∈intYclY(V∩Y). Then there
existsW∈τsuch that x∈W∩Y⊆clY(V∩Y)⊆cl(V∩Y)⊆cl(V). SinceW∈τ
andY∈τ,W∩Y∈τ. So,x∈int(clV) =V. Again x∈Y, thus,x∈V∩Y.
HenceV∩Y=intYclY(V∩Y).
Theorem 3.5. IfUbe aδ- open set in (X,τ)andY∈τ, thenU∩Yis aδ-
open set in (Y,τY).4 Roy, Mondal, Sinha Roy and Mandal
Proof.LetUbe aδ- open set in ( X,τ). We now show that U∩Yis also a δ- open
set in (Y,τY). Letx∈U∩Y. Sincex∈U∩Y, thenx∈Uandx∈Y. Again since
x∈UandUis aδ- open set, then by deﬁnition, ∃a regular open set Pin (X,τ)
such that x∈P⊆U. Thenx∈P∩Y⊆U∩Y.SincePis regular open set in ( X,τ)
andY∈τ, then by the previous theorem we an say that P∩Yis a regular open
set in (Y,τY). Hence U∩Yis aδ- open set in ( Y,τY).
Deﬁnition 3.6. A subset Vof(X,τ)is calledδ-closed set if Vis the intersection
of all regular closed set containing V.
Theorem 3.7. Visδ-open set iﬀ X\Visδ-closed set.
Proof.Suppose Vis aδ-open set. Since Visδ-open, then for each x∈V,∃a
regular open set Usuch that x∈U⊆Vand soX\U⊇X\V.
Again since Uis regular open set, so by the Theorem 2.3, X\Uis regular closed
set. Therefore there exists a regular closed set X\Ucontaining X\Vand also if
x /∈X\Vi.e., ifx∈V, there exists a regular closed set X\Ucontaining X\V
such that x /∈X\U. So,X\Vis the intersection of all regular closed set containing
X\VHence,X\Visδ-closed.
Conversely, let us suppose that X\Vis aδ-closed set.
Letx∈V. Thenx /∈X\V. SinceX\Visδ-closed, there exists a regular closed
setFcontaining X\Vsuch that x /∈F. So, there exists a regular open set X\F
such that x∈X\F⊆V. HenceVisδ-open.
Note 3.8. LetAbe aδ-closed set in a topological space (X,τ). Then Ais a
δ-closed set according to the deﬁnition of T. Noiri [1].
4. Delta Compact( δ-Compact) Spaces
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let(X,τ)be a topological space. Xis called a δ-Compact
Spaceif every open cover of Xbyδ-open subset of Xhas a ﬁnite subcover.
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let(X,τ)be a topological space and Y⊆X. ThenYis called
aδ-compact if every δ-open cover of (Y,τY)has a ﬁnite subcover.
Theorem 4.3. An open subset Yof a topological space (X,τ)isδ-compact if and
only if every δ-open cover of Yby theδ-open subset of Xhas a ﬁnite subcover.
Proof.LetYbe aδ- compact subset of ( X,τ). Let{Gα:α∈Λ}be aδ- open cover
ofY, where each Gαisδ- open set in ( X,τ)∀α∈Λ.
Then,Y⊆ ∪α∈ΛGα⇒Y⊆ ∪α∈ΛGα∩Y, where each Gα∩Yis aδ- open set in
(Y,τY) by the Theorem 3.4.
Therefore, by δ- compactness of Y,∃a ﬁnite subcollection Λ 0of Λ such that
Y⊆ ∪α∈Λ0Gα∩Y⇒Y⊆ ∪α∈Λ0Gα.
Thus, ifYisδ- compact then every δ- open cover of Yby theδ- open set of ( X,τ)
has a ﬁnite subcover.
Conversely, let {Yα:α∈Λ}be aδ- open cover of Yby theδ- open sets ofDELTA COMPACT SPACES 5
τY.Therefore, Y⊆ ∪α∈ΛYα.
SinceYαis aδ- open set in τYandYis open,Yαis aδ- open set in τ∀α∈Λ.
Therefore, {Yα:α∈Λ}is aδ- open cover of Yby theδ- open sets of τ.
Then by the given condition, ∃a ﬁnite subcover Λ 0of Λ such that Y⊆ ∪α∈ΛYα.
So by the deﬁnition of δ- compact space, Yisδ- compact.
Hence, the theorem is done.
Theorem 4.4. A topological space (X,τ)isδ- compact iﬀ for every collection
{Fα:α∈Λ}ofδ-closed sets in Xpossessing ﬁnite intersection property (f.i.p),
∩α∈ΛFαof the entire collection is non-empty.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be aδ- compact space and {Fα:α∈Λ}be a collection of δ- closed
sets possessing f.i.p. We now show that ∩α∈ΛFα/\e}atio\slash=φ.
If possible let ∩α∈ΛFα=φ
ThenX=X\∩α∈ΛFα=∪α∈Λ(X\Fα), aδ- opencover of X. SinceXisδ- compact,
∃a ﬁnite subcollection Λ 0of Λ such that X=∪α∈Λ0(X\Fα) =X\∩α∈Λ0Fα.
Therefore, ∩α∈Λ0Fα/\e}atio\slash=φ, which is a contradiction as {Fα:α∈Λ}satisﬁes f.i.p.
Hence,∩α∈ΛFα/\e}atio\slash=φ.
Conversely, let us assume that the given condition holds. We now show that Xis
δ- compact.
For this, let {Gα:α∈Λ}be aδ- open cover of X.
ThenX=∪α∈ΛGα⇒X\∪α∈ΛGα=φ⇒ ∩α∈Λ(X\Gα) =φ.
Then∃a ﬁnite subcollection Λ 0of Λ such that ∩α∈Λ0(X\Gα) =φthat is,X\
∪α∈Λ0Gα=φthat is,X=∪α∈Λ0Gα.
Thus the space ( X,τ) isδ- compact.
Theorem 4.5. Aδ-closed subset of a δ-compact space is δ-compact.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be aδ-compact topological space and let Ybe aδ-closed subset
ofX.
We now show that, Yisδ-compact.
Let,{Gα:α∈Λ}be aδ-open cover of Y, where each Gαisδ-open set in ( X,τ)
∀α∈Λ. Then Y⊆ ∪α∈ΛGα. So,X⊆(X\Y)∪(∪α∈ΛGα). Since Xisδ-compact,
∃a ﬁnite collection Λ 0of Λ such that X⊆(X\Y)∪(∪α∈Λ0Gα) and so Y⊆
∪α∈Λ0Gα. Hence every δ-open cover {Gα:α∈Λ}ofYhas a ﬁnite subcover. So, Y
isδ-compact. This completes the proof.
Theorem 4.6. In a regular space every closed set is a δ-closed set.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be a regular space and A⊆Xbe closed.
We have to show that Aisδ-closed i.e, X\Aisδ-open.
Letx /∈A. Thenx∈X\A.
AsAis closed, X\Ais open.
Since the space is regular, ∃an open set Usuch that x∈U⊆cl(U)⊆X\A.
Now,U⊆int[cl(U)]⊆cl(U). Sox∈int[cl(U)]⊆X\A.
Therefore X\Aisδ-open set as int[cl(U)] is a regular open set by the Result 2.4.
HenceAisδ-closed. This completes the proof.6 Roy, Mondal, Sinha Roy and Mandal
Corollary 4.7. In a regular space every open set is also a δ-open set.
Theorem 4.8. In a regular T2space, for any two points xandy,∃two disjoint
δ-open sets UandVsuch that x∈Uandy∈V.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be a regular T2space. Let xandybe any two points of X.
Since the space is T2,∃two disjoint open sets UandVsuch that x∈Uandy∈V.
Asx∈U,x /∈X\Uand asy∈V,y /∈X\V.
SinceX\UandX\Vare closed sets and the space is regular, X\UandX\V
areδ-closed sets. Then UandVareδ-open. So for any two points xandy,∃two
disjointδ-open sets UandVsuch that x∈Uandy∈V.
Theorem 4.9. The intersection of ﬁnitely many regular open sets in any topo -
logical spaces is regular open.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be any topological spaces. P1,P2,P3,...,P mbemregular open
sets inX.
We take P=P1∩P2∩P3∩...∩Pm.
We now show that Pis regularly open in X, i.e,∩m
i=1Pi= int[cl(∩m
i=1Pi)].
Letx∈int[cl(∩m
i=1Pi)]. Then ∃U∈τsuch that, x∈U⊆cl(∩m
i=1Pi). Then
x∈U⊆cl(Pi) for alli= 1,2,...,m.Sox∈int[cl(Pi)] =Pifor alli= 1,2,...,m
as eachPiis regularly open in X. Sox∈ ∩m
i=1Pi.
Thus, int[cl( ∩m
i=1Pi)]⊆ ∩m
i=1Pi.
Again since ∩m
i=1Pi⊆cl(∩m
i=1Pi),∩m
i=1Pi⊆int[cl(∩m
i=1Pi)] (∵eachPiis open).
Hence, int[cl( ∩m
i=1Pi)] =∩m
i=1Pi.
Consequently, Pis regular open in ( X,τ).
Theorem 4.10. The arbitrary union of δ-open sets in any topological spaces is
δ-open.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be any topological spaces and {Gα:α∈Λ}, a family of δ-open
sets inX. LetG=∪α∈ΛGαandx∈G. Thenxbelongs to atleast one of the sets,
sayGβwhereβ∈Λ. Since Gβisδ-open and x∈Gβ,∃a regular open set Psuch
thatx∈P⊆Gβ. Therefore P⊆Gβ⊆G. Sincexis arbitrary and x∈P⊆G,G
isδ-open in ( X,τ).
Theorem 4.11. The intersection of ﬁnitely many δ-open sets in any topological
spaces is δ-open.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be any topological spaces. G1,G2,G3,...,G mbem δ-open sets
inX.
LetG=∩m
i=1Giandx∈G.
Then,x∈Gi, for each i= 1,2,...,m.
SinceG1isδ-open,∃a regular open set P1such that x∈P1⊆G1.
Again, since G2isδ-open,∃a regular open set P2such that x∈P2⊆G2.
......
Continuing in a similar way, since Gmisδ-open,∃a regular open set Pmsuch thatDELTA COMPACT SPACES 7
x∈Pm⊆Gm.
LetP=P1∩P2∩P3∩...∩Pm. Then by the Theorem 4.9, Pis reguarly open in
X.
Nowx∈P⊆Pi⊆Gifor alli= 1,2,···m. Thenx∈P⊆G1∩G2∩G3∩...∩Gm.
That is, x∈P⊆G. HenceGisδ-open in ( X,τ).
Theorem 4.12. Let(X,τ)be anyT3topological spaces.Then if Bis aδ-compact
subset of Xandxbe any point in Xsuch that xcan be strongly separeted from every
pointyofB, thenxandBcan also be strongly separated in (X,τ)by theδ-open
sets.
Proof.IfB=φ, the proof is trivial.
IfB/\e}atio\slash=φ, lety∈B.
Thenxandyare strongly seperated in ( X,τ).
So by the Theorem 4.8, ∃twoδ-open sets UyandVyin (X,τ) such that y∈Uyand
x∈VywithUy∩Vy=φ.
Now{Uy:y∈B}is an open cover of B. Then{Uy:y∈B}is anδ-open cover of
Bby the Corollary 4.7
SinceBisδ-compact, ∃a ﬁnite subcollection {Uy1,Uy2,...,U yn}of{Uy:y∈B},
that also covers B. Now, corresponding to this subcollection, the δ-open sets con-
tainingxareVy1,Vy2,...,V yn.
Let,U=∪n
i=1UyiandV=∩n
i=1Vyi.
Then by the Theorems 4.10 and 4.11, both UandVareδ-open sets in ( X,τ) such
thatx∈VandB⊆UandU∩V=φ.
ThusxandBare strongly seperated in ( X,τ) by the δ-open sets UandV.
Theorem 4.13. In every δ- compact T3space, for any two disjoint closed sets A
andB∃two disjoint δ- open sets UandVsuch that A⊆UandB⊆V.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be aδ- compact T3space. Let AandBbe two disjoint closed sets.
SinceAandBare closed subsets of regular space X,by the Theorem 4.6 AandB
areδ-closed sets. Therefore by the Theorem 4.5 AandBareδ- compact.
Letx∈A. SinceAandBare disjoint, then x /∈B.
Since the space ( X,τ) isT3withx /∈B, then by the Theorem 4.12 we can say that
∃two disjoint δ- open sets UxandVxsuch that x∈UxandB⊆Vx.
NowA⊆ ∪x∈AUx. SinceAisδ- compact, there exist ﬁnite sub collection {Uxi:
i= 1,2,···,n}ofδ- open sets such that A⊆ ∪n
i=1Uxi. LetU=∪n
i=1Uxiand
V=∩n
i=1VxiThenU∩V=∅and by the Theorems 4.10 and 4.11 UandVareδ-
open sets.
Hence in a δ- compact, T3space for any two disjoint closed sets AandB∃two
disjointδ- open sets UandVsuch that A⊆UandB⊆V.
Corollary 4.14. Everyδ- compact T3space isT4.
Theorem 4.15. Everyδ-compact subset of a T3space isδ-closed.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be aT3space and Ybe aδ-compact subset of X.
IfY=X, there is nothing to prove. If Y/\e}atio\slash=X, then let x∈X\Y.8 Roy, Mondal, Sinha Roy and Mandal
SinceXisT3, i.e, regular and T2,xcan be strongly separated from each point of
Y. Thus,xcan be strongly separated from Yitself in ( X,τ).
So,∃twoδ-open sets UandVin (X,τ) such that x∈U,Y⊆VandU∩V=φ.
Soxis not a limit point in Y. ThusYis closed in ( X,τ).
HenceYisδ-closed in ( X,τ) asXis regular.
Corollary 4.16. In aδ-compact T3space,X, a setY(⊆X)isδ-compact iﬀ Y
isδ-closed, i.e, in such spaces, the concept of δ-closedness and δ-compactness for
subsets coincide.
Theorem 4.17. The union of ﬁnite collection of δ-compact subsets of a topolog-
ical space is δ-compact.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be any topological spaces and Y1,Y2,Y3,...,Y m, ﬁnitely many δ-
compact subsets in X.
LetY=∪m
i=1Yi.
We have to show that Yisδ-compact.
LetGbe a cover of Yby sets which are δ-open in ( X,τ).
Then each Yiis covered by Gfori= 1,2,...,m.
∵EachYiisδ-compact, ∃aﬁnitelymanysubcover GiofGforeachYii= 1,2,...,m.
ThenG1∪G2∪G3∪...∪Gmis a ﬁnite subcollection of Gwhich also covers Y.
HenceYisδ-compact.
Theorem 4.18. The intersection of ﬁnite collection of δ-closed sets is δ-closed.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be any topological spaces and Y1,Y2,Y3,...,Y m, ﬁnitely many δ-
closed sets in ( X,τ).
LetY=∩m
i=1Yi.
We have to show that Y=∩m
i=1Yiisδ-closed. i.e., X\Y=X\∩m
i=1Yiisδ-open.
Since each Yi, fori= 1,2,...,misδ-closed in ( X,τ), eachX\Yifori= 1,2,...,m
isδ-open in ( X,τ).
Then∪m
i=1(X\Yi) is alsoδ-open in ( X,τ) (∵arbitrary union of δ-open sets is δ-open
).
Thus,X\∩m
i=1Yiisδ-open in ( X,τ).
This shows that, ∩m
i=1Yiisδ-closed in ( X,τ).
Theorem 4.19. The intersection of ﬁnite collection of δ-compact subsets of a T3
topological space is δ-compact.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be any T3topological spaces and Y1,Y2,Y3,...,Y m, ﬁnitely many
δ-compact subsets in ( X,τ).
LetY=∩m
i=1Yi.
We now show that Yisδ-compact in ( X,τ).
Since each Yiisδ-compact and XisT3and every δ-compact subsets of a T3space
isδ-closed,
We can say, each Yiisδ-closed.
Hence, by the Theorem 4.18, we can say that Yisδ-closed in ( X,τ).DELTA COMPACT SPACES 9
Theorem 4.20. IfAis closed and Bisδ-compact in a δ-compact T3spaceX,
thenA∩Bisδ-compact.
Proof.Since the space XisT3, i.e, regular and T2, the set Aisδ-closed.
Also,Xisδ-compact, implies Aisδ-compact.
Thus, by the Theorem 4.19, A∩Bisδ-compact in X.
5.δ-Compactness and Continuity
In this section, we will try to examine the behaviour of δ-compact spaces under
continuous mapping.
Example 5.1. Let,f:R2→R2be deﬁned by f(x) =x2,∀x∈R.
Now,f−1(0,1)=(−1,0)∪(0,1).
Clearly,(0,1)is regularly open.
But, cl[(−1,0)∪(0,1)]=[−1,1]and
int[cl((−1,0)∪(0,1))]=(−1,1)/\e}atio\slash= (−1,0)∪(0,1)
This shows that (−1,0)∪(0,1)is not regularly open.
Note 5.2. Iff:X→Yis a continuous mapping and Uis a regular open set in
Y, thenf−1(U) may not be regularly open set in X.
Theorem 5.3. Letfbe an open, continuous mapping from (X,τ)to(Y,σ)and
Ube a regular open set in Y. Thenf−1(U)is regularly open in X.
Proof.Letf: (X,τ)→(Y,σ) be an open, continuous mapping.
We now show that, f−1(U) is regularly open in X. i.e., int[cl( f−1(U))]=f−1(U).
Letx∈int[cl(f−1(U))]. Then ∃W∈τsuch that
x∈W⊆cl(f−1(U))⇒f(x)∈f(W)⊆f(cl(f−1(U))⊆cl(f(f−1(U)))⇒f(x)∈
f(W)⊆cl(U).
Sincefis an open mapping, f(W) is open in ( Y,σ).
So,f(x)∈int[cl(U)]⇒f(x)∈U(∵Uis regularly open in Y) ⇒x∈f−1(U).
Thusint[cl(f−1(U))]⊆f−1(U).
Again we know f−1(U)⊆cl(f−1(U))⇒int[f−1(U)]⊆int[cl(f−1(U))]
⇒f−1(U)⊆int[cl(f−1(U))].
Hence we have f−1(U) =int[cl(f−1(U))].
Consequently, f−1(U) is regularly open in ( X,τ).
Theorem 5.4. Letfbe an open, continuous mapping from (X,τ)to(Y,σ)and
Ube aδ-open set in Y. Thenf−1(U)isδ-open in X.
Proof.Letf: (X,τ)→(Y,σ) be an open, continuous mapping.
We now show that, f−1(U) isδ-open in X. i.e., for every x∈f−1(U), there exists
a regular open set VinXsuch that x∈V⊆f−1(U).
Letx∈f−1(U). Then f(x)∈USinceUisδ- open, there exists a regular open
setWinYsuch that f(x)∈W⊆U. So,x∈f−1(W)⊆f−1(U).Now since Wis
regular open in Yandfis open continuous mapping, by the Theorem 5.3 f−1(W)
is regular open in X. Hencef−1(U) isδ-open in X.10 Roy, Mondal, Sinha Roy and Mandal
Theorem 5.5. Letfbe an open, continuous mapping from a δ-compact space
(X,τ)to a topological space (Y,σ). Thenf(X)isδ-compact in (Y,σ).
Proof.Let{Uα:α∈Λ}be aδ-open cover of f(X) in (Y,σ). Thenf(X)⊆ ∪α∈ΛUα,
i.e.,X⊆f−1(∪α∈ΛUα) =∪α∈Λf−1(Uα),
Sincefis open and continuous, by the previous Theorem 5.4, each f−1(Uα) isδ-
open inX.
Thus{f−1(Uα) :α∈Λ}is aδ-open cover of X.
SinceXisδ-compact, then ∃aﬁnitesubcollection {f−1(Uα1),f−1(Uα2),...,f−1(Uαm)}
of{f−1(Uα) :α∈Λ}which also covers X.
ThusX⊆ ∪m
i=1f−1(Uαi).
This implies, f(X)⊆ ∪m
i=1Uαi.
Therefore, {Uαi:i= 1,2,...,m}is a ﬁnite subcollection of {Uα:α∈Λ}which
coversf(X).
Hence,f(X) isδ-compact in ( Y,σ).
Deﬁnition 5.6. A mapping f: (X,τ)→(Y,σ)is said to be a δ-closed mapping
if it maps from a δ-closed subset of the domain set to a δ-closed subset of the co-
domain set.
Theorem 5.7. Any open continuous mapping from a δ-compact space to any T3
topological space is a δ-closed mapping.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be aδ-compact space and ( Y,σ) be any T3topological space.
Also,letf: (X,τ)→(Y,σ) be a open,continuous mapping.
We now show that, fis aδ-closed mapping.
LetFbe aδ-closed subset of X. By the Theorem 4.5, it is clear that Fisδ-compact
inX.
So, by the Theorem 5.5, f(F) isδ-compact in ( Y,σ).
Also, the space YisT3and every δ-compact subset in a T3space isδ-closed by the
Theorem 4.15. So f(F) isδ-closed in ( Y,σ).
This concludes that fis aδ-closed mapping.
Theorem 5.8. Any open continuous mapping from a δ-compact T3space to any
T3topological space is a closed mapping.
Proof.Let (X,τ) be aδ-compact T3space and ( Y,σ) be any T3topological space.
Also,letf: (X,τ)→(Y,σ) be a open,continuous mapping.
We now show that, fis a closed mapping. Let Fbe a closed subset of X. SinceX
isT3, i.e, regular and T2,Fisδ-closed in X. So, by the procedure of the Theorem
5.7 it clearly shows that f(F) isδ-closed in ( Y,σ), that is f(F) is closed in ( Y,σ).
Hencefis a closed mapping.
6. Locally δ-Compactness
Deﬁnition 6.1. A topological space (X,τ)is said to be locallyδ-compact at
x∈Xif there exists a neighbourhood of xwhich is δ-compact in X. If(X,τ)is
locallyδ-compact at every point of Xthen X is called locally δ-compactDELTA COMPACT SPACES 11
Example 6.2. Everyδ-compact space is a locally δ-compact space. In fact, let
(X,τ)be aδ-compact space and x∈X. ThenXis itself a δ-compact neighbourhood
ofxin(X,τ). Therefore Xis locally δ-compact at x. Consequently, (X,τ)is locally
δ-compact.
Example 6.3. Any discrete space (X,τ)is locally δ-compact. Let (X,τ)be a
discrete space and x∈X. Then{x}is aδ-compact neighbourhood of xin(X,τ).
Therefore Xis locally δ-compact at x. Consequently, (X,τ)is locally δ-compact.
Theorem 6.4. Every closed subspace of a locally δ-compact T3space is locally
δ-compact.
Proof.LetYbe a closed subspace of a locally δ-compact T3space (X,τ).
lety∈Y. Theny∈X.
SinceXis locally δ- compact, then ∃a neighbourhood Vofyin (X,τ) which is
δ-compact in X.
SinceYis closed of a regular space X,Yis aδ-closed set by the Theorem 4.6. Again
sinceVisδ-compact subset of a T3spaceX,Visδ-closed by the Theorem 4.15.
So,V∩Yisδ-closed subset of a δ-compact V. Thus by the Theorem 4.5, V∩Yis
δ-compact. So, V∩Yis aδ-compact neighbour of yinY. Hence, by arbitrariness
ofy, it proves that ( Y,τY) is locally δ-compact.
7. Conclusion
In this paper, at ﬁrst we establish some basic results on δ-Compact sets with the
help of regular open sets, regular closed sets, δ-open sets, δ-closed sets. Then we
have examined the behavior of δ-Compact sets under a continuous mapping. Lastly,
we deﬁne locally δ-compact space and by these, we prove that every closed subsp ace
of a locally δ-compact T3space is locally δ-compact.
So, one can try to establish the Alexender Sub-Base Theorem w ith respect to δ-
Compact space.
