The coupling of microwave and optical systems presents an immense challenge due to the natural
incompatibility of energies, but potential applications range from optical interconnects for quantum
computers to next-generation quantum microwave sensors, detectors or coherent imagers. Several
engineered platforms have emerged that are constrained by specific conditions, such as cryogenic
environments, impulse protocols, or narrowband fields. Here we employ Rydberg atoms that allow
for the natural wideband coupling of optical and microwave photons even at room temperature and
with the use of a modest setup. We present continuous-wave conversion of a 13.9 GHzfield to a
near-infrared optical signal using an ensemble of Rydberg atoms via a free-space six-wave mixing
process, designed to minimize noise interference from any nearby frequencies. The Rydberg photonic
converter exhibits an unprecedented conversion dynamic range of 57 dBand a wide conversion
bandwidth of 16 MHz. Using photon counting, we demonstrate the readout of photons of free-space
300 Kthermal background radiation at 1.59 nVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2(3.98 nVcm−1Hz−1/2) with the
sensitivity down to 3.8 Kof noise-equivalent temperature, allowing us to observe Hanbury Brown
and Twiss interference of microwave photons.
Coherent conversion between energetically separated
domains of microwave (MW) and optical radiation
demonstrates a demanding issue at the frontier of pho-
tonics and quantum science. With the recent progress in
the field of quantum computing [1], the most disruptive
invention would be a realization of optically connected
qubits, giving rise to the perspective of hybrid quantum
networks [2] and the quantum internet [3]. Nevertheless,
several other rapidly developing fields would greatly ben-
efit from MW-photonic conversion with near-term and
still noisy performance, including fundamental [4–6] and
observational radio-astronomy [7–9], THz imaging [10]
and next-generation MW sensing [11].
To this day various approaches to the MW conversion
task have been presented, utilizing piezo-optomechanics
[12–17], electro-optomechanics [18–21], magneto-optics
[22–24], electro-optics [25–30], vacancy centers [31] and
Rydberg excitons [32]. Notably, several works presented
realize MW conversion in Rydberg alkali atoms [33–
36]. This flexible medium provides a multitude of possi-
ble conversion modes with resonant transition frequency
scaling as 1/n3for consecutive principal quantum num-
bersn, and transition dipole moment scaling as n2, thus
allowing for excellent sensitivity and in turn efficiency
of conversion. Owing to their MW transitions, Rydberg
atoms also carry a history of extremely impactful exper-
iments in MW cavity QED (quantum electrodynamics)
with atomic beams [37–39]. Up to date all of the works
realizing MW-to-optical conversion require carefully en-
gineered systems, either in the form of developed trans-
ducer structure, cryogenic environment or laser-cooled
∗m.parniak@cent.uw.edu.platoms. Optical interconnection of remote qubits will cer-
tainly necessitate a system of uncompromising perfor-
mance, but many applications could benefit from near-
term and noisy converters. In this case, it is of particu-
lar benefit to employ a simple system, preferably operat-
ing at room temperature. Recent works show that many
of the quantum devices can be based on hot atomic va-
pors, includingquantummemories[40,41], single-photon
sources [42, 43] and photonic isolators [44]. With astro-
nomical MW measurements in mind, it is also worth re-
memberingthatatomicvaporsalreadyplayaninvaluable
role in satellite navigation as a part of atomic clocks [45].
Hereweemployahot-atomsystemforthetaskofMW-
to-optical upconversion. We demonstrate as a proof-
of-concept that the Doppler-broadened rubidium energy
level structure is well-suited to produce atomic coher-
ence resulting in a microwave-to-optical converted field.
Furthermore, we take advantage of the straightforward
nature of the hot-atom approach to present a continuous-
wave (CW) realization of free-space MW field conversion,
in opposition to the previous approaches [33–35] in cold
atomic media, which had to work in impulse regime due
to magneto-optical trap (MOT) operational sequence.
Despite the simplicity, we achieve an unprecedented MW
conversion dynamic range, descending down to thermal
limit, where we are able to measure the autocorrelation
function of free-space MW thermal photons to support
this claim. The conversion bandwidth is on par with the
best results in employing other wideband conversion me-
dia [14, 17, 24, 27, 29]. We present the means to tune the
conversion band beyond this, and we discuss the meth-
ods to extend the dynamic range, surpassing the thermal
limit.
Our idea is based on extending the robust two-photon

of telecom O-band) laser field, transferring atomic pop-
ulation from Rydberg state and enabling the emission at
the52D5/2→52P3/2(776 nm) transition. This scheme
allows for robust conversion – free from both noise in-
terference and from strong classical fields spectrally close
to signal field. Remarkably, the realization is all-optical
and no ancillary MW field is necessary, further simpli-
fying the setup, as well as broadening its potential ap-
plications. We also avoid using ultraviolet (UV) fields
(employed in the recent remarkable work of Kumar et
al.[36]), which are particularly problematic both in the
generation of narrowband CW laser beams and in their
destructive impact on optical elements and thus the lifes-
pan of the device.RESULTS
Conversion in warm Rydberg vapors Room-
temperature atoms in vapor cells are easy to har-
ness experimentally, yet they provide limited options
for full quantum control due to Doppler broadening
and collisions, which may particularly influence Ry-
dberg atoms. We therefore start by showing that
the room-temperature atomic vapors are adequate to
facilitate the Rydberg-assisted conversion process. In
our demonstration, a cylindrical vapor cell serves as a
hot-atom Rydberg converter (Fig. 1 a). Three focused
optical fields determine an interaction region, where
ground-state atoms are supplied from the remainder
of the cell via thermal atomic motion, assuring that
neither depletion nor other long-term time-dependence
occur, thus satisfying CW operational framework. These
fields combined with a MW field realize coherent (for
the measurements of coherence see Supplement S.4)
six-wave mixing (Fig. 1 c) with emission at 776 nm.
We utilize sign-matched σtransitions with the largest
dipole moments (maximal FandmFquantum numbers)
driven by circularly-polarized fields. The conversion3

along with the shape of the curve. The error bars presented on aandbare calculated from photon-counting standard deviation,√¯n(with thermal radiation treated as added noise), where in each case the ¯nis explicitly noted as photon rates on the Y axis,

scheme constitutes a closed cycle without the need for
repumping. The conservation of energy and momentum,
governing the wave mixing process, assure that temporal
and spatial properties of converted photons are pre-
served. In contrast to previously presented conversion
schemes [33–35], this scheme does not require additional
MW field, and all the introduced optical fields are
spectrally different well enough to be separated with the
use of free-space optics, even in a collinear configuration.
Consideringfielddetuningsfromtheenergylevelstruc-
ture, we observe that similarly as in [35] the best conver-
sion efficiency is achieved for off-resonant realization, as
shown in the Fig. 1 din relation to the EIT effect. Here
the detuning applies to Doppler-broadened level struc-
ture, involvingarangeofatomicvelocityclasses. Wepar-
ticularly find that the detuning from level 552D5/2plays
an important role in increasing the efficiency of conver-
sion, yielding a nearly fivefold improvement in efficiency
at∆55D=20·2πMHzin comparison to the resonant case.Continuous-wave conversion Atomic conversion pro-
cesses arise from atomic coherences, which in the quan-
tum mechanical approach can be derived from state
density matrices ˆρ. With the incident weak MW field
EMWand strong drive fields we obtain an optical co-
herence ρsand thus expect emission of the signal field
asEs∼ρs= Tr( |52D5/2⟩⟨52P3/2|ˆρ)∼EMW. The

try systems. We employ the steady-state solution of the
GKSL equation as the basis for the parametric numerical4

simulation utilized as an aid to interpret the experimen-
tal results we present. We consider a range of atomic ve-
locity classes contributing to the conversion process and
take into consideration the shape of the interaction vol-
ume. We find that the conversion is facilitated by the
steady-state coherence ρs. Remarkably, the steady-state
coherence arises partially due to decoherence and influx
of ground-state atoms into the interaction region.
Our approach can be compared with the pulsed ap-
proach to conversion which requires tailoring of the
Hamiltonian ˆH(t)(e.g. by sequentially turning on the
driving fields and enabling the conversion for short time
only) to maximize the coherence and in consequence the
conversion output. This approach, showcased particu-
larly in [35], can be implemented in Doppler-free cold-
atomsystemandleadstohigh,localconversionefficiency,
albeit it is practically limited to operating for as short as
1/1000of10 mstime sequence. The potential applica-tions are thus narrowed down to the instances where the
converter can be triggered to a short signal or where we
aim to convert a strong classical field. Our antipodal CW
approach addresses this gap, enabling uniform, trigger-
free conversion of weak or asynchronous signals.
Dynamic range and efficiency With the use of a
single-photon counter, we measure the converter’s re-
sponse to MW field intensity. As shown in the
Fig. 2 a, the converted signal ranges from 2.1·103to
1.5·109phot/s. We identify the upper bound as satu-
ration from energy levels shift due to A-T splitting, and
the lower limit as free-space thermal MW photons cou-
pling to the converter. We adjust for other sources of
noise, directional and polarization coupling to the con-
verter, and the measured conversion band. The elec-
tric field spectral density level of observed thermal ra-
diation, 1.59 nVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2(isotropic, both polar-
izations), agrees very well with the theoretical prediction5
of1.64 nVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2(see Methods for derivation).
We note, however, that such a remarkable agreement oc-
curs for the employed model that is simpler than the re-
ality of the experiment, i.e. the presence of MW antenna
near the converter is not accounted for. Nevertheless, we
are able to confirm the matching of two fundamental ref-
erences for MW field intensity, namely the thermal bath
and the Autler-Townes splitting.
We consider the efficiency of the implemented conver-
sion: Fig. 2 bshows relative conversion efficiency >0.5
and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) >1(in relation to ther-
mal noise) for 57 dBof MW intensities (from 4.0·10−10to
1.9·10−4W/m2), which we identify as the converter’s dy-
namic range. The data is presented with normalization
to the highest measured value. The converter’s response
to MW field and conversion efficiency are well-predicted
by the numerical simulation, where only the overall effi-
ciency is parametrically matched.
As far as the absolute efficiency is concerned, several
teamsadoptedanapproachwherethereferenceMWpho-
ton rate is taken from the intensity multiplied by the area
of the interaction medium [33–35]. Care must be taken
when interpreting this area-normalized efficiency, since
the interaction region is significantly sub-wavelength for
the MW fields. By adopting the same approach, we ob-
tain a 3.1±0.4%atomic efficiency (see Supplement S.1
for estimation). We are also able to use our full model to
give a theoretical prediction (assuming no signal deple-
tion) for the area-normalized efficiency as 2.8±1.6%(see
Supplement S.1 for calculation), which matches the ob-
served value. We expect that for our case as well as the
previous free-space experiments this efficiency would be
achieved if the MW mode was confined to the interaction
volume, e.g. by means of a waveguide. In port-coupled or
cavity-based conversion cases [36] the absolute efficiency
can be estimated unambiguously.
Conversion band With the use of single photon
counter we measure the conversion’s dependence on MW
frequencyinthelinearresponseregime(Fig.3 a), arriving
at a bandwidth Γcon= 16·2πMHzFWHM (full width
at half maximum). Further explorations reveal interde-
pendence on MW and decoupling ( 1258 nm ) fields de-
tunings, that can be utilized as a means to fine-tune the
converter to incoming MW field. We show that with such
a procedure we are able to widen the tunable conversion
bandwidth up to 59·2πMHzFWHM.
Photonic conversion of thermal radiation We
perform single-photon autocorrelation measurement
(Fig. 3 b) on the thermal radiation signal, confirming
the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect of thermal
photon bunching ( g(2)(0)>1) for MW photons. The
results obtained experimentally agree perfectly with the
parameter-free theory drawn from the Wiener-Khinchin
theorem,

the assumption that thermal radiation locally has white

in the Fig. 3 b, we consider both thermal radiation and
non-thermal noise present in the system (see Methods for

1.868±0.035and coherence time τ0= 26.0±1.5 ns.
Next we introduce a resonant coherent MW field of
strength comparable to the thermal field – in terms of
converted photons rates ¯ncohfor coherent photons and
¯nthfor thermal photons. We estimate the g(2)(0)value
for consecutive measurements (Fig. 3 c), in agreement
with the theory. Interestingly, the introduction of a
strongerbut ∆ωfar-detunedcoherentfield, whilekeeping
¯ncoh≈¯nth, leads to a beat modulation of the autocorrela-
tion function (Fig. 3 d). Specifically in this case

where g(1)

Noise figure Withnoexternalfieldappliedtothecon-
verter, we observe photons, which by disabling each field
and cross-correlation analysis we identify as consisting of
85%thermal radiation, 13%fluorescence of optical ele-
ments induced by 480 nmlaser field and 2%other noise.
This proportion results in an overall 5.7:1signal-to-noise
ratio, and as the signal is thermal in this case, we can
translate it straightforwardly to a noise-equivalent tem-
perature TNE= 53 K. As the added noise is wideband,
we utilize additional cavity-assisted filtering of thermal
signal, improving the ratio to 77:1, thus TNE= 3.8 K.
We present these values in the Fig. 2 aas a reference to
the converter’s response characteristics. See Supplement
S.2 for cross-correlation analysis and comparison of dif-
ferent sources of noise.
Observation of bright resonances Following the short
demonstration of the level-detuned working regime in the
Fig. 1 d, we further explore the conversion’s dependence
on the detunings from bare atomic levels – realized with
proportional detunings of the fields. We find this do-
main the most convenient to operate in, as it naturally
obeys the conservation of energy in six-wave mixing. In
general, with a hot-atom system, the Doppler effect pre-
vents interpretations as simple as in the cold-atom case.
However, in our case, we find that the Doppler effect is
mostly canceled via the selection of velocity class in the
two-photon process, i.e. with probe and coupling fields.
We expect that the conversion loop is actually composed
of two dressed-state subsystems: the three-level system
dressed by coupling and probe fields, and the two-level
system dressed by the decoupling field. Indeed, by scan-
ning the ∆55Dlevel detuning, we observe resonances cor-6

we observe broadening rather than clear splitting into

, which is
due to particular interference of different velocity classes.
Via numerical studies we found that this splitting is ob-
served only at much higher decoupling Rabi frequencies
in different scans. We also note that the blue-detuned
resonance results in a slightly stronger conversion than
the red-detuned, which we attribute to the interfering
effect of other energy levels (that may take part in wave-
mixing process) on the latter. Our observation confirms
that bright resonances |B±⟩are essential in the conver-
sion process. The conversion process is optimized by ac-
cessing one of the resonances through detuning from the
two-photon resonance (and thus also avoiding the dark
resonance |D⟩), as seen in the Fig. 1 cand as observed in
other free-space experiments [35].
DISCUSSION
Thepresentedproof-of-conceptwarm-atomicconverter
exhibits flexibility in terms of high dynamic range and
wide bandwidth, which supports its potential for appli-
cations. We believe the fields of contemporary astron-
omy could benefit from conversion-based MW photonicmeasurements [4–9], where Rydberg atoms excel in sim-
plicity, adaptability and presented low noise figures. As
the conversion scheme utilized here is all-optical, it can
be applied in similar systems (i.e. cold trapped atoms
and superheterodyne Rydberg electrometry) to avoid the
introduction of noise by spectrally close fields. We high-
light many desirable properties of the presented con-
verter. The very ability to perform photon counting of
microwave radiation at room temperature along with ob-
servation of the HBT interference and coherent-thermal
interference is remarkable, as those feats typically re-
quire deeply cryogenic conditions [51]. The converter
presents an extremely large dynamic range and excel-
lent bandwidth, along with many options for both fine
and very coarse tuning to different Rydberg levels. The
all-optical realization gives further prospects for applica-
tions as even strong electromagnetic interference would
not damage the device. This could be important for
microwave-based communication, where another advan-
tage may come from avoiding shot noise of homodyne
detection via photon counting.
There are numerous issues that so far escaped the
scope of this work and could be explored in more de-
tail to the benefit of increasing the conversion’s range
and efficiency. Because thermal photons are spread over
the whole conversion band, the limit approached in the
Fig.2 aisnotfundamental, asefficientnarrowspectralfil-
teringorphase-lockingmeasurementwouldpushitdown,
enabling detection at the single-photon level. The non-
thermal noise may be decreased further e.g. by utilizing
different optical elements in the setup (specifically ad-
dressing the 480 nmfluorescence) or by exploring non-
collinear configuration of the laser fields. Various op-
timization efforts may also be performed to find work-
ing points with greater conversion efficiency, though the
operational regime of warm atomic vapors and strong
probe field does not allow for simple theoretical predic-
tions. The converter’s response to MW pulses is yet to
be investigated, as well as pulse-control of laser fields
or coherent repumping of atomic population, though the
complexity of the setup would then inevitably increase.
Additionally, the operation mode of the Rydberg con-
verter in principle can be thoroughly shifted to adapt to
emission at the telecom C-band wavelength – specifically,
42D5/2→52P3/2transition occurs at 1530 nm.
The all-optical realization could be retained while de-
signing a setup that exploits the Doppler effect cancella-
tion in a wider scope (i.e. by using different transitions),
enabling more atoms to take part in the conversion pro-
cess. Conversely, a range of atomic velocities may be
seen as the means to further widen the tunable conver-
sion band. We believe that with commensurate detun-
ingsofall-opticalfield, thetunableconversionbandwidth
can be extended to as much as 600 MHz (the width of
Doppler-broadened probe absorption line), thus with the
considerationoftheneighboringRydbergtransitions, the
converter could efficiently cover the full range of MW
frequencies up to 50 GHz, only with the tuning of laser7
fields. To our knowledge, such an ultrawide adaptable
conversion band is possible only with warm Rydberg
atomic vapors. Finally, we also expect that the reverse
process of optical-to-microwave conversion should be fa-
cilitated by our setup via coupling of atoms to microwave
resonators (see Supplement S.6 for details).
Thus we envisage that further progress will be cen-
tered around introducing warm Rydberg atomic vapors
to MW cavity systems, as it will enhance the coupling
between MW field and atomic interaction volume. Our
all-optical scheme is well-suited for that task; in com-
parison, the six-wave mixing schemes involving two MW
transitions would require a doubly-resonant cavity with
close-bybutnon-degenerateresonances. Thedesignprin-
ciples for hot-atom MW-cavity systems can be drawn
from cavity-enhanced atomic clocks. Even with mod-
erate finesse, we expect the conversion efficiency to be
significantly enhanced, likely even leading to radiative
cooling of the cavity mode via conversion. At the same
time, a lot of potential lies in recent progresses in mi-
crofabrication of atomic devices [52], such as micro- and
nanoscale vapor cells [53, 54] and hollow-core photonic
bandgap fibers filled with alkali atoms [55]. These instru-
ments may enable all-fiber, reproducible applications of
the presented converter’s model, paving the way to next-
generation MW converting sensors.
METHODS
Density matrix calculation As indicated in the main
text, we solve the five-level GKSL equation in the steady
state, i.e. ∂tˆρ= 0. The Lindbladian is constructed
from the Hamiltonian and the jump operators using
the QuantumOptics.jl package [56]. We next solve for
the steady-state using standard linear algebra meth-
ods finding the zero eigenvalue. We employ jump op-
erators ˆJnfor spontaneous decay and for transit-time
decay, i.e. atoms exiting the interaction region with
ground-state atoms entering instead. Each solution is
for a given set of Rabi frequencies, detuning and a spe-
cific velocity class v(along the longitudinal direction).
The detunings are modified due to the Doppler effect
as∆v
n=∆n±knvwith n∈{p, c,MW, d}. We next per-
form averaging of the resulting state-state density ma-
trix ˆρover the Doppler velocity profile with weight-
ing function f(v)=p
m/2πkBTexp 
−mv2/kBT
(with
mbeing the85Rb atomic mass) and over the Gaus-
sian profile of the beams due to changing Rabi frequen-
cies. Unless noted otherwise, the MW Rabi frequency is
taken well below the saturation point. Finally, we ex-
tract the generated signal, always plotted as intensity,
as|Es|2∼|Tr(52D5/2
52P3/2ˆρ)|2or the EIT signal as
Im(Tr(52S1/2
52P3/2ˆρ)).
Phase matching Efficient conversion requires all
atoms interacting with the MW field to emit in phase.
This renders the phase-matching condition that deter-
mines the conversion efficiency depending on the MWfield mode. Thus we introduce the phase-matching fac-
torηphm(θ)for a plane-wave MW field EMW(θ)enter-
ing the medium at angle θto the propagation axis ( z).
The factor is then calculated by projecting the generated
electric susceptibility onto the detection mode usbeing
a Gaussian beam focused in the center of the cell ( z0=0)
with w0=100 µm. To obtain the projection we assume
the spatial dependence of the susceptibility in the form
of the product of all interacting fields. This is a sim-
plification compared with the full model, as in general
the steady-state density matrix and, in turn, the coher-
enceρshave a more complex dependence on strong drive
field amplitudes. Nevertheless, for the purpose of spatial
calculation, the simplified approach yields proper results
and then the susceptibility takes on a form:
χθ=EpE∗
pEcE∗
dEMW(θ), (4)
with the optical fields ( Ep,Ec,Ed) taken to be Gaussian
beams with the same z0andw0as the detection mode
us. Additionally, we account for the relatively strong
absorption of the probe ( Ep) field by multiplying its am-
plitude by the exponential decay exp(−αz)with (mea-
sured) α=19 m−1. Finally, the coefficient is calculated
as the following integral:

where L=50 mm is the length of the glass cell.
Thermal modes consideration Let us now estimate
the effective field root-mean-square amplitude due to
thermal black-body radiation in our given conversion
band, which takes into account that our converter is both
polarization and wavevector sensitive. In order to do so,
we follow a standard derivation of Planck’s law, however,
when considering all electromagnetic modes we account
for both the polarization-dependence and phase match-
ing during conversion. The effective mean-square field
amplitude at the temperature Tmay be written as fol-
lows:

⟨E⟩=ℏω
eℏω/kBT−1, (7)
where ωis the frequency of the MW field, cis the speed
of light, ε0is vacuum permittivity and kBis the Boltz-
mann constant. Importantly, η(θ)is the field conversion
efficiency coefficient that arises from projecting the MW
field in the plane-wave modes at the given angle θonto
circular polarization along the conversion axis and mul-
tiplying it by the phase matching factor:
|η(θ)|2=

In fact the efficiency |η(θ)|2represents the converter re-
ception pattern, which we plot in the Fig. 5. From the8

beams.
patternweseethatthecontributiontotheeffectivenoise-
equivalent field at temperature Tcomes mostly from the
phase-matched microwaves coming from an almost right-
angled cone with the correct circular polarization. Fi-
nally, we refer the effective field convertible by the atomsp

⟨E2⟩, which
can be calculated by plugging in |η(θ)|2=2(because of
two polarizations).
In the Fig. 2 awe find that the thermal radia-
tion level (without added non-thermal noise) corre-
sponds to 3.41·10−10W/m2or5.07µV/cm, as cal-
ibrated from the A-T splitting at large fields. To
calculate spectral field density, we consider the con-
version bandwidth using an integral measure ˜Γcon=

rive withp

indeed highly consistent with the model prediction ofp
⟨E2

the total field fluctuations, we obtain the results quoted
in the text, i.e.p

sured andp
⟨E2⟩= 1.64 nVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2predicted.
(For detailed analysis of photon rates and electric field
densities see Supplement S.3.)
Thermal and coherent states autocorrelation function
We consider the autocorrelation measurements with
three different sources of photons, defined by rates: ¯nth
for thermal state photons, ¯ncohfor coherent state pho-tons and ¯nnoisefor photons coming from wideband, non-
interfering sources (e.g. various forms of fluorescence).
We follow the derivation presented in [57] (and later
showcased in [13, 36]) to arrive with the following general
form of second order autocorrelation function
g(2)(τ) = 1 +¯nthg(1)
th(τ) + ¯ncohe−iωτ2
−¯n2

(¯nth+ ¯ncoh+ ¯nnoise)2,(9)
where ωis the coherent state frequency. In
the Fig. 3 b,c,d¯nnoise/¯nth=15/85, in the Fig. 3 d
¯ncoh/¯nth=100 /85.
Theg(1)
thcorrelation function is obtained from power
spectral density in the Fig. 3 avia the Wiener-Khinchin
theorem, Eq. (2), and then used to calculate g(2)for
comparison with the experiment. The conversion band-
width is measured via photon-counting detection in the
domain of MW field detuning – we directly change the
MW frequency fed to the antenna. The next crucial step
to equate the measured conversion bandwidth with the
power spectral density of thermal radiation coupling to
the converter |S(ω)|2is to assume that thermal radiation
has a white noise characteristics within our band of in-
terest (i.e. for free uncoupled radiation |S(ω)|2= const).

Laser fields parameters The laser beams are focused
to equal Gaussian waists of w0=100 µmand com-
bined with the use of dichroic mirrors (Fig. 6 f). The
probe beam counterpropagates with respect to the other
fields and its transmission through85Rbmedium is
then utilized as a means for calibration via EIT effects
(Fig. 1 d,e). The length of vapor cell is 50 mm. The
collinearlaserfieldsconfigurationisassuredwith 4fopti-
calsystems(notshownonthescheme)withmirrorsatfo-
cal planes, enabling independent control of every beam’s
position an propagation angle. The employed laser beam
effective peak Rabi frequencies for 780 nm,480 nmand
1258 nm fields are derived from the numerical simulation
asΩp=8·2πMHz,Ωc=22·2πMHzandΩd=17·2πMHz
respectively. The optimal dominant detuning from the
55Dlevel is measured as ∆55D= 16·2πMHz(Fig. 4 a)
andisusedasaworkingpointformeasurements,withthe
other detunings being near-zero. For the Fig. 1 and 6 e
the MW Rabi frequency is set to about ΩMW=8·2πMHz,
while for the Figs. 3 and 4 ait is deeply in the unsatu-
rated regime. For the Fig. 4 athe decoupling intensity is
increased to about Ωd=25·2πMHzpeak. The calibration
of detuning zero-points takes place at the85Rbworking
temperature to account for pressure shifts of Rydberg
energy levels.
Temperature stabilization and microwave shielding
The measured optimal85Rbworking temperature,
T=42◦C, is ensured via hot air heating, as this method
introduces little interference to MW fields propagating
through the vapor cell. The air is heated and pumped
through a specially designed hollow 3D-printed resin cell
holder (Fig. 6 c), where the heat exchange takes place.
The cell is enclosed inside a MW absorbing shield, made9

Figure 6. Details of the entire experimental setup. a , Laser system. A narrowband fiber laser at 1560 nm serves as a
frequency reference for the entire system. The laser is amplified via erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and the frequency
is doubled using a second-harmonic generation (SHG) process to 780 nm. The 960 nmexternal-cavity diode laser (ECDL) is
amplified using a tapered amplifier (TA) and frequency-doubled via cavity-enhanced SHG to yield a coupling field at 480 nm.
The960 nmlaser is stabilized to the master laser of 1560 nm using a common cavity. A similar independent system is introduced
for the stabilization of decoupling ( 1258 nm) laser, likewise for local oscillator (LO) 776 nmlaser. The second harmonic of the
1560 nm fiber laser serves as a reference for offset-locking of the probe laser in an optical phase-locked loop (PLL). b, Microwave
generation system. The generated microwaves are attenuated adequately and split into the spectrum analyzer for power and
frequency references and to the antenna. c, Thermal image of the cell and cell holder. The constant temperature of the
cell is assured with hot-air heating via hollow channels in the 3D-printed cell holder. d, The generated signal light exits the
converter in a beam with a Gaussian profile shown in the image. e, Heterodyne measurement with LO yields spectrum of the
converted signal: the residual broadening of Γsig=86·2πkHzFWHM is due to collective laser-locking phase noise. f, Scheme of
the experimental setup: probe, coupling and decoupling laser beams are combined with dichroic mirrors (DM) into a collinear
configuration, and focused inside a rubidium vapor cell of length 50 mmand diameter 25 mmwith a MW helical antenna
pointed there. The circular polarization of lasers is assured with quarter-wave plates (QWP). The probe ( 780 nm) signal
is registered by an avalanche photodiode (APD), which enables laser calibration by observation of EIT features. Converted
776 nmsignal is spectrally separated and coupled into a single-mode fiber. g, Different setups are used for detection, with
single setup being used at a time. The detection setups include direct photon counting with optional attenuation, cavity-filtered
photon counting, photon autocorrelation with two channels simultaneously, and heterodyne detection. For photon counting,
a multichannel superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) is used. For heterodyne measurement we combine
the signal with LO using a polarization beam splitter (PBS) and split the combined signal 50:50with a half-wave plate (HWP)
and a second PBS. The signal is then registered on a differential photodiode (PD).

EA-LF500), with sub-MW-wavelength apertures for op-
tical beams – the shield also provides additional thermal
isolation, reducingfluctuationsoftemperature. Thetem-
perature of the shield inside, for the reference to black-
body radiation, is measured as 26−27◦C. The MW heli-
cal antenna is placed inside the shield and the collinear
propagationisassuredwithopticalfieldspassingthroughan aperture at the backplate of the antenna (Fig. 6 f).
Frequency stabilization and calibration The lasers in
the experiment are stabilized (Fig. 6 a) to a narrowband,
frequency-doubledfiberlaser(NKTPhotonics, 1560 nm),
which is itself stabilized to a Rb cell via a modulation-
transfer lock. The probe laser at 780 nm is stabilized
to the frequency-doubled reference via an optical phase-
locked loop (PLL). The 1258 nm laser (decoupling), the10
960 nmlaser(frequency-doubledtoyieldcouplinglightat
480 nm, Toptica DL-SHG pro) and the 776 nmlaser act-
ing as LO, are all stabilized to the reference at 1560 nm
using independent cavities via transfer locks. Laser fields
are calibrated in low-intensity regimes with the use of
EIT effects observed in the probe field transmission, reg-
istered on the control avalanche photodiode (Thorlabs
APD120A, Fig. 6 f). MW field, generated via LMX2820
PLL frequency synthesizer, is coupled to the antenna and
spectrum analyzer (Agilent N9010A EXA) used for rel-
ative reference of field amplitude (Fig. 6 b). Absolute
MW field amplitude is calibrated with a standard mea-
surement of A-T splitting [46]. As a method to quantify
the converter’s ability to distinguish photons incoming
from spectrally different sources, we perform a hetero-
dyne measurement, yielding the converter’s signal width
Γsig= 86·2πkHzFWHM (Fig. 6 e). This value may be
interpreted as a measure of collective laser-locking phase
noise.
Measurement techniques Initially, the 776 nm sig-
nal is reflected from a bandpass filter and then passed
through a series of free-space spectral filters (highpass,
lowpass, 1.2 nmspectral width bandpass) and coupled
to a fiber. Due to the Gaussian characteristics of the
beam (Fig. 6 d), coupling losses are negligible in this case
(<25%). We apply various detection methods pictured
in the Fig. 6 g. Additional filtering in the measurement of
noise-equivalent temperature is performed with an opti-
calcavity( 160 MHz spectralwidth, 80finesse). Themea-
surement of photon counting is performed with a single-
photon detector (ID Quantique ID281 superconducting
nanowire single-photon detector) with 85%quantum ef-
ficiency, <1 Hzdark count rate and 35 nsrecovery time.
As the detector’s reliable response to incoming photons is
attheorderof <107phot/s, calibratedneutraldensityfil-
ters are applied to the signal above this value. The auto-
correlation measurement is performed on two channels of
the single-photon detector after splitting the signal 50:50
withafibersplitter. Theheterodynemeasurementisper-
formed using a custom-made differential photodiode with
the use of 776 nmLO laser, 20 mWpower. The image of
the beam profile (Fig. 6 d) is taken on a >50%quantum
efficiency CMOS camera (Basler acA2500-14gm). The
supplementary measurements of temperature (including
Fig. 6 c) are performed with a calibrated thermal camera(Testo 883).

S.1 SUPPLEMENTARY DISCUSSION ON THE EFFICIENCY OF CONVERSION
The estimation of the efficiency of the microwave-to-optical conversion appears to be a complex topic if considered
in free space. Most simulations predict optical photon rates [phot /s]for given MW intensities [W/m2](or equivalently
[phot /s/m2]). These are also the quantities directly available in the experiment, where the intensity can be obtained
from the Autler-Townes splitting calibration, and the photon rates from the single photon counting. To arrive with
the efficiency of the conversion, η[phot /phot], one has to perform a full 3D near-field simulation of the conversion
process.
A simpler approach is to consider an effective aperture [m2], where the conversion occurs. This is completely correct
in the case of a large (larger than the wavelength) conversion medium. However, we operate in the subwavelength
regime, w0= 100 µm≪21.5 mm = λMW, where this approach may lead to errors and a full near-field simulation
would be more appropriate, especially in the case of significant conversion efficiency. In the case of great efficiency,
the field is (by assumption) strongly affected by the ensemble, therefore significant diffraction may occur and thus the
resulting effective area is larger than assumed. Nevertheless, the efficiency obtained from this approach will be the
true photon-to-photon efficiency if the single-mode MW field is confined to the atomic medium volume, for example
using a traveling-wave resonator/waveguide, but also with a cavity. In free space however, one needs to remember that
a radiation mode cannot be confined to such a small volume, and therefore the given efficiency does not correspond
to any free-space mode.
To achieve a proper comparison with the results of other groups, especially Ref. [33-35], we would like to perform a
similar estimation of an effective aperture. However, it is important to note that our implementation differs from the
ones in Ref. [33-35]. In these cases the interaction area is determined by cold atoms trapped in MOT, whose shape
and optical density can be straightforwardly measured e.g. with camera imaging. On the other hand, in our case the
interaction area is defined by three optical laser beams (Gaussian) interacting with atomic gas freely entering and
exiting the area. Additionally, the conversion efficiency is in fact nontrivially position-dependent due to the beams’
profiles, induced light shifts, and saturation effects.
Effective aperture
We undertake a simple approach similar to the Ref. [33-35] to estimate the effective interaction area, while stressing
that as our overall efficiency is relatively small, we can neglect the diffraction effects along the atomic ensemble. In
case of a single Gaussian beam with waist w0, assuming conversion’s linear dependence on the intensity of an optical
field, I, one would arrive with effective area estimate at the focus of the beam

Losses in the experimental setup
The implemented setup is subject to losses in the output of the converter. We put the consideration of all the losses
in the Sup. Tab. I. The measurements were performed with an assisting 776 nmfield propagating along the expected
conversion’s direction. Overall losses account for 58%.
Accounting for losses in the setup leads us to an estimate of atomic peak conversion efficiency of 3.1±0.4%.14

Theoretical estimate
To obtain a theoretical estimate of the efficiency of conversion, we perform numerical simulations in the context
of the theory presented in the manuscript. Thus we interrogate the results of our full atomic simulation, as given
by Eq. (1) in the ∂tˆρ(t) = 0case. Within the linear regime (as in the Fig. 2 a) we check that at peak conversion we
obtain the mapping from incident microwave Rabi frequency onto an output optical atomic coherence ρs, observing
a slope β= dρs/dΩMW= 17 (rad /s)−1≈1.1×10−4(2πMHz)−1(quantyfing amount of atomic coherence per unit
of Rabi frequency). This allows us estimate an intensity-to-intensity efficiency as the ratio of microwave and optical
field intensities normalized by the photon energy ratio. The expression is following, and in the linear regime:

and no input signal depletion (which remains valid for low efficiencies). There are several parameters here that bear
significant uncertainties, which leads to a rough estimate of η= 2.8±1.6%, which agrees with the experimental result.
S.2 PHOTON RATES, NOISE LEVELS AND NOISE-EQUIVALENT TEMPERATURE
Cross-correlation analysis of laser fields
The values of various components of the observed optical signal have been obtained by a cross-correlation analysis
based on measuring the output photon rate for all possible combinations of one or more lasers switched off. In the first
step, the preliminary measurements identified the cross-correlation between all the introduced optical fields. Photons
rates for all of the combinations of laser fields are presented in the Sup. Fig. 1. It was observed that the MW field had
no effect on photon rates, apart from the obvious case with all the other fields on, where we observe the conversion
of coherent state. To extract the information about each field contributing to the overall registered signal (i.e. in the
p+c+d case), we treat the measured values (in the order from the Sup. Fig. 1) as a vector and perform a matrix
operation on it with the inverse of the correlation matrix:

that the contributions of two-field combinations are near-zero and thus we neglect them in further considerations.
Furthermore, we interpret the p+c+d case as the thermal radiation coupling to the converter.
In the second step we modified the optical filtering setup of the converted signal ( 776 nm) in order to eliminate
the effects of other lasers disturbing the photon counting measurements (cases p, c and d). Namely, we replaced
a10 nmbandwidth filter used in the preliminary measurements with the set of filters described in the Methods
(highpass, lowpass, 1.2 nmbandpass). This led to the registered rates in the Sup. Fig. 3 and the analysis has shown
the elimination of photon rate contributions in the cases p and d, as shown in the Sup. Fig. 4. However, photon rate
contribution in the case c could not be fully eliminated – we identify this effect as wideband fluorescence of glass
elements induced by the 480 nmfield. From now on to assess the fluorescence (and other) noise level, we turned off
the1258 nm field only. To assess the other noise level, we turned off the 480 nmfield only.
Inthethirdstep, whenmeasuringthedynamicrangefromtheFig.2 a, wemeasuredphotonratesofoverall, thermal,
fluorescence and other noise levels, as a reference. The results, consistent with the measurements in the main text,
are presented in the Sup. Tab. II.
Noise-equivalent temperatures
The noise level (thermal and non-thermal) was measured in the T= 300Kenvironment. We came to the conclusion
that the ratio between thermal noise (measured if and only if every field was switched on) and non-thermal noise
is85%to15%, as shown in the Sup. Fig. 4 and in the Sup. Tab. II. From that we deduce that the thermal noise
corresponds to the measured temperature of black-body (MW absorbing foam) T= 300K and non-thermal noise
corresponds to noise-equivalent temperature of TNE= 53 K. In this approach we consider the thermal signal as the
proper result (fundamentally guaranteed by the theory of black-body radiation) and the non-thermal noise as a noise
added by our device. However, if we were to measure another signal in relation to the thermal, the noise-equivalent
temperature in the presented environment would be TNE= 353 K, as presented in the Sup. Tab. II, along with other
values.
The lowest limit of 3.8Kwas obtained with an additional filtering incorporating an optical cavity, that on the
one hand allowed for the conversion of thermal radiation from the whole bandwidth (the bandwidth of the cavity17

was160 MHz versus 16 MHz of conversion bandwidth), and on the other hand allowed for successful filtration of
wideband noise – the initial bandwidth that could couple to the signal fiber after passing through filters, at the order
of500 GHz (1.2 nm), was narrowed down to 160 MHz . This allowed for the elimination of noise, which we identified
as 480nm-induced glass fluorescence, and led us to reducing noise-equivalent temperature of our device from 53K
to3.8Kby improving the thermal/non-thermal noise ratio. This is a demonstration of sensitivity of our device to
photon-based MW measurements. One could imagine approaching single-photon operations e.g. on cosmic microwave
background with such a device (still noisy but not impossible, and subject to further optimizations).18
The values obtained for the measurements with additional cavity filtering were 325±8 phot /sfor thermal photons
and4.2±0.5phot /sfor other noise photons, resulting in overall TNE= 3.8±0.5 Knoise-equivalent temperature.
Photon rates and photon pair rates
In the Fig. 3 c(and similarly in the Fig. 3 b) the value of total registered photon rate with antenna turned off is
¯nth+ ¯nnoise= 1550 phot /s, thus from the 85%proportion, the thermal photon rate is ¯nth= 1320 phot /s. The source
of losses in this case (comparing to 1740 phot /sat the Fig. 2) is different measurement scheme compared to that in
the Fig. 2. Namely, we utilise two channels of single-photon detector to measure correlation between them, so we use
50:50 fiber splitter – thus there is fiber – splitter – two fibers connection versus fiber – fiber connection. Actually,
there is a slight asymmetry introduced by the splitter, where we register 660 phot /son one channel of the detector
and890 phot /son the other in case of the antenna turned off. However, these rates are for single photons on each
channel. The rate of correlation-measured excess bunched photon pairs (contributing to the peak e.g. in the Fig. 3 b)
in thermal radiation is around 20 pairs /h.
All of the values of ¯nthand¯ncohwere measured by measuring photon rates on the two channels of the photon
detector. Actually, the measured quality is ¯nth+ ¯ncoh+ ¯nnoisebut individual rates can be extracted from a sepa-
rate measurement with antenna turned off (thus ¯ncoh= 0) and from the knowledge of thermal/non-thermal noise
proportion.
S.3 DERIVATION OF THE FIELD SPECTRAL DENSITY OF THE MEASURED THERMAL
RADIATION
As for the derivation of 480 pVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2from the Fig. 2 a, the registered signal with antenna turned off is
2050 phot /s, as demonstrated in the Sup. Tab. II. From this we deduce that as thermal noise corresponds to 85%
of the signal, it is at the level of 1740 phot /s. This consequently corresponds to a measured field of 5.07µV/cm, as
we describe in the Methods. However, this is thermal field integrated over whole conversion bandwidth, so we divide
by the square root of integrally measured bandwidth ( 17.8·2πMHz, as described in the Methods) and arrive at the
480 pVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2.
To achieve consistency between measured 480 pVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2and theoretically predicted
1.64µVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2, we notice that the theory predicts thermal spectral density propagating in all direc-
tions, in both polarisations. However, in the Phase matching section in the Methods, and in the Extended Data
Fig. 2, we show that our converter is sensitive mainly to one circular polarisation and quite directional – only 18%
of whole spherical distribution is coupled to the device. In consequence only around 9%of all thermal radiation
incident can couple to the converter. Adjusting for that property, we arrive at the value 1.59µVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2,
from experimental data, which is very near the theoretical prediction of 1.64µVcm−1(rad/s)−1/2.
S.4 SUPPLEMENTARY DISCUSSION ON THE COHERENCE OF THE CONVERSION PROCESS
Unaffected coherent conversion on long timescales can be demonstrated with introducing two MW fields of slightly
different frequencies at the input of the converter. The converted signal for both MW fields would in this case
experience the same fluctuations and thus the phase difference between the two signals will be preserved.
To demonstrate the coherence of the conversion process, we apply simultaneously two near-optimal MW fields
(generated from different VCOs synchronized with the same clock) of similar strengths, detuned by 3·2πMHz, to
the antenna. The spectrum of the conversion signal registered with heterodyne detection (Extended Data Fig. 1 g) is
presented in the Sup. Fig. 5. We then take parts of the spectrum corresponding to the registered signals and perform
an estimation of cross-spectral density between them using Welch’s method. Then by using a standard normalization
to the geometrical mean of both signals’ power spectral densities obtained with the same method, we arrive with
coherence C. The results are presented in the Sup. Fig. 6.
The coherence measurement ( C= 0.88at zero frequency) corresponds very well with the theoretical limit based on
the signal-to-noise ratio
Cmax=SNR
1 + SNR≈0.89, (4)
constituting a proof of nearly perfect coherence of the presented microwave-to-optical conversion process.19

asSNR = 8 .2(9.2 dB).
S.5 MICROWAVE CONVERTER ACTING AS A MICROWAVE DETECTOR
The proposed scheme could work as a MW detector instead of converter, for example by employing shot-noise
limited heterodyne detection with a local oscillator at the converted signal’s wavelength. We present an exemplary
result of this kind as a spectral characteristics of the output signal in the Extended Data Fig. 1 ein the Methods.
There we show the readout of a signal of around 2.9 mV /cmwith SNR of 13.5 dB. As the signal have a bandwidth
of86 kHz, we may assume a phase noise compensation mechanism and that would yield us a sensitivity of around
2.8µVcm−1Hz−1/2. This result would be comparable with standard Rydberg electrometric sensitivity but well below
the superheterodyne state-of-the-art sensitivity.
However, photon-counting detection, for which the proposed scheme is suitable (and standard electrometric setups
are not due to poor spectral separation of optical fields), entails new type of photonic operations and measurements
that are not possible elsewhere, e.g. the presented autocorrelation measurement. These new types of measurements
are not straightforwardly comparable to the heterodyne measurement, as here we are not subjected to the shot noise
but, as we show, we hit the thermal noise limit (that has not been approached yet in heterodyne detection). In photon-
counting detection the thermal limit is a limit not on the spectral sensitivity of the detection in [µVcm−1Hz−1/2](as
is the case for the shot noise limit in heterodyne detection) but for minimal detectable field in [µV/cm]. If we wanted
to measure electric field using that method, we would arrive at minimal detectable field of 5.5µV/cm, as presented
in the Sup. Tab. II, with SNR of 1 in relation to thermal (and other) noise.
The wide operational bandwidth of the converter is the cause of high level of thermal noise that limits the sensitivity
of the converter employed as an electrometric detector. We could imagine trading the bandwidth’s figure of merit
for the minimal detectable field, e.g. by directing the converted signal via a narrowband ( 20 kHz) tunable cavity –
that would lead us to 170 nVcm−1of thermal field. However, at this level of field we would expect count rate of only
2 phot /s, so it would require special care of other sources of noise. As the non-thermal noise registered with additional
filtering translates to the level of 22 phot /s(as shown in the Fig. 2 a), this would be the expected limit approached in
this realization – resulting in 600 nVcm−1of minimal detectable field.
A more concrete comparison, e.g. with the Ref. [47] is not straightforward, as the detection method is fundamentally
different. In Ref. [47] a heterodyne detection is employed and the limit of the sensitivity – the noise floor – is given
by atomic and technical noises, as claimed by the authors (we think that in most of the realizations the optical shot
noise could also be an important contributing factor there), not the thermal radiation as in our case. Overall, this
means that in homodyne/heterodyne detection quadrature operators of the field are measured ( ˆX,ˆP), while in our
work we use the photon-number operator ˆa†ˆa. We use photon counting, which is independent of the converted light20

frequency – registered photon counts from the thermal radiation correspond to the signal from the whole conversion
bandwidth. This means that, when employing the converter as a field detector, the thermal limit is not a limit on
sensitivity (in [µVcm−1Hz−1/2]) but rather on a minimal detectable field (in [µV/cm]), as the thermal radiation is
integrated over the whole conversion bandwidth.
Regarding the operational dynamic range, e.g. in comparison to Ref. [47], in our setup we claim the lower limit of the
converter’s working range as the minimal detectable field given by the thermal radiation noise floor ( 4·10−10W/m2in
the Fig. 2), and the higher limit as >0.5relative conversion efficiency ( 2·10−4W/m2) – this is 10 dBbelow the atomic
saturation ( 2·10−3W/m2). The lower limit is dependent on the effective detection area, as well as the bandwidth
of the conversion – the effective integration bandwidth of thermal radiation spectral density. We can envisage the
filtering of the converted signal through a narrowband (e.g. 20 kHz) cavity. In that realization we would expect the
detected thermal radiation to be at around 2 phot /s. Then other non-thermal noise at 22 phot /s(as shown in the
Fig. 2 a) would dominate the process, setting the minimal detectable field at 8·10−12W/m2. That would result in
84 dBdynamic range (from the minimal detectable field to atomic saturation) and this result enables a fair comparison
with the heterodyne detection device presented in the Ref. [47]. Though, in this case the instantaneous bandwidth of
the conversion would of course be limited by the bandwidth of the mentioned narrowband cavity.
S.6 SUPPLEMENTARY DISCUSSION ON THE OPTICAL-TO-MICROWAVE CONVERSION
Demonstration of the reverse process of optical-to-microwave conversion is an important topic of research that has
yielded solutions in different systems, Ref. [14, 18, 22, 28, 29, 31]. In our case the reverse conversion should also
be possible, as confirmed by the model [Eq. (1)]. However, as the spontaneous emission branching ratios from the
Rydberg states are not favorable, the emitted MW field would be very weak and difficult to detect in free space. A
clear solution is to couple the atoms to a resonator which confines the MW field and enhances the decay rate on the
MW transition.
