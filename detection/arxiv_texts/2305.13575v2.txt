The generation of ultra-low noise microwave and
mmWave in miniaturized, chip-based platforms
can transform communication, radar, and sens-
ing systems. Optical frequency division that
leverages optical references and optical frequency
combs has emerged as a powerful technique to
generate microwaves with superior spectral pu-
rity than any other approaches. We demonstrate
a miniaturized optical frequency division system
that can potentially transfer the approach to a
CMOS-compatible integrated photonic platform.
Phase stability is provided by a large-mode-
volume, planar-waveguide-based optical reference
coil cavity and is divided down from optical to
mmWave frequency by using soliton microcombs
generated in a waveguide-coupled microres-
onator. Besides achieving record-low phase noise
for integrated photonic microwave/mmWave os-
cillators, these devices can be heterogeneously
integrated with semiconductor lasers, amplifiers,
and photodiodes, holding the potential of large-
volume, low-cost manufacturing for fundamental
and mass-market applications.
Introduction
Microwave and mmWave with high spectral purity are
critical for a wide range of applications, including metrol-
ogy, navigation, and spectroscopy1–3. Due to the supe-
rior fractional frequency stability of reference-cavity sta-
bilized lasers when compared to electrical oscillators4, the
most stable microwave sources are now achieved in opti-
cal systems by using optical frequency division5–8(OFD).
Essential to the division process is an optical frequency
comb9,10, which coherently transfers the fractional sta-
bility of stable references at optical frequencies to the
comb repetition rate at radio frequency. The frequency
division reduces the phase noise spectral density of the
output microwave signal relative to the input optical sig-
nal by the square of the division ratio. A phase noise
reduction greater than 109has been reported5. However,
so far, the most stable microwaves derived from opti-cal frequency division rely on bulk or fiber-based optical
references5–8, hindering the progress of applications in
the field that demand exceedingly low microwave phase
noise.
Integrated photonic microwave oscillators have been
studied intensively for their potential of miniaturiza-
tion and mass-volume fabrication. A variety of pho-
tonic approaches have been shown to generate stable mi-
crowave/mmWave signals, such as direct heterodyne de-
tection of a pair of lasers11, microcavity-based stimulated
Brillouin lasers12,13and soliton microresonator-based fre-
quency combs14–18(microcombs). For solid-state pho-
tonic oscillators, the fractional stability is ultimately lim-
ited by thermorefractive noise, which decreases with the
increase of cavity mode volume19,20. Large-mode-volume
integrated cavities with meter-scale length and >100
million Q-factor have been shown recently21,22to reduce
laser linewidth to Hz-level while maintaining chip foot-
print at centimeter-scale23–25. However, increasing cavity
mode volume reduces the effective intracavity nonlinear-
ity strength and increases the turn-on power for Brillouin
and Kerr parametric oscillation. This trade-off poses a
difficult challenge for an integrated cavity to simulta-
neously achieve high stability and nonlinear oscillation
for microwave generation. For oscillators integrated with
photonic circuits, the best phase noise reported at 10 kHz
offset frequency is demonstrated in the SiN photonic plat-
form, reaching -109 dBc/Hz when the carrier frequency is
scaled to 10 GHz16,23. This is many orders of magnitude
higher than that of the bulk OFD oscillators. An inte-
grated photonic version of optical frequency division can
fundamentally resolve this trade-off, as it allows the use
of two distinct integrated resonators in OFD for differ-
ent purposes: a large mode-volume resonator to provide
exceptional fractional stability and a microresonator for
the generation of soliton microcombs. Together, they can
provide major improvements to the stability of integrated
oscillators.
Here, we significantly advance the state of the art in
photonic microwave/mmWave oscillators by demonstrat-
ing integrated chip-scale optical frequency division. OurarXiv:2305.13575v2  [physics.optics]  31 May 20232
FIG. 1: Conceptual illustration of integrated optical frequency division. (a) Simplified schematic. A pair
of lasers that are stabilized to an integrated coil reference cavity serve as the optical references and provide phase
stability for the mmWave/microwave oscillator. The relative frequency difference of the two reference lasers are
then divided down to the repetition rate of a soliton microcomb by feedback control of the frequency of the laser
that pumps the soliton. High power, low noise mmWave is generated by photodetecting the OFD soliton micro-
comb on a CC-MUTC photodiode. The mmWave can be further divided down to microwave through a mmWave to
microwave frequency division. (b)Photo of critical elements in the integrated OFD. From left to right are: a SiN
4-meter long coil waveguide cavity as an optical reference, a SiN chip with tens of waveguide-coupled ring microres-
onators to generate soliton microcombs, a flip-chip bonded CC-MUTC PD for mmWave generation and a US one

demonstration is based on CMOS-compatible SiN inte-
grated photonic platform26and reaches record-low phase
noise for integrated photonic-based microwave/mmWave
oscillator systems. The oscillator derives its stability
from a pair of commercial semiconductor lasers that are
frequency stabilized to a planar waveguide-based refer-
ence cavity25(Fig. 1). The frequency difference of the
two reference lasers is then divided down to mmWave
with a two-point locking method27,28using an inte-
grated soliton microcombs29,30. While stabilizing soli-
ton microcombs to long-fiber-based optical references has
been shown very recently28,31, its combination with in-
tegrated optical references has not been reported. The
small dimension of microcavities allows soliton repeti-
tion rates to reach mmWave and THz frequencies28,32,33,
which have emerging applications in 5G/6G wireless
communications34,35, radio astronomy36, and radar37.
Low noise, high power mmWaves are generated by
photomixing the OFD soliton microcombs on a high-
speed flip-chip bonded charge-compensated modified uni-
traveling carrier photodiode (CC-MUTC PD)33,38. To
address the challenge of phase noise characterization for
high-frequency signals, a new mmWave to microwave fre-quency division (mmFD) method is developed to mea-
sure mmWave phase noise electrically while outputting a
low-noise auxiliary microwave signal. The generated 100
GHz signal reaches a phase noise of -114 dBc/Hz at 10
kHz offset frequency (equivalent to -134 dBc/Hz for 10
GHz carrier frequency), which is more than two orders of
magnitude better than previous SiN-based photonic mi-
crowave/mmWave oscillators16,23. The ultra-low phase
noise can be maintained while pushing the mmWave out-
put power to 9 dBm (8 mW), which is only 1 dB below the
record for photonic oscillators at 100 GHz39. Pictures of
chip-based reference cavity, soliton-generating microres-
onators, and CC-MUTC PD are shown in Fig. 1b.
Results. The integrated optical reference in our demon-
stration is a thin-film SiN 4-meter-long coil cavity25.
The cavity has a cross-section of 6 µm width ×80 nm
height, a FSR of ∼50 MHz, an intrinsic quality fac-
tor of 41 ×106(41×106) and a loaded quality factor
of 34 ×106(31×106) at 1550 nm (1599 nm). The
coil cavity provides exceptional stability for reference
lasers because of its large mode volume and high-quality
factor. Here, two widely tunable lasers (NewFocus Veloc-3
FIG. 2: Experimental setup. A pair of reference lasers are created by stabilizing frequencies of lasers A and B
to a SiN coil waveguide reference cavity, which is temperature controlled by thermoelectric cooler (TEC). Soliton
microcomb is generated in an integrated SiN microresonator. The pump laser is the first modulation sideband of
a modulated continuous wave (cw) laser, and the sideband frequency can be rapidly tuned by a voltage controlled
oscillator (VCO). To implement two-point locking for optical frequency division, the 0-th comb line (pump laser) is
photomixed with ref. laser A, while the N-th comb line is photomixed with ref. laser B. The two photocurrents are
then subtracted on an electrical mixer to yield the phase difference between the ref. lasers and Ntimes the soliton
repetition rate, which is then used to servo control the soliton repetition rate by controlling the frequency of the
pump laser. The phase noise of the reference lasers and the soliton repetition rate can be measured in the optical
domain by using dual-tone delayed self-heterodyne interferometry. Low noise, high power mmWaves are generated
by detecting soliton microcombs on a CC-MUTC PD. To characterize the mmWave phase noise, a mmWave to mi-
crowave frequency division (mmFD) is implemented to stabilize a 20 GHz VCO to the 100 GHz mmWave, and the
phase noise of the VCO can be directly measured by a phase noise analyzer (PNA). Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers
(EDFAs), polarization controllers (PCs), phase modulators (PMs), single-sideband modulator (SSB-SC), band pass
filters (BPFs), fiber Bragg grating (FBG) filters, line-by-line waveshaper (WS), acoustic-optics modulator (AOM),
and electrical amplifiers (Amps) are also used in the experiment.
ity TLB-6700, laser A and B) are frequency stabilized to
the coil cavity through Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) lock-
ing technique. Their wavelengths can be tuned between
1550 nm ( fA= 193 .4 THz) and 1600 nm ( fB= 187 .4
THz), providing up to 6 THz frequency separation for
optical frequency division. The setup schematic is shown
in Fig.2.
The soliton microcomb is generated in an integrated,
bus-waveguide coupled Si 3N4micro-ring resonator33,40
with a cross-section of 1.55 µm width ×0.8µm height.
The ring resonator has a radius of 228 µm, an FSR of
100 GHz, and an intrinsic (loaded) quality factor of 4.3
×106(3.0×106). The pump laser of the ring resonator
is derived from the first modulation sideband of an ultra-
low noise semiconductor extended distributed Bragg re-
flector (E-DBR) laser from Morton Photonics41, and the
sideband frequency can be rapidly tuned by a voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO). This allows single soliton
generation by implementing rapid frequency sweeping of
the pump laser42, as well as fast servo control of the soli-
ton repetition rate by tuning the VCO28. The optical
spectrum of the soliton microcombs is shown in Fig. 3a,
which has a 3-dB bandwidth of 4.6 THz. The spectra ofreference lasers are also plotted in the same figure.
The optical frequency division is implemented with
the two-point locking method27,28. The two reference
lasers are photomixed with the soliton microcomb on
two separate photodiodes to create beat notes between
the reference lasers and their nearest comb lines. The
beat note frequencies are ∆ 1=fA−(fp+n×fr) and
∆2=fB−(fp+m×fr), where fris the repetition rate
of the soliton, fpis pump laser frequency, and n, m are
the comb line numbers relative to the pump line num-
ber. These two beat notes are then subtracted on an
electrical mixer to yield the frequency and phase differ-
ence between the optical references and Ntimes of the
repetition rate: ∆ = ∆ 1−∆2= (fA−fB)−(N×fr),
where N=n−mis the division ratio. Frequency ∆
is then phase locked to a low-frequency local oscillator
(LO, fLO1) by feedback control of the VCO frequency.
The tuning of VCO frequency directly tunes the pump
laser frequency, which then tunes the soliton repetition
rate through Raman self-frequency shift and dispersive
wave recoil effects15,43,44. The frequency and phase of
the optical references are thus divided down to the soli-
ton repetition rate, as fr= (fA−fB−fLO1)/N. Since4

the LO frequency is in the 10s MHz range and its phase
noise is negligible compared to the optical references, the
phase noise of the soliton repetition rate ( Sr) within the
servo locking bandwidth is determined by that of the op-
tical references ( So):Sr=So/N2.
To test the optical frequency division, the phase noise
of OFD soliton repetition rate is measured for division
ratios of N= 2, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30, and 60. In the
measurement, one reference laser is kept at 1550.1 nm,
while the other reference laser is tuned to a wavelength
that is Nmicroresonator FSR away from the first refer-
ence laser (Fig. 3a). The phase noise of the reference
lasers and soliton microcombs are measured in the op-
tical domain by using dual-tone delayed self-heterodyne
interferometry45,46. In this method, two lasers at differ-
ent frequencies can be sent into an unbalanced Mach-
Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with an acoustic optical
modulator (AOM) in one arm (Fig. 2). Then the two
lasers are separated by a fiber-Bragg grating (FBG) filter
and detected on two different photodiodes. The instan-taneous frequency/phase fluctuations of these two lasers
can be extracted from the photodetector signals by using
Hilbert transform. Using this method, the phase noise of
the phase difference between the two stabilized reference
lasers is measured and shown in Fig. 3b. In this work,
the phase noise of the reference lasers does not reach the
thermal refractive noise limit of the reference cavity25
and is likely to be limited by environmental acoustic and
mechanical noise. For soliton repetition rate phase noise
measurement, a pair of comb lines with comb numbers l
andkare selected by a programmable line-by-line wave-
shaper (WS) and sent into the interferometry. The phase
noise of their phase differences is measured, and its divi-
sion by ( l−k)2yields the soliton repetition rate phase
noise46.
The phase noise measurement results are shown in Fig.
3c,d. The best phase noise for soliton repetition rate
is achieved with a division ratio of 60 and is presented
in Fig. 3c. For comparison, the phase noises of refer-
ence lasers and the repetition rate of free-running soli-5

noise of the VCO after mmFD is directly measured by the phase noise analyzer (dashed green). Scaling this trace

son, phase noises of reference lasers (orange) and OFD soliton repetition rate (blue) measured in the optical domain
are shown. (d)Measured mmWave power versus PD photocurrent at -2 V bias. A maximum mmWave power of 9

ton without OFD are also shown in the figure. Below
100 kHz offset frequency, the phase noise of OFD soli-
ton is roughly 602= 36 dB below that of the reference
lasers and matches very well with the projected phase
noise for optical frequency division (noise of reference
lasers - 36 dB). Phase noises at 1 kHz and 10 kHz offset
frequencies are extracted for all division ratios and are
plotted in Fig. 3d. The phase noises follow the 1 /N2
rule, validating the optical frequency division. The mea-
sured phase noise for OFD soliton repetition rate is re-
markably low for a mmWave oscillator. For comparison,
phase noise of Keysight E8257D PSG signal generator
(standard model) at 1 and 10 kHz are given in Fig. 3d
after scaling the carrier frequency to 100 GHz. At 10 kHz
offset frequency, our integrated OFD oscillator achieves a
phase noise of -115 dBc/Hz, which is 20 dB better than
a standard PSG signal generator. Interestingly, when
comparing to integrated microcomb oscillators that are
stabilized to long optical fibers28, our integrated oscilla-
tor matches the phase noise at 10 kHz offset frequency
and provides better phase noise below 5 kHz offset fre-
quency (carrier frequency scaled to 100 GHz). We spec-
ulate this is because our photonic chip is rigid and small
when compared to fiber references, and thus are less af-
fected by environmental noises like vibration and shock.
This showcases the capability and potential of integrated
photonic oscillators.
The OFD soliton microcomb is then sent to a high-
power, high-speed flip-chip bonded charge-compensated
modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode for mmWavegeneration. Similar to a uni-travelling carrier PD47, the
carrier transport in the CC-MUTC PD depends primar-
ily on fast electrons which provides high speed and re-
duces saturation effects due to space-charge screening.
Power handling is further enhanced by flip-chip bonding
the PD to a gold-plated coplanar waveguide on an alu-
minum nitride (AlN) submount for heat sinking48. The
PD used in this work is an 8- µm diameter CC-MUTC
PD with 0.23 A/W responsivity at 1550 nm wavelength
and a 3-dB bandwidth of 86 GHz. Details of the CC-
MUTC PD are described elsewhere49,50. While the power
characterization of the generated mmWave is straightfor-
ward, phase noise measurement at 100 GHz is not trivial
as the frequency exceeds the bandwidth of most phase
noise analyzers (PNAs). One approach is to build two
identical yet independent oscillators and down-mix the
frequency for phase noise measurement. However, this is
not feasible for us due to the limitation of lab resources.
Instead, a new mmWave to microwave frequency division
method is developed to coherently divide down the 100
GHz mmWave to 20 GHz microwave, which can then be
directly measured on a phase noise analyzer (Fig. 4a).
In this mmWave to microwave frequency division, the
generated 100 GHz mmWave and a 19.7 GHz VCO sig-
nal are sent to a highly nonlinear RF mixer, which cre-
ates higher harmonics of the VCO frequency to mix with
the mmWave. The mixer outputs the frequency differ-
ence between the mmWave and the fifth harmonics of
the VCO frequency: ∆ f=fr−5fVCO2 , and ∆ fis set
to be around 1.16 GHz. ∆ fis then phase locked to a6
stable local oscillator ( fLO2) by feedback control of the
VCO frequency. This stabilizes the frequency and phase
of the VCO to that of the mmWave within the servo
locking bandwidth, as fVCO2 = (fr−fLO2)/5. The elec-
trical spectrum and phase noise of the VCO are then
measured directly on the phase noise analyzer and are
presented in Fig. 4b,c. The phase noise of the 19.7 GHz
VCO can be scaled back to 100 GHz to represent the up-
per bound of the mmWave phase noise. For comparison,
phase noise of reference lasers and OFD soliton repeti-
tion rate measured in the optical domain with dual-tone
delayed self-heterodyne interferometry method are also
plotted. Between 100 Hz to 100 kHz offset frequency,
the phase noise of soliton rep-rate and the generated
mmWave match very well with each other. This vali-
dates the mmFD method and indicates that the phase
stability of the soliton rep-rate is well transferred to the
mmWave. Below 100 Hz offset frequency, measurements
in the optical domain suffer from phase drift in the 200-
meter optical fiber in the interferometry and thus yield
phase noise higher than that measured with the electri-
cal method. Above 100 kHz offset frequency, the mmFD
measured phase noise is limited by the strong mmFD
servo locking bump.
Finally, the mmWave phase noise and power are mea-
sured versus the MUTC PD photocurrent from 1 to 18.3
mA at -2 Volt bias by varying the illuminating optical
power on the PD. While the mmWave power increases
with the photocurrent (Fig. 4d), the phase noise of
the mmWave remains almost the same for all different
photocurrents (Fig. 4e). This suggests that low phase
noise and high power are simultaneously achieved. The
achieved power of 9 dBm is one of the highest powers ever
reported at 100 GHz frequency for photonic oscillators39.
Summary.
In summary, we have demonstrated low noise mmWave
and microwave generation by using integrated optical fre-
quency division. The achieved phase noise is primar-
ily limited by the technical noise in the reference lasers
and can be improved in the future to thermorefractive
noise (TRN) limit of the reference cavity by packaging
the reference cavity to isolate environmental noises25.
Common mode noise cancellation can be further lever-
aged at that point to reduce the relative noise between
the two reference lasers to below the TRN limit. In
addition, interesting developments in vacuum-gap cavi-
ties using microfabricated mirrors have been shown toovercome the TRN limit of planar waveguide reference
cavities51. Chip-based stimulated Brillouin lasers are
useful in reducing phase noise of optical references at high
offset frequency13,52. The division ratio demonstrated
in this work is limited by the frequency range of our
tunable lasers instead of the optical span of the soliton
microcombs. Microcomb-based OFD that leverages 10s
THz optical span or even octave span is possible by us-
ing dispersion-engineered microresonators53,54. Further-
more, recent development in integration of high-Q res-
onators and stress-optic modulator55,56will enable feed-
back control of microresonator frequency for OFD, which
can greatly increase OFD servo bandwidth. Therefore,
despite the fact that our demonstration has improved the
phase noise of integrated photonic microwave/mmWave
oscillators by more than 20 dB, it is feasible to further
advance the phase noise by several orders of magnitude in
the future, allowing integrated photonic oscillators to, in
certain offset frequency range, e.g., 10 kHz, match some
of the best bulk optical OFD oscillators5. Finally, there
is potential for fully integrated OFD oscillators through
heterogeneous integration of SiN reference cavities and
microresonators with other components57, e.g., semicon-
ductor lasers, optical amplifiers, and photodiodes. The
small size and mass of integrated oscillators will also offer
improved performance regarding acceleration and shock.

tention to other integrated SiN optical frequency divi-
sion work58, which was reported while preparing this
