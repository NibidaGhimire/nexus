Abstract
Using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, I noticed that M GAB-V240 = PS1-3PI J185529.82 +323017.8
showed two diﬀerent states: regularly outbursting state wi th a cycle length of 12 d and standstills. I found
that the regularly outbursting state was in fact a sequence o f superoutburst and intervening normal outbursts
comprising a 12-d supercycle. During one of the superoutbur sts, superhumps with a period of 0.015824(9) d
(=22.79 min) were detected in the ZTF time-resolved data. Th is period and behavior have conﬁrmed that
MGAB-V240 is an AM CVn-type object with the shortest known su percycle and the second known AM CVn
star showing genuine standstills. The standstills in this s ystem were interrupted by short drops and the system
often brightened after these drops. This phenomenon can be e xplained by the accumulation of the transferred
matter in the outer part of the disk during the drops. This phe nomenon favors a constant mass-transfer
from the secondary combined with the diﬃculty in maintainin g the hot state in a helium disk rather than a
temporary decrease of the mass-transfer rate as the cause of these drops. MGAB-V240 should be close to the
border of the thermal instability of a helium disk, and the ob served superhump period agrees very well with
the activity sequence expected by the disk instability theo ry and the evolutionary sequence of AM CVn stars.
MGAB-V240 was discovered as a faint SS Cyg-type dwarf nova wi th frequent outbursts.1The object had
also been selected as a candidate RR Lyr star (PS1-3PI J18552 9.82+323017.8, Sesar et al. 2017).2I used Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF: Masci et al. 2019)3data and found that this object showed standstills in 2020 an d 2022.
The long-term light curves containing a regularly outburst ing part (2018–2019) and a state with standstills and
outbursts (2020–2022) are shown in ﬁgures 1 and 2, respectiv ely. A naïve look at these ﬁgures would simply
re-classify the object as an Z Cam star [for cataclysmic vari ables and their subclasses, see e.g., Warner (1995)]. I,
however, noticed that the object showed sudden drops during the 2022 standstill (ﬁgure 3), which is unusual for a
Z Cam-type dwarf nova (vsnet-chat 9317).4One or two drops were also recorded during the 2020 standstil l. The
fading rates of these sudden drops were sometimes close to 2 m ag d−1, whose large value is one of the signatures
of AM CVn-type outbursts (Kato and Kojiguchi 2021) [for a rev iew of AM CVn stars, see e.g., Solheim (2010)].
Upon a closer look at the ZTF light curve of the regularly outb ursting part, I found short outbursts between
long outbursts (ﬁgure 4). This is a clear indication of an SU U Ma-type supercycle (long outbursts and short
outbursts between them). Superhumps with a period of 0.0158 24(9) d were indeed detected from the ZTF time-
resolved data during one of long outbursts (ﬁgure 5). The err or of the period was estimated by the methods of
Fernie (1989) and Kato et al. (2010). The overall light curve of the 2018–2019 season resembles that of ASASSN-
14cc (Kato et al. 2015). Kato et al. (2015) detected a supercy cle of 21–33 d together with superhumps with period
of 0.01560–0.01562 d by a network of ground-based small tele scopes aiming at ASASSN-14cc under a VSNET
(Kato et al. 2004) campaign. This period was conﬁrmed by TESS photometry (Pichardo Marcano et al. 2021).
Kato et al. (2015) suggested that ASASSN-14cc showed a super cycle similar to the hydrogen-rich system RZ LMi.
RZ LMi typically has a supercycle of 19 d (Robertson et al. 199 5; Nogami et al. 1995; Olech et al. 2008), but
showed a short standstill in 2016 (Kato et al. 2016). Such a sh ort supercycle could not be naturally reproduced
(Osaki 1995a,b) by the thermal-tidal instability model (Os aki 1989, 1996), which successfully explained the
supercycles of most SU UMa stars. Osaki (1995b) explained th e short supercycle by artiﬁcially quenching the
superoutburst when the accretion disk is still large. This t reatment led to an idea of decoupling between the
thermal and tidal instabilities (Hellier 2001).
The present observations of MGAB-V240 make this object as a p erfect helium analog (although no spectrum
has been obtained, the short superhump period is an unambigu ous signature of an AM CVn-type object) of the
hydrogen-rich RZ LMi: a short-period supercycle and stands tills. True standstills in AM CVn stars have been
very rare and this object becomes the second well-establish ed example after CR Boo (Kato et al. 2023). The
suggested type is SU UMa(ER UMa)+Z Cam+AM CVn.

2Although the name PS1-3PI J185529.82 +323017.8 would be adequate considering the priority in disc overy, I use MGAB-V240
in this paper because of its brevity.

Figure 1: Light curve of MGAB-V240 in 2018–2019. The object s howed a regular pattern of outbursts recurring
with a period of ∼12 d. They turned out to be superoutbursts, not SS Cyg-type ou tbursts (see text).
In AM CVn stars, an RZ LMi-like short supercycle would be more easily achieved than in hydrogen-rich
systems for two reasons: (1) Helium disks require a higher te mperature to maintain the hot state and a cooling
wave starts more easily than in hydrogen-rich systems. (2) A M CVn stars have (usually) lower mass ratios than
in hydrogen-rich systems, which would make decoupling betw een the thermal and tidal instabilities easier to
happen [For the disk-instability model of AM CVn stars, see T sugawa and Osaki (1997); Solheim (2010); Kotko
et al. (2012)]. Drops from standstills may be caused by the di ﬃculty (relative to hydrogen-rich systems) in
maintaining the hot state. In contrast to most (hydrogen-ri ch) Z Cam stars, these drops were often followed by
short brightening (after the initial three drops in ﬁgure 4) . This phenomenon can be interpreted as follows: The
mass transfer from the secondary and the mass accretion to th e primary are balanced during the standstill. Once
a cooling wave starts, the mass accretion to the primary decr eases and the mass accumulates (if the mass-transfer
rate is constant) during these drops in the outer part of the d isk, and this extra mass causes brightening when
the disk becomes hot again. The phenomenon observed in stand stills of MGAB-V240 excludes the possibility of
a temporary decrease of the mass-transfer rate as the cause o f the drops; rather the constant mass-transfer rate
is favored to explain brightening after the drops.
The superhump period of 0.015824 d, which is usually ∼1% longer than the orbital period ( Porb) in AM CVn
stars, in MGAB-V240 is between the thermally unstable dwarf nova-type CR Boo ( Porb=0.017029 d: Provencal
et al. 1997) and the thermally stable novalike-type HP Lib ( Porb=0.012763 d: Patterson et al. 2002; Roelofs et al.
2007) among AM CVn stars and follows the activity sequence ex pected by the disk instability theory and the
evolutionary sequence of AM CVn stars (Tsugawa and Osaki 199 7; Kotko et al. 2012).
