ABSTRACT
Rotating radio transients (RRATs) are neutron stars that emit detectable radio bursts sporadically. They are statistically distinct
intheneutronstarpopulation,inmanyobservableproperties,butbytheirnaturearepracticallydifficulttostudyindepth.Inthis
paper,wepresenttheresultsfrom 1408 hofobservationsofRRATcandidatesusingtheIrishstationoftheLowFrequencyArray
(LOFAR) at 150 MHz. As of October 2022, this census involved observing 113sources, leading to 29detections which were
then followed up systematically. Single-pulse emission was detected from 25sources, and periodic emission from 14sources.
18sources were found to have emission behaviour that is not discussed in prior works using LOFAR instruments. Four novel
or modified source periods have been determined, ranging from 1.5–3.9 s, and 8new or updated phase-coherent pulsar timing
ephemerideshavebeenproducedusingdetectedbursts.Oneunexpectedsingle-pulsewithaclearly-Galacticdispersionmeasure
was detectedas apart ofthis work,but hasnot beenre-detected infollow-up observations.Observations areongoing toexpand
the number of observed sources and further characterise and improve ephemerides for the detected sources. This census has
demonstrated the capability for international LOFAR stations to detect, monitor and characterise a significant fraction of these
unique sources.

1 INTRODUCTION
The majority of the over 3380 known radio pulsars1have been dis-
covered through searches for periodic emission, and the majority of
thesethroughincoherentFourier-basedmethods(Lorimer&Kramer
2012). Although pulsars rotate in a reliable manner (Hobbs et al.
2012) they do not emit identical pulses each rotation and there is a
large variety to the pulse amplitude distributions observed (Burke-
Spolaor et al. 2011). Rotating Radio Transient (RRAT) is the name
generally given to any pulsar with a pulse amplitude distribution
suchthatitismoresignificantly,oronly,detectablethroughsearches
for individual bright pulses, as opposed to via periodicity-based
searches (McLaughlin et al. 2006; Keane & McLaughlin 2011).
Fourier-based searches select against long-period pulsars; if er-
ratic emission in pulsars increases with age, then that would be
anadditional compoundingselectioneffectagainstlong-periodpul-
sars. Also, as real-world telescope data has a red noise characteris-
tic (Keane et al. 2018), this further compounds the selection effect
against pulsars with periods longer than ∼1s.

population. But in order to gain a complete understanding of the
pulsarpopulation,anditsevolution,selectioneffectsintheobserved
population must be understood and appropriately accounted for. To
this end large-scale blind surveys across a broad spectral range are
needed; these can counteract spectral selection effects which can be
co-variantwithotherparameters(Batesetal.2013).Further,awide
range of search techniques must be applied to these data with sin-
gle pulse searches (Cordes & McLaughlin 2003), and fast folding

etal.2020),asubsectionofwhichfallintothedefinitionofaRRAT.
While the number of RRATs has been increasing in recent years,
there has been a dearth of follow-up observations. Such follow-up
timing is essential to properly characterise these sources, but due
to the instantaneous sensitivity and observing time required to see
sufficient individual pulses, only certain over-subscribed telescopes
have been considered suitable. Consequently, as of early 2023, the
vast majority of RRATs in the ATNF pulsar catalogue (Manchester
et al. 2005) lack a precise rotation period, and only a third have a

often in their underlying properties, the lack of characterisation for
the majority of these neutrons stars may be severely hampering ef-
forts to understand the true pulsar population and its evolutionary
track(s). Therefore, it might be expected that characterising RRATs
wouldhaveadisproportionatelylargeimpactondisentanglingofthe

2 SOURCE SELECTION
There are a number of catalogues in the public domain which de-
scribeRRATs;eachoftheseisdetailedandupdatedheterogeneously.
The sources chosen for this study come from three of these cata-
logues. (i) With a focus on RRATs detected in the Northern Hemi-
sphere(atacentralfrequencyof 600 MHz),thecataloguesprovided
by the CHIME/FRB collaboration2are referred to herein as the
“CHIME/FRBcatalogue”.ThesearediscussedindetailinGoodetal.
2021 and Dong et al. 2022 (herein G21 and D23); (ii) the catalogue
of the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory3(at111 MHz), is
referred to herein as the “PRAO catalogue”. This has most recently
beenupdatedinSamodurovetal.(2022);and(iii)TheWestVirginia

sive catalogue of sources combined from the announcements from

ber of sources included in the census, with a goal to maximise the
scientific potential of the allocated observing time. However, some
sources that did not meet the typical observing requirements, but
which were present at a celestial longitude where there is a dearth
of sources, were additionally observed in time that otherwise would
not have been allocated on the telescope.
2.1 The CHIME/FRB Galactic Catalogue
The CHIME/FRB catalogue contains sources discovered with the
Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (Bandura et al.
2014), a zenith scanning array that it is focused on mapping hydro-
gen in the local universe. CHIME has additional back-ends for FRB
and pulsar studies, which have helped it become a pivotal instru-
ment in the recent developments in these fields (Amiri et al. 2021;
CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. 2021). These back-ends have al-
lowedittoquicklybecomeoneofthemostproductivetelescopesfor
single-pulse detection and folded pulsar observations due to its sen-
sitivity, field of view, large fractional bandwidth and high-cadence
observingacrosstheentireNorthernHemisphere.Thenovelsources
discoveredbythesebackendsarecollectedandpublishedwithinthis
catalogue.
Thiscataloguecontained38sourcesatthetimeofthiscensus,4of
which were presented with candidate plots for pulsars with periodic
emission rather than sources of single-pulse emission. All of these
sources were observed as a part of this campaign.
While the catalogue does not provide uncertainties on their mea-
surements, they can be inferred from the results presented in G21.
Depending on the activity of the sources in this catalogue, their
positional uncertainties are mostly on the order of minutes and ar-
cminutes (for both timed and untimed sources, e.g. J1931+4229 did
not have a known rotation period and has a similar uncertainty on
its parameters to the other sources presented), while 2 of the pe-
riodic sources have been localised to sub-arcsecond positions. The
dispersion measures (DMs) presented in the catalogue have uncer-
tainties on the order of 0.1–1 pc cm−3, reduced from the underlying
2𝑖×1.62 pc cm−3CHIME/FRBtrialsampling,and,whereprovided,
the periods were found to be accurate.

strong candidate for follow-up observations on the brighter sources

of the source (see §3.3 for further details). Accounting for this, 41
sourcesfromthiscatalogue(andthefoursourcesdiscussedin§2.4)
were observed as a part of the census, with one source, J2018 −07,
not observed due to its low declination.
SeveralsourcesfromthePRAOcatalogueweredetectedduringthe
LOTAAS survey, and were reported to have both primarily periodic
(J0317+1328, J1132+2513, J1404+1159) and single pulse emission
(J0139+3336). These sources were observed as a part of the census
to further gauge the capabilities of an international LOFAR station
as compared to the 8 LOFAR core stations that were coherently
beam-formedasapartoftheLOTAASsurvey(Sanidasetal.2019).
2.3 The RRATalog
The RRATalog is a catalogue maintained by Cui and McLaughlin
at West Virginia University, last updated in 2017, of previously an-
nounced RRAT sources from a wide variety of surveys. It contains
sources detected during the multiple surveys performed over the
past two decades using several telescopes, such as those at Arecibo,
Parkes, and Green Bank. Some sources detected using the Green
BanktelescopehavepreviouslybeenfollowedupattheLOFARcore
(Karako-Argaman et al. 2015, herein referred to as K15).
With the large number of ‘traditional’ surveys consisting of tes-
sellatedpointingswithnarrowbeamsformingthefoundationofthis
catalogue, it contains significantly lower uncertainties on positions
and dispersion measures as compared to the catalogues discussed
previously. Further, many of the sources have received full follow-
up campaigns, allowing for their parameters to be constrained even
further.
Alargefractionofthesourcesinthecataloguebelowadeclination

excluded sources are grouped around a small region of the sky near
the Galactic plane, and have relatively low peak flux densities. This
regionoftheskyalreadyrepresentsthelocationwherethesensitivity
ofI–LOFARisreducedduetothelowpeakelevationsofthesources
during their transits, and the scaling of the sky temperature of the
Galacticdisktolowfrequencies(generallydiscussedin§3.3).Itwas
concluded that it would be unlikely these sources would be detected
in the several months of observations it would take to follow up the
18 sources that were not observed as a result of this constraint.
After this filtering, 39 sources were observed from this catalogue
as a part of this census.
This catalogue acts as a strong foundation for observers looking
to dive into the world of RRATs, however there are several errata
regarding entries in the catalogue, while some RRATs reported by
thereferencedsurveyswithdiscoverydatesasfarbackas2014were
found to be missing from the database. These were noted as this
censusprogressed,withsomeadditionalsourcesfromthesesurveys

J1130+09 of the CHIME/FRB catalogue and J1132+0921 of the
PRAOcataloguehaveanangularseparationof 0.2◦withoverlapping
positional uncertainties, and have observed dispersion measures of
22.4 and 22(2)pc cm−3. Due to the reasonably large separation be-
tween the reported positions and low demands for telescope time at
this source’s right ascension, both pointings were observed, though
neither resulted in a detection.
J1848+1518ofthePRAOcatalogueandJ1849+15oftheRRATa-
log(originallydetectedbytheGreenBankTelescope)aresuspected
to be the same source for similar reasons (see further discussion in
Tyul’bashev et al. 2018). The ephemeris produced from a timing
campaignperformedattheLOFARcore(J1848+1516)wasusedfor
observing this source.
During the later stages of the census, the PRAO catalogue was
updated with results from Samodurov et al. (2022) to include two
more sources, J1929+42 and J2214+45, that closely matched the
location and dispersion measure properties of sources previously
announced by CHIME, J1931+4229 and J2215+45. These sources
had been monitored with I–LOFAR for several months at the time

ters,consequentlythePRAOreportedpositionswerenotspecifically
observed as a result.
3 OBSERVATIONS AND METHODOLOGY
3.1 Census Strategy
Each source was observed for a minimum of 5 h, typically in obser-
vations that ranged from 30–90 mincentred near their transit time.
When studying RRATs, longer total observation times increase the
chance of brighter (detectable) pulses occurring, with the exact im-
provement dependent on the (typically unknown) pulse amplitude
distributions. Five hours was chosen as a meaningful compromise
between (a) probing sufficiently deep into the pulse-amplitude dis-
tribution of the sources given the sensitivity of the instrument, (b)
investigatingpotentiallylowburst-ratesourcesemittinginamanner
followingPoissonstatistics,and(c)thedesiretocompletethecensus
in a reasonable time.
3.2 Observing with I–LOFAR
I–LOFARisoneof14stationsthatmakeuptheextendedbaselinesof

with different configurations in the Netherlands (van Haarlem et al.

For32–48 hper week, it is operated by the Irish LOFAR Con-
sortium5in ‘local mode’, whereby astronomers can apply to use the
station for standalone or coordinated observations. It is during this
timethatthiscensuswasperformed,withdataprocessedontheReal-

I–LOFAR is located in a relatively radio-quiet zone as compared
to the rest of the stations spread across Europe. The low local pop-
ulation density alongside the lack of digital audio broadcast (DAB)
radio in Ireland significantly reduced the radio frequency interfer-
ence (RFI) present during observations, though typically 7–20 per
centofthetotalbandwidthisstillflaggedduringobservationsdueto
transient RFI, the FM-radio band and to reduce noise contributions
from filtered regions near the edge of the observed bandwidth.

Theantennaandelectronicstemperatures( 𝑇ant)aresampledbased
upon measurements by Wĳnholds & van Cappellen (2011), and are
averaged across 5 MHzbandwidth blocks.
The sky temperatures ( 𝑇sky) are calculated by performing a con-
volution between a 2D Gaussian function representing the approxi-
mated central component of the telescope beam, including a width
correction factor of 1.02 (van Haarlem et al. 2013, Table B.1), with
the region of the Low Frequency Sky Model (Dowell et al. 2017,
LFSM), as sampled using pygdsm(Price 2016). The LOFAR beam
width and sky temperature are sampled in 5 MHzblocks, which are
then fit by a power law that is sampled to determine the sky tem-
peratureforthefrequency-variablebeamsize.The 𝑇skyvariablewas
found to have a minimum, median, and maximum of 205 K,444 K
and2006 Kat150 MHz forthecorpusofsourcesobservedduringthe
census. The corresponding sensitivity limits for the I–LOFAR tele-
scope for single pulses and periodic emission at these temperatures
are given in Table 1 and 2.
While the recent work of Price (2021) has indicated the advan-
tages of using diffuse global sky models to determine more accu-
rate measurements of 𝑇skyfor pulsar and FRB studies, Price notes
that across the bandwidth used in this work the uncertainty is kept
within a few per cent as the spectral index will only vary between
𝛼=−2.43,−2.53near the Galactic plane. However, it was noted
that the extra Gaussian convolution step, introduced to account for
the wide and variable beam width of a single international LOFAR
station, had a significantly larger effect on the effective spectral in-
dex associated with 𝑇skythan expected. After fitting the modelled
sky temperatures to a power law, the index 𝛼was found to vary
significantlymorethanexpected,withamaximum,medianandmin-
imum fit of 𝛼=−2.29,−2.58,−2.83observed across the sampled

termisfoundtobebelow 1percentacrosstheobservedbandwidth,
as a result of the large contributions of 𝑇antfrom each antenna that
comprises the LOFAR interferometer.
For single pulses, the pulse width used is determined through
SNR optimisation for the bandwidth-flattened 1D pulse profile that
has been dedispersed to the optimal dispersion measure determined
across all pulses observed at the end of the census.
SNRs are calculated in windows of 10 MHz, with the upper and
lower components of the observation bandwidth discarded due to
the sensitivity fall-off due to the pass-band of the electronics and
the large amount of RFI due to the FM radio band near 100 MHz.
Consequently, statistics are generated over the bandwidth between
116–186 MHz, centred on 151 MHz. An equivalent flux density is
thencalculatedforeachsegmentofthebandwidth.Thesefrequency
dependant flux densities were fit to a power law to determine the
spectral indices for detected sources. This fit is performed across

3.4 Observation Processing and Archiving
The raw data from the station is processed into Stokes 𝐼SigProc fil-
terbanks(Lorimer2011)usingamodifiedversion6ofCDMT(Bassa
et al. 2017), to perform coherent dedispersion, channelisation, tem-
poral downsampling and detection to Stokes 𝐼on the Nvidia Tesla
V100s present in the REALTA compute cluster.
Coherent dedispersion reduces the effect of temporal smearing
of an incoming pulsar signal by performing a convolution between
the station voltages and the predicted inverse transfer function for
the interstellar medium at a given dispersion measure. Initially, the
dispersion measure is taken from the source catalogue, but where
observationswithI–LOFARconstrainedasourcedispersionmeasure
further,thedispersionmeasureisupdatedandusedforre-processing
voltages and future observations.
Channelisation was performed to reduce the bandwidth of the
subbands by a factor of 8, increasing the number of channels in
the output data and allowing for a more accurate measurement of
dispersion measure when a pulse is detected.

PacketManager(McKennaetal.2023)ratherthanCOBALT(2)correlatedH5
files, see https://github.com/David-McKenna/cdmtThe data is down-sampled in time by a factor of 16 as a com-
pute and storage saving procedure. This is not considered to have
a negative effect on the data due to three main considerations, (a)

atlowfrequenciesthesepulsesareheavilyscattered,withscattering
behaviour often scaling strongly with frequency, roughly following
𝜈−4(see Lang 1971; Krishnakumar et al. 2017), further broadening
the pulses. As a result, the sub-millisecond sampling available after
this down-sampling step is still more than sufficient to detect and
analyse the morphology of the pulses observed when a sufficiently
bright signal is detected.
The resulting filterbank is a 32-bit floating point file with 3904
channels,withbandwidthsof 24.41 kHzeach,and 655.36µstempo-
ral sampling. However, in the case that a source has been observed
as a part of the census and after the 5 hof observations there has
been no detections, either single pulse or periodic, the filterbank is
re-sampled to reduce the number of channels by a factor of 8, re-
turning them to the original resolution of the telescope, resulting in
channel widths of 195.3126 kHz . In all cases, the final filterbank is
compressedusingzstandard7forafurther5–10percentspace-saving
and archived.
Prior to processing, the 32-bit filterbanks are re-sampled using
DSPSR’s digifil tool (van Straten & Bailes 2011), removing the
bandpass contributions across the default 10-s re-scale interval and
reducing the data to 8–bit samples, which are computationally eas-
ier to analyse. The reduced bit depth further dampens any excess
contributions of spurious RFI samples to dedispersed time series.
All observations undergo a single-pulse search using the GPU-
accelerated heimdall software (Barsdell 2012), with a more sensi-
tivesearch(witha0.3percentlossofsignalperdispersionmeasure
trial)overarangeof 10–20 pc cm−3centredontheknowndispersion
measure of the source, and a less sensitive search (with a 3 per cent
loss of signal per trial) across the 10–500 pc cm−3range to search
for unexpected signals in the data. The lower limit of 10 pc cm−3
was chosen to discard numerous spurious candidates from RFI and
ionospheric scintillation, while the upper limit was initially set to
200 pc cm−3toconsiderthelimitationsassociatedwithobservations
of high dispersion measure sources at low frequencies (see § 5.1.1),
but was expanded to 500 pc cm−3due to the minimal additional
compute cost.

searches were not a component of the main processing pipeline for
the census observations (but see §5.2.5, §6).
3.5 Single Pulse Analysis
Single pulses are extracted and pre-processed using a combination
of DSPSR and PSRCHIVE (Hotan et al. 2004). DSPSR’s digifil
is used to extract a small block of time around a candidate arrival
time8, and re-sampled from 32-bit floats to 8-bit unsigned chars,
removingthebandpassoffsetintheprocess. dspsrthendedisperses
thisfilterbank,performsspectralkurtosisforRFIflaggingandwrites
an output in the TIMER format. This is initially only performed
for visually approved candidates with a SNR above 7.5, but once
a source has been well constrained through detections in multiple
observations, this criterion is reduced to a SNR of 7.
PSRCHIVE’s paztoolisthenusedtoperformfurtherRFIzapping
based on outlying channels in a windowed scan across the bandpass
of the 32-bit data, to ensure no badly contaminated channels are
included in the output pulse archive.
Theoverallpulsepopulationsarethenanalysedtodeterminetheir
properties.Namely,spectralbrightness,pulsewidths,burstratesand
pulse amplitude distribution. Where noted, fitting is performed in
Python using the least-squares method implemented by the lmfit
(Newville et al. 2021) module, which is also the source of any as-
sociated uncertainties (which are 1 𝜎). These results can be found
in Table 3. Pulse population analysis that includes model fitting was
only performed on sources with more than 40 pulses, as sources
withlessobservedpulseswerenotfoundtobewelldescribedbythe
models used for fitting.
The spectral properties of the pulses are calculated by fitting a
power law to the spectral flux densities of each pulse determined
usingEq.1,andaGaussianisfittotheoveralldistributionofpower
law exponents across the observed pulses. The mean term of the
Gaussian and its uncertainty is reported as the single-pulse spectral
index in Table 3.
Pulse amplitude distributions were analysed by fitting multiple
models (power law, broken power law, log–normal, powerlaw–log–
normal and log–normal–powerlaw) to the distribution of frequency-
averaged flux densities of observed pulses. From these models, the
small-N corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) was used to

side of a pulse.determine the best fit model. The fit values for these properties are
presented accordingly in Fig. 3 and Table D1.
Pulse widths and dispersion measures were determined with
PSRCHIVE’s pdmp. The measured dispersion measures were well-
fit by a Gaussian distribution, however pulse widths did not form a
smooth distribution. As a result, the mean and standard deviation
of the widths has been presented, rather than parameters from a
Gaussian fit.
3.6 Timing
Using the single-pulse archive produced by dspsras described in
the previous section, PSRCHIVE’s patgenerates a per-pulse time
of arrival (TOA) measurement using an analytical profile generated
using the brightest pulse and the paastool as a standard reference.
tempo2(Hobbs et al. 2006) is then used to model and update the
source ephemeris using all times of arrival of a source. Some TOAs
of low-significance pulses (SNR ranging from 7 to 7.5) are often
rejected at this stage due to unexpectedly large uncertainties, large
phaseoffsetsorotherunexpectedphenomena.Thesecasesareoften
caused by unflagged RFI or unexpected behaviour in the underlying
dataset, most of which can be fixed through manually re-processing
the pulse archives.
Where sources have not yet been published in psrcat, the pro-
videdsourcecatalogueswereusedtogenerateanephemerisforeach
source, which was then used as a basis for timing. When a source
with only a known period (and no derivative) was observed to have
more than 3 pulses in an observation, the times of arrival were used
to brute force a new period near the previously published result9,
which was then used for timing.
Whenmorethan6pulseswereseenforasourcewithoutaperiod,
it is possible to use the same brute force approach to determine an
underlying periodicity of the pulses. With 6 pulses, each generated
candidate has a 2𝜎likelihood of representing the source’s rotation,
assumingthepulsesfallwithinanarrowphasewindow,with9pulses
reaching a 3𝜎likelihood (Cui et al. 2017, Fig. 2). The candidate
periods were then tested and refined by using prior TOAs to find
the period that represents the greatest common divisor across all
observed TOAs, which was then used for timing the source with
tempo2.
3.7 Periodic Emission Analysis
In the case that a source was found to emit periodic emission with a
SNRgreaterthan7inthepreviouslydescribedPRESTO prepfold
search,theobservationsofthesourcewerefoldedandanalysedusing
DSPSRandPSRCHIVE to prepare folded archives with integration

3.8 Archival Data Follow-up

from the LOTAAS survey (Sanidas et al. 2019) were downloaded

Fromthe 113sourcesinthiscensus, 29sourcesweredetectedinsome

while 14produced sufficient emission to be detected as a periodic

The detected sources cover dispersion measures from 8.5–

MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2023)8D. J. McKenna et al.Table 3. A summary of the properties of the 29sources detected as a part of this census, based on both single-pulse and periodic emission. Data across 116–186 MHz, centered on 151 MHz, are analysed and
presented from observations that started in August 2020 and ended in September 2022. Each source notes their source catalogue ( CHIME,Pushchino, or RRAatalog), the reference to any previous work related to
the source with LOFAR, the known rotation period of the source, best-fit dispersion measure (from single-pulse emission, or periodic emission if single-pulses were not observed) and the number of hours each
source was observed for. Basic parameters regarding the single-pulse emission and periodic emission during the observations are provided (notably 𝑤50, the 50 per cent emission brightness width, and 𝛼𝑠𝑝or𝛼𝑓,
the spectral index for single-pulse or periodic emission). Additionally, the single-pulse emission provides the number of pulses observed, the ratio between the brightest and quietest observed pulses (SR), and the
effective burst rate for each source.

aThe standard uncertainty on all LOFAR flux density measurements is 50 per cent, see §3.3.
bSpectral indices are expected to be biased towards more negative values due to the positional uncertainty of the sources, as the telescope beam FWHM will increase the effective gain for emission at lower
frequencies, see §3.3.

described in §3.4. The burst rates of detected sources can be found
in column three of Table 5.
From the novel detections, pointing near J0054+6650,
J0746+5514, J1006+3015, J1336+3414, J1400+2125 and
J2215+4524 were found to contain at least 1 pulse at the pre-
viously described detection criteria. Apart from J1400+2125, these
sources were observed to have burst rates in excess of 1 h−1at
I–LOFAR,makingtheprobabilityoftheirdetectionmorefavourable
during the LOTAAS survey. From the non-detected sources, only
J0209+33 and J1931+4229 met the same burst rate criteria, with
many of the other sources producing bursts extremely infrequently.
Notably, while J2202+2134 was previously only reported as a
source of periodic emission in S19, 1 pulse was detected in the
archival pointing.
4.2 Sources With Periodic Emission
Of the 14sources that were detected through periodic emis-
sion, 7sources (J0209+5759, J0226+3356, J0854+5449, J2105+19,
J2108+4516, J2215+4524, J2325 −0530) have not previously been
discussed in any LOFAR works, while J1538+2345 has only been
discussed in a single-pulse context by K15 (this source is not dis-
cussed in S19 as the survey pointing had not been performed at the
timeofpublication).Theremaining6sourceswerereportedasnovel

J0209+5759 is a nulling pulsar reported by G21, which placed
a lower limit on the nulling fraction of the source of 0.21 due to
thelimitedobservingwindowsoftheCHIMEinstrument.I–LOFAR
is able to detect blocks of emission after periodic folding at the
nominal frequency that align with observed single-pulses. Using
PSRSALSA (Weltevrede 2016) to analyse 26 hours of data in 30-
second sub-integrations, the nulling fraction can be estimated to be
0.953(4)fora3-sigmadetectionthreshold,or0.971(3)fora4-sigma

From the 6 sources not previously detected with LOFAR instru-
mentsthathavenearbyLOTAASpointings,thesurveypointingsfor
J0226+3356, J0854+5449 and J2215+4524 show evidence of weak
periodic emission, though at signal-to-noise levels that were below
the detection threshold for the survey. The signal-to-noise ratios of
detected sources can be found in column four of Table 5.
J2108+4516 was not detected in the LOTAAS pointing despite
significant brightness reported in this work, though this is to be
expectedgivenG21reportedthissourceisaneclipsingbinarypulsar,
and is only visible during narrow windows of the system’s orbit.

J0209+5759 showed similar behaviour to observations performed

4.3 Novel Source Rotation Periods
Fromthe 25sourceswithdetectablesingle-pulseemission,9sources
did not have a known period when initially observed during this
census (J0348+79, J0939+45, J1006+3015, J1218+47, J1329+13,
J1400+2125,J1931+4229,J2105+19andJ2138+69).Threeofthese

be found in Tables 3 and 4. The reported period of J2105+19 is
refined from the recent report of 3.5297 sfrom Tyul’bashev et al.
(2022), as determined from an observation with the LOFAR core in
June 2021, which will be discussed in future work (McKenna et al.
prep).
In the cases of J1006+3015 and J1931+4229, long enough ob-
servations of the sources in a single observing session were able
to generate a sufficient number of times of arrival to determine the
underlying source period through the standard brute force method.
J1400+2125 required a brute force on the differences in times of
arrival, generated from two sets of single–pulses observed across
observations on two sequential days.
The rotation period of PSR J1336+3414 was also found to differ
by a factor of 2 from the published rotation period of 3.013 s, at
1.5066 s. This is discussed further in §5.2.6.

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Source Properties and Detectability
5.1.1 Source Dispersion Measures
As seen in Fig. 2, both the RRAT population as a whole, and the
subgroup detected by the census is heavily biased towards lower
dispersion measures, with only 6 of the detected source having a
dispersion measure above 40 pc cm−3.
This is likely a result of the scattering caused by inhomogeneities
inthemediumalongthelineofsightbetweentheobservingtelescope
and the neutron star, causing the pulse emission to be dispersed in
time (reducing the pulse SNR proportionally by this timescale,√𝑡)
and fall below the noise floor of the instrument as a result.
Scattering effects are particularly strong at the lower frequencies
used by many of the telescopes behind the catalogues used for this
census. As described in Cordes (2002), the scattering timescale of
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2023)RRATs with I–LOFAR 13
a radio pulsar is dependent on the dispersion measure ( log𝜏sc∼
logDM+(logDM)2) and observing frequency ( 𝜏∼𝜈−4). While
lowerdispersionmeasuresourcesarestilldetectable,highdispersion
measurescausethepulsestobebroadenedbyanorderofmagnitude
or even more in time. Using Eq. 10 of Cordes, we can estimate the
scatter broadening of a RRAT with a dispersion measure of 10, 30,
100 and 300 pc cm−3observed at 150 MHz to be 0.02, 0.29, 24 and
4100 ms. With the described frequency scaling, these are expected
to be more than three orders of magnitude larger at 150 MHz as
compared to L-band ( 1.5 GHz), and nearly 30 times larger than at
P-band ( 400 MHz).
Given the typical brightness of these sources, the sensitivity of
I–LOFAR, and typical observed pulse widths from these sources at
higherfrequencies,thepotentialtodetectaRRATwithadispersion
measure beyond 100 pc cm−3is highly unlikely.
Similarly, these high dispersion measure sources must be close to
theGalacticplaneduetothesharpfalloffoffreeelectronsawayfrom
the Galactic disk. As previously described, the disk also resulted in
significantly higher 𝑇skymeasurements, which can severely hamper
the instantaneous sensitivity of I–LOFAR towards these sources,
which is a further compounding effect that reduces the detectability
of these sources.
5.1.2 Source Rotation Periods
AsseeninFig.1,themajorityofthesourcesobservedbutundetected
in this census do not have a known rotation period. This is to be
expectedasinorderfortheperiodofaRRATtobedetermineditmust
produce pulses that are sufficiently bright to meet the detectability
criteriaoftheobservingtelescope,andhaveasufficientburstrateat
that sensitivity for multiple time-of-arrival measurements in a short
window of time to allow for a rotation period to be brute-forced.
Observations with I–LOFAR over a 5-hour window may not have
beensufficienttimetodetectasinglepulseinthecasethatthepulse-
amplitudedistributionhasasufficientlylong,butlow-probabilitytail
to produce pulses within our sensitivity range.
Whilelongerperiodsourcesmayhavebeenabletooffsettheeffects
of scattering discussed in §5.1.1 due to wider intrinsic pulse widths
at typical duty cycles, fewer rotations of the pulsar are observed,
reducing the number of samples taken from the tail of the pulse
amplitude distribution.
5.1.3 Pulse Amplitude Distributions
The pulse amplitude distributions are visualised in Fig. 3, with the
underlyingfitteddatainTableD1.Themajorityofthesedistributions
arewellfitbyacombinationofpowerlaworlog-normaldistribution,
with the exceptions J1848+1516 and J0746+5514.

tectedpulsebrightnessbeingextremelyclosetothesensitivitylimits

plitudedistribution,resultsinaskeweddistributionwhichshouldnot
beconsideredtobeanaccuratemodeloftheunderlyingdistribution
(which should be visible with higher sensitivity instruments).
J0746+5514 appears to have a flat pulse amplitude distribution.
While this may be in part due to the first bin causing a positive
shift on the fitted function, the raw data for this source is extremely
erratic. The observed pulses are at an abnormally high significance,
with only 16 per cent of the 48 bursts below a SNR of 9 and morethan half of the observed pulses have a SNR above 13, making the
pulsesfromthissourceextremelybrightinthedata.Aspresentedin
Table 3, the standard deviation of the pulse width is more than 60
per cent of the mean pulse width (the observed pulses have widths
varying from 3–77 ms). The flat distribution is likely a consequence
oftherelativelylowsampleofpulsesfromsuchadiversepopulation,
andwillrequirefurtherfollow-uptoaccuratelycharacterisethepulse
amplitude distribution.
5.1.4 Spectral Indices
WhilespectralindicesofRRATshavebeenshowntobemoreextreme
than the normal pulsar population (Shapiro-Albert et al. 2018), it is
expected that the single-pulse spectral indices presented in Table 3
and Fig. 3 are biased towards being steeper than the actual emission
properties.Multipledifferentfactorscontributetothis,including(a)
thepositionuncertaintyonanumberofthesources(discussedin§2)
as the beam sensitivity is reduced for off-axis sources as the beam
narrows at higher frequencies, and (b) reduced SNRs after splitting
the bandwidth into 10 MHzsegment for low significance pulses in
order to better sample the spectral behaviour of the sources. (b)
will have a particularly strong effect on sources with more extreme
spectralindices(bothpositiveandnegative),asthegainofI–LOFAR
is relatively flat across the observed bandwidth, potentially causing
the dimmer emission to fall below the noise floor near the edges of
the bandwidth.
We can identify sources that have these biases when they have
beendetectedthroughbothsingle-pulseandperiodic,asafterfolding
the data to produce a folded archive there will likely be sufficient
data to have a strong SNR across the entire sampled bandwidth.
Consequently, the effects of (a) can be seen for the untimed source
J0317+1328 ( 𝛼sp=−5.3(8)and𝛼f=−1.8(4)), while (b) is likely
contributing to the spectral index disparity of J1538+2345 ( 𝛼sp=
−1.6(12)and𝛼f=−0.51(17)) and, despite the scattering causing
a strong positive bias in the single pulse data, J1848+1516 ( 𝛼sp=
−0.2(4)and𝛼f=0.52(14)).
J2108+4516, a binary pulsar, is a case where the spectral index is
significantlymorepositiveinthesingle-pulsedataasopposedtothe
periodic emission ( 𝛼sp=1.91(14)and𝛼f=−0.4(4)). This is likely
as a result of the source showing strong signs of scattering (in the
folded profile visible in Fig. C1(k)), with the resulting diminished
SNRs at lower frequencies causing the source to appear to have a
positive spectral index in the single-pulse data.
5.1.5 Further Limits on Detectability
SomesourcesinthePRAOcataloguemayhavenotbeendetecteddue
to limitations in the reported positions of sources. Due to the fixed
declination and wide full-width-half-max (FWHM) of their beams,
positionuncertaintymaybepresentintheirinitialreportedpositions
which can only be reduced with the detection of further pulses (to
reportabettermeanrightascension,andmoreaccuratedeclination).
This effect is noted specifically for PSR J1336+3414 (§5.2.6),
where the reported position and timed position differed by 0.48◦,
(between a third and a fifth of the beam FWHM depending on the
observing frequency). Correcting for the position of this source is
alsocorrelatedwiththedetectionofoff-pulseemissionthatleadsthe
mainpulsetrain,demonstratingeventhesesmallchangescanhavean
effect on detectability of pulses from these sources. Weaker sources
on the edge of detectability would be unlikely to be detected with
such a large offset between the true sky position and the observed
sky position.

5.1.6 Phase Space
ThetransientphasespaceplotinFig.5showsthatthepulsesdetected
as a part of this census have been brighter but have shorter spectral
duration than emission previous reported for RRATs.
In terms of luminosity, the baseline data for RRATs is generated
from entries in the RRATalog, which has been described in §2.3,
where sources are primarily described at either L-band or P-band
observations.Withtheexpectedbrighteningofthesesourcesatlower
frequencies, combined with the selection effects from the lower rel-
ativesensitivityofI–LOFARcomparedtootherinstrumentsattheir
respective frequencies, it is not a surprise that the results from this

ulation on this plot.
WhilethemultiplesurveyscitedasthedatasourcesfortheRRAT-
alog data provide the peak pulse brightness for each source, it is
unclear what form of sampling is used to determine the width val-
ues, with different works using a combination of median, mean and
brightest pulse sampling to provide the pulse width. For this work,
thewidthofthebrightestpulseforeachsourcewasusedtogenerate
the data for the plot.
Regardless, a clear separation is visible between the sources de-
tected as a part of this work and the general RRAT population. This
is likelydue to the selectioneffects previously mentionedthat result
in the telescope detecting strong, minimally scattered pulses with
similar widths to those presented in the RRATalog, resulting in an
order of magnitude increase in the luminosity, and order of mag-
nitude reduction in the frequency-duration samples from the lower
observing frequency.
5.1.7 Comparisons to Previous LOFAR Work
During the work of K15, 5 of the sources characterised as a part of
this work were detected using 20–22 stations of the LOFAR core,
whileourreprocessingoftheLOTAASsurvey(§4.2.1,M18,S19)in
Table 5 led to 12 detected single-pulse sources, with 2 overlapping
between the works.
Comparing the observed burst rates of these 15 detected sources,
there are two distinct categories of sources: those with similar ob-
served burst rates at both the 8-stations of the LOFAR core and
I–LOFAR, and those with significant increases in observed burst
rate as compared to this work.
The former group of 8 sources (J0054+6650, J0102+5356,
J0139+3336, J0746+5514, J1006+3015, J1336+3414, J1400+2125,
J2325−0530) can be considered a group of sources with the poten-
tial to be monitored with an international LOFAR station, with any
observing time offering a relatively high completeness as compared
to significantly more sensitive configurations of the LOFAR core.
Thesesourcesmayhaveadiscontinuityintheirpulseamplitudedis-
tributionsbetweentheemissionduringthemajorityofrotationsand
the observable giant-pulses detected during this work.
It is notable that out of the 7 sources that fall in the latter group
(J0201+7005, J0332+79, J1404+1159, J1538+2345, J1848+1510,
J2202+2134,J2215+4524),allbutonesource,J0332+79,werefound

5.2 Sources of Interest
5.2.1 PSR J0209+5759
J0209+5759isanullingpulsarreportedbytheCHIME/FRBcollab-

they typically can observe 21.4(5)pulses/h. They reported two es-
timates of the dispersion measure of the source, 55.282 pc cm−3,
though this was calculated through PRESTO’s prepfold rather
than through analysis of single pulses (but was used to gener-
ate the reported timing ephemeris), and 55.3(6)pc cm−3from the
CHIME/FRB system metadata.
At I–LOFAR, this source has been detected through both single-

tionof95.3(4)percentfora3-sigmadetectionthresholdofemission

The dispersion measure of the source at I–LOFAR was mea-
sured as 55.855(4)pc cm−3, within the confidence interval of the
CHIME/FRBmeasurement,butoffsetfromthe prepfold estimates.
At151 MHz, utilising their reported prepfold dispersion measure
measurement results in a distinct dispersive delay and appreciable
SNR loss when used on the brightest observed pulses and the active
mode periodic emission.

thatthenullingbehaviourwasdetectableduringthesurvey(usingthe

the relatively flat spectral index combined with the lower observing
frequencies of the LOTAAS survey (typically 119–151 MHz) caus-
ing pulses to be below the sensitivity limit of the instrument, or the
source may not have produced pulses bright enough to be detected
by either I–LOFAR or the 8-core stations used during the LOTAAS
survey (41 per cent of observations at I–LOFAR did not result in a
detection of J0209+5759).
5.2.2 PSR J0226+3356
WhileinitiallyannouncedasaRRATinearlyreleasesoftheCHIME

due to persistent periodic emission that has been detected with the
CHIME telescope.
Observations at I–LOFAR have yet to detect a burst from this
MNRAS 000, 1–19 (2023)RRATs with I–LOFAR 15
source, however periodic emission has been detected in all but one
observation taken to date.
5.2.3 PSR J1006+3015
J1006+3015 was reported by the PRAO catalogue, and was found
to have a period of 3.066 sand further timed as a part of this work.
While an uncertainty was not provided, this result is similar to the
multi-epoch period estimate of 3.069 spresented in Smirnova et al.
(2022).
While relatively infrequent as compared to J2325 −0530, this
sourcehasconsistentlyproducedextremelyhighsignificancepulses

otherwise Gaussian-shaped pulses (as visible in the best-pulse plot,
Fig. B1(l)) or multi-peaked pulses. Further follow-up with a more
sensitive instrument may help determine if these are unique traits to
these bright pulses, or an underlying variability that falls below the
noise floor for observations with I–LOFAR.
5.2.4 PSR J1132+2513
J1132+2513 is reported by the PRAO catalogue, and, as a source of
RRAT–likebursts,thoughwaspreviouslyonlyreportedasaperiodic
sourceduringtheGBT350DriftScanSurvey12(J1132+25)andasa
knownsourcebyLOTAAS(J1134+25).Duringthiswork,nosingle
pulses were detected, though the periodic emission reported during
the LOTAAS survey was detected.
This behaviour appears to align with the previous report from
Smirnova et al. (2022) which indicates the source is an intermittent
sourceofsingle-pulseemission,atalowsingle-to-noiseratio.Given
this pulsar currently does not have a full timing ephemeris in the
pulsarcatalogue(entryasJ1132+25),futureobservationsperformed
atI–LOFARwiththegoaloftimingthesourcethroughthedetectable
periodicemissionmayresultinthedetectionofsinglepulseemission
from the source.
5.2.5 PSR J1329+13
J1329+13 is a source from the PRAO catalogue with an extremely
low observed burst rate (Tyul’bashev et al. 2018), with the current
online version of the PRAO catalogue only reporting a single pulse
being detected from the source with the BSA LPI.
From 50 hofobservationswithI–LOFAR,only5pulseshavebeen
detected from the source. The first two pulses were observed within
the space of a week in February 2021, and it was not detected again
untiltwofurtherpulsesweredetectedinNovemberandearlyDecem-
ber 2021. Assuming there is no bias on the temporal distribution of
pulses (due to nulling, presence in binary system or intermittency),
this would give the source a burst rate of 0.10(5)h−1for an ILT
station, and 0.008(8)h−1at the BSA LPI.
If the time between pulses were to form a standard Poisson dis-
tribution, unless the source has a strongly positive spectral index
(which is unlikely given the properties of the few observed pulses),
12While reported on the survey webpage, the source is never discussed in
any publications regarding the survey, has an unknown discovery date and

I–LOFARmeasurement,ifnothigherduetotheincreasedsensitivity
oftheinstrument.Asaresult,itcanbeinferredthatthissourcelikely
acts similarly to an intermittent neutron star.
A blind periodicity search across the 5 observations with any
observed pulses using riptide (Morello et al. 2020b) did not result
in a credible detection of periodic emission from the source, with
7𝜎upper limits of between 1.6 mJyand1.0 mJyassuming a 1 per
cent duty cycle and that the source was active for the entirety of the
observations.
5.2.6 PSR J1336+3414
The reported timing ephemeris for BSA PSR J1336+3414 differs
significantly from the original parameters published in Tyul’bashev
etal.(2018)andsubsequentpapers.Pulsartimingindicatesitisoffset
by0.48 degfrom the reported position, and the rotation period was
found to be half of the originally reported 3.013 s.
The confusion in the reported source period may have been the
result of an infrequent off-pulse component visible in the pulsar
timing residuals. After updating the source pointing to match the
fit position from pulsar timing, 11 pulses (10 per cent) have been
observed to have a 0.044 phase (roughly 66 ms) offset from the
majorityofobservedpulses.Off-pulsecomponentscancauseissues
for most algorithms used to brute-force RRAT periods and may
have been biased to a harmonic rotation frequency, which was then
reported.
J1336+3414 has both the slowest spin down rate and the old-
est characteristic age of any RRAT, with 1.11(3)×10−16s s−1
and216 Myr, replacing J1647−3607 ( 1.29(2)×10−16s s−1) and
J1739−2521 ( 120 Myr). Its rotation parameters result in it sitting
extremely close to the standard radio pulsar deathline (Zhang et al.
2000, equation 4), making it an interesting source for modelling the
emission properties of ageing pulsars.

remainder align with the second. No pulses at I–LOFAR have been
detected offset from these two groups.
5.2.8 PSR J1848+1516
J1848+1516 is a source reported by several surveys. The RRATalog
cites the discovery to the GBNCC survey as J1849+15 (no publica-
tions discuss this, survey pages do not mention the source), it was
detectedasapartoftheLOTAASsurveyinM18,andbythePRAO

5.2.9 PSR J1931+4229
J1931+4229wasoneoftheearliestsourcedetectedbyCHIME/FRB
andannouncedintheCHIME/FRBGalacticSourcecatalogue.Itwas
initially observed to have a high burst rate at low frequencies, and
as a result a rotation period of 3.921 swas determined in December
2020 through the detection of 13 pulses within an observation. This
resultwasalsoconfirmedasaresultof9and11pulsesduringsingle
observations in April and June 2021.
This was the slowest source detected (and timed) as a part of this
census, and the resulting ephemeris indicates it falls into a region
period-periodderivativephasespace(seeFig.4)wheresourceshave
properties that border those of x-ray isolated neutron stars (XINS)
and magnetars. It is unknown whether these sources represent a
sub-set of neutron stars separate from the remainder of the RRAT
population,onlyassociatedbyemissionproperties,orarejustamore
extreme group of RRATs.
This source was also detected during an expanded search using
the BSA LPI. In Samodurov et al. (2022), the authors discuss it and
report that it has a rotation period of 3.6375 s. Our data has not
beenabletoreproducethisresult,andattemptingtoprocesstimesof
arrival at I–LOFAR using this result as a trial period does not result
in a coherent timing solution.
Thissourcewasnotdetectedduringre-processingoftheLOTAAS
archive, which was unexpected given the burst rate of 2.5(2)h−1at
I–LOFAR, which indicates it was likely to be detected within an
hour-long pointing, and the negative spectral index, of −1.06(7),
that would cause it to have a higher SNR when observed with the
8-core station in the LOTAAS survey’s configuration.
5.2.10 PSR J2215+4524

We are highlighting the source as while it was detected on a
regular basis at I–LOFAR prior to July 2021, with a burst rate of
0.49(16)h−1, since then it was only been detected 5 times at a rateof0.12(6)h−1. Prior to July 2021, the source was detectable at a
reasonable significance, with 8 of the 10 detected pulses having
SNRs above 8, and two being above 11. However, none of the 5
pulses observed since July 2021 have been above a SNR of 8.

5.3 The Potential for Further Novel Period Solutions
While 5 of the sources detected as a part of this work have lacked a
rotation period and do not meet the burst rate requirements for the
periodstobesolvedbystandardmethods,thereispotentialfortiming
modelstobederivedfromanextendedmonitoringcampaign.Thein-
development, sparse-sampled period solver altris(Morello 2023)
has been demonstrated to be capable of solving RRAT periods with
a limited set of TOA measurements taken from this work, and we
hopethatafterfurtherdetectionsitmaybepossibletosolverotation
periods for a number of these sources.
We highlight the near-term potential for Pushchino sources PSR

ber of occasions by I–LOFAR, despite their lack of known period.
While these sources have low burst rates compared to other sources
in this work (0.16(9), 0.37(10) and 0.292(97)h−1), they have been
detectedonaregularbasisduetoanumberofextendedobservations
over recent months. While these burst rates are low, with sufficient
observing time allocated there should be sufficient information for
thealtristool to solve the rotation models of these sources.
5.4 Viability of Single LOFAR stations for RRAT Monitoring
This work has shown that nearly a third of known Northern Hemi-
sphere RRATs can be detected with an international LOFAR station
working as a standalone instrument. Given the lack of follow-up
and systemic analysis of a large amount of these sources, ongoing
monitoring with the 14 international stations could allow for more
details of these elusive neutron stars to be unearthed, especially in
the case of sources with significantly low burst rates that can’t be
easily monitored.
The planned scheduling improvements being rolled out for LO-
FAR2.0willgiverisetotheLOFARMegaMode14.Thisautomated
scheduler allows for the international stations to be scheduled to be
controlled independent of the core and other station while the tele-
scope operates in ‘international mode’, and is expected to provide a
wealthofnewdataforpulsartimingandothermonitoringcampaigns.
This work shows that RRATs (and other similarly bright radio
transients) could be another pool of sources that can be sampled
for monitoring efforts with the new scheduler. Several sources have
beenshowntohavelow-burstrates(J0348+79,J2355+1523),orap-

5.5 Fast Radio Burst Search
Asmentionedin§3.4,eachobservationtakenasapartofthiscensus
was additionally searched for single-pulse candidates between 10–
500 pc cm−3to contribute to a directionally biased search for FRBs
asapartofthiscensus.However,nocrediblecandidates(apartfrom
theGalacticsourcesdiscussedin4.5)weredetectedasapartofthis
work.
A blind FRB search at 145 MHz has been performed using the
ARTEMISbackendattheRawlings(UK)andNançay(FR)LOFAR
stations(Karastergiouetal.2015),using 8×6 MHzbandwidthbeams
to increase the observed sky area from a normal HBA beam field of
view of 3.6 deg2to28.8 deg2for a similar amount of time to this
census ( 1446 h). From this, they determined an upper limit on the
fastradioburstrateof 29 sky−1d−1inthe 143–149 MHz range,and
a dispersion measure search for pulses at up to 300 pc cm−3.
Thisworkconsistedofasimilaramountofobservingtime,butthis
work has used a wider bandwidth, with an upper limit of 89 MHz
after RFI flagging, rather than the wider field of view used in the
work of Karastergiou et al.. Considering the overall volume of sky
probed,theskysampledasapartofthisworkwasprobedtoadepth
7.6 times greater than their work, however as a consequence of the
reduced field of view, we only reach an upper limit on the low–
frequencyfastradioburstratethatis92percent( ∼29 sky−1d−1)of
that presented by Karastergiou et al.. It should additionally be noted
that a fraction of time spent observing was near the Galactic plane,
which can be considered occulting due to the high sky temperatures
severely decreasing the telescope’s sensitivity (§3.3).
Itisworthhighlightingthatthe heimdall searchsoftwareusedfor
the census is optimised to detect broadband, spectrally flat sources,
whichdoesn’tdescribetheburststructuresofmanytypesoffastradio
transients. Such behaviour has been clearly documented for FRB
20180916B at the LOFAR core, see (Fig. 2 and Table 1 of Pleunis
et al. 2021). As a result, reprocessing the data across subsections of
thebandwidthisplannedforthefuture,andmayresultinpreviously

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We have shown that a reasonable number of Northern Hemisphere
RRATscanbebothdetectedandmonitoredwithasingleinternational
LOFARstation.Fromthe29detectedsources,4rotationperiodshave
been updated and 8 new phase-coherent pulsar timing ephemerides
have been presented. 15 sources had sufficient detected bursts that
their emission properties could be studied.
Observations are ongoing at I–LOFAR to continue the census for
newly announced sources and slowly observe the sources that were
not initially observed from the RRATalog (as described in §2.3),

APPENDIX A: OBSERVED SOURCES
Table A1 contains the name pairs for sources that were discussed in
thiswork,butdifferinnamefromtheiroriginalannouncementfrom
a catalogue mentioned in 2. This table prioritises timing solutions

sus that met the minimum 5 hobserving time criteria. The provided
list of observing time covers any observations that were performed,
searched and archived between August 2020 and October 2022.
Non-detected sources can be considered to have an upper bound
on their burst rate of at least 0.2(2)h−1at the sensitivity of a single
international LOFAR station at 151 MHz as a result of this work.
APPENDIX B: SINGLE-PULSE PROFILES

These figures contain both the raw-sampled data, and a box-car

Table A1 contains the best-fit parameters for each of the models
used to generate the fits to the data in Fig. 3. Only the powerlaw,
broken powerlaw and powerlaw–log–normal distribution fits have
been provided, as the remaining models were not optimal for any of
theobserveddata.Thebestmodel(aschosenbytheAICc)hasbeen
emboldened.
The functions are provided in Equations D1, D3, and D5, where
the fit parameters match those provided in the table, 𝑐𝑛refers to a

APPENDIX E: ADAPTED RRATALOG
An updated version of the RRATalog to contain sources announced
bysurveysthatwereapartofthe2016release,andadditionalsources
from the catalogues mentioned in §2, is distributed alongside the
machine–readable versions of the tables of this work (McKenna
2023d).
Severalofthecitedsurveywebpageshavegoneofflineinthetime
betweenthelastupdateoftheRRATalogin2016andthepublishing
of this work, preventing the catalogue from being fully rebuilt from
scratch. As a result, the updated version has been derived from the
last version, published in September 2016.
While distributed as both a text file and a webpage on the WVU
website, we opted to use the webpage for updating the catalogue as
it contains additional sources, and separated parameters into their
respective frequency bands.
The overall changes include, but are not limited to:
•Updating source names to match psrcatentries and recent
publications, fixing incorrect name labels
•Including data from the CHIME and Pushchino catalogues,
alongsideaddingnewcandidatesfrompreviouslyreferencedsurveys
•Fixing incorrect survey references
•Updatingentrieswherenewerdataisavailablethrough psrcat
or other surveys
•Updating derived property columns
This paper has been typeset from a T EX/LATEX file prepared by the author.
