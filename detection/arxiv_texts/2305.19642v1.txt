Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a well-known application of quantum information theory that
guarantees information-theoretically secure key exchange. As QKD becomes more and more commercially
viable, challenges such as scalability, network integration, and high production costs need to be addressed.
Photonic and electronic integrated circuits that can be produced in large volumes at low cost hold the key
to large-scale deployment of next-generation QKD systems. Here, we present a continuous-variable (CV)
QKD system using an integrated photonic-electronic receiver that combines a silicon photonic integrated
circuit implementing a phase-diverse receiver with custom-designed GaAs pHEMT transimpedance
amplifiers. The QKD system operates at a classical telecom symbol rate of 10 GBaud , generating high
secret key rates exceeding 0.7 Gb/s over a distance of 5 km and 0.3 Gb/s over a distance of 10 km . The secret
keys are secure against collective attacks with finite-size effects taken into account. Well-designed digital
signal processing enabled the high-speed operation. Our experiment sets a new record for secure quantum
communication and paves the way for the next generation of CV-QKD systems.
1. INTRODUCTION
Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method for sharing cryp-
tographic keys between remote users based on the laws of quan-
tum mechanics [ 1,2]. When combined with one-time pad en-
cryption, QKD offers information-theoretic secure data transmis-
sion that current or future technologies cannot break. However,
this requires a shared secret key that can only be used once, with
a length of at least as long as the message [ 3]. Therefore, in-
creasing the secret key rate (SKR) of QKD is crucial for enabling
secure communication in networks with a large number of users
or high data-rate applications, such as distributed storage en-
cryption and high-speed access networks [4, 5].
In the continuous variable (CV) flavour of QKD, quantum
information is encoded in the continuous degrees of freedom of
quantum systems, such as the amplitude and phase quadrature
of the electromagnetic field of light [ 6]. This protocol has gained
significant attention in the scientific community due to its ability
to provide high rates. It can approach the ultimate limit of secure
communication known as the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-
Banchi (PLOB) [ 7] bound. In the prepare-and-measure version
of the CV-QKD protocol, the sender, Alice, prepares coherentquantum states using a quadrature modulator and sends them to
the receiver, Bob. The quantum states propagate through an inse-
cure channel controlled by a potential eavesdropper (Eve). Bob
measures the quantum state using coherent detection, e.g., het-
erodyne or homodyne detection, facilitated by a local oscillator
(LO) [ 8,9]. These detection techniques have to be quantum-
noise-limited across the entire quantum signal bandwidth.
Numerous high-rate CV-QKD systems have been developed
recently, using both Gaussian [ 10–17] and discrete modulation
[18–22] of coherent states. While Gaussian modulation-based
protocols have the most advanced security proof [ 10], they also
require a high-resolution digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to
approximate the analog constellation space adequately. This is
problematic for increasing the symbol rate of the QKD system
since the signal-to-noise performance of DACs drops off at high
sampling rates [ 23]. On the other hand, discrete modulation uses
a discrete constellation space, making it much more compatible
with high-speed wireline components. However, thus far, there
are hardly any discrete-modulated (DM) CV-QKD systems oper-
ating in the multi-GBaud regime, which is due to the difficulty
in ensuring consistent and quantum-noise-limited behavior overarXiv:2305.19642v1  [quant-ph]  31 May 2023Research Article 2

such large bandwidths.
Although CV-QKD is well-suited for photonic integration
thanks to its compatibility with standard telecom components
[24], recent efforts have focused primarily on integrating dis-
crete variable (DV) QKD [ 25,26]. While Zhang et al. [27] have
been able to demonstrate the feasibility of using integrated cir-
cuits for CV-QKD, their achieved SKR of 0.25 Mb/s is relatively
low, especially compared to bulk fiber-based CV-QKD imple-
mentations [ 17–22]. In this work, we show that integrating
CV-QKD not only offers the potential for miniaturization and
cost-effectiveness but also provides higher key rates thanks to
high-bandwidth components and low-noise design techniques.
Therefore, integrating CV-QKD has the potential to significantly
enhance the cost-effectiveness, performance, and practicality of
QKD systems.
In this article, we report our efforts to overcome the band-
width limitations in CV-QKD. Specifically, we focus on improv-
ing the receiver’s performance by introducing a co-integrated
phase diverse receiver consisting of a silicon photonics optical
front-end and custom-integrated transimpedance amplifiers de-
signed in a 100 nm GaAs pHEMT technology. By utilizing high-
speed integrated components and implementing a low-noise
design, the receiver has access to a shot-noise-limited bandwidth
of more than 20 GHz.
At the transmitter’s side, we design a digital signal processing
(DSP) pipeline, including a pre-emphasis filter, for quantum state
preparation. This enhancement allows our transmitter to operate
at a symbol rate of 10 GBaud . By combining the improvements
in the receiver and transmitter, we demonstrate the highest secret
key rate (SKR) of any DM coherent state CV-QKD system to date.
Specifically, we achieve SKRs of 0.92 Gb/s and 0.48 Gb/s in the
asymptotic regime and 0.737 Gb/s and 0.315 Gb/s considering
finite-size effects over distances of 5 km and 10 km , respectively.
These advances represent a significant step towards realizing
practical, high-performance CV-QKD systems.
2. INTEGRATED RECEIVER
Our phase-diverse optical front-end, designed using imec’s
iSiPP50G silicon photonics platform [ 28], is shown schemati-
cally in Fig. 1. Light was coupled into the chip using two grating
couplers, with one input receiving the LO and the other receiv-
ing the incoming quantum signal. The quantum signal and
the LO were split into two arms using a 1x2 multimode inter-ferometer (MMI) to measure the conjugate quadratures. Two
waveguide heaters were added in the LO path and actively
controlled to ensure a 90◦phase shift between the measured
quadratures. This was followed by two balanced homodyne
detectors, which were composed of a Mach-Zehnder interferom-
eter (MZI) and two photodetectors with a high responsivity of
1.1 A/W [28]. The MZI was implemented using two 2x2 MMIs
and two heaters. The heaters were tuned using feedback from
the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) to minimize the amount of
direct current (DC) flowing into the TIA which increases the
common-mode rejection ratio. The overall measured efficiency
of the phase-diverse homodyne receiver was η=44%, with
most of the loss attributed to the grating coupler (insertion loss
(IL) = 2.5 dB [ 28]). However, this may be improved in future
designs by employing edge couplers (IL = 1.1 dB [ 29]) to achieve
a theoretical efficiency of η≈61%.
Each pair of balanced photodetectors was connected to a
separate TIA, designed in a 100nm GaAs pHEMT process. The
TIA implemented a three-stage core amplifier, enabling higher
transimpedance values and lowering the electronic noise [ 30]. A
micrograph of the PIC with the two TIA dies is shown in Fig. 2.
The overall size of the three chips was 4.8 mm x7.2 mm . The
chips were mounted on an interposer printed circuit board (PCB)
which was temperature stabilized by a thermo-electric cooler
and a surface-mounted thermistor. The output of each TIA was
connected to a 50Ωtransmission line, which was terminated in
a coaxial connector.
3. HIGH-RATE CV-QKD SYSTEM
Figure 3 shows the schematic of our high-speed CV-QKD sys-
tem, which consisted of two stations: the transmitter (Alice)
and the receiver (Bob), connected through a quantum channel
made of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The system was
designed to work semi-autonomously, meaning that it was able
to perform state preparation and measurement without user
intervention. This was achieved by a single system on a module
that monitored and controlled the different optical and electronic
sub-components. In the following subsection, we will provide a
detailed description of each station.
A. Transmitter (Alice)
Alice’s station comprised a high-speed, 8-bit arbitrary waveform
generator (AWG, Keysight M8195A) with two channels operat-Research Article 3

ing at a sampling rate of 32 GSample/s driving our developed
transmitter unit, known as qTReX [ 31], housing all optical and
electronic components. The inset in Fig. 3 shows the internal
schematic of qTReX. A 1550 nm continuous wave (CW) laser
with a linewidth of 100 Hz was used as an optical source. The
coherent states were generated in the sideband frequencies by
modulating the CW laser using an in-phase and quadrature (IQ)
modulator driven by the AWG. The IQ modulator was biased in
its minimum transmission point by controlling the DC voltages
using an automatic bias controller [ 32]. The modulation vari-
ance of the generated thermal state was controlled by a variable
optical attenuator (VOA). To avoid Trojan-horse attacks enabled
by back reflection, a Faraday isolator (FI) and wavelength filter
were connected to the output of the VOA.
Producing coherent states at a GBaud symbol rate requires a
transmitter with a large bandwidth. In practice, however, any
transmitter exhibits a high-frequency roll-off, introducing corre-
lations (intersymbol interference (ISI)) between the transmitted
symbols. From a security point of view, this can destroy the in-
dependent and identically distributed property of the quantum
symbols, which would violate an assumption commonly made
in security proofs [33].
To cope with this issue, we carefully designed a digital sig-
nal processing (DSP) pipeline, including a pre-emphasis filter
[34,35], for coherent state preparation, as depicted in Fig. 4.
The complex amplitude of the coherent state |α⟩=|x+jp⟩was
drawn from a probabilistically shaped discrete constellation with
a defined modulation order (M) and a Gaussian-like probability
distribution. This is also known as probabilistic constellation
shaping (PCS) in classical telecommunication [ 35]. These coher-
ent states were drawn at symbol rates of 8 GBaud or10 GBaud
and up-sampled to 32 GSample/s, after which they were pulse-shaped using a root-raised cosine filter with a roll-off of 0.2. To
compensate for the high-frequency slope of the transmitter, the
baseband signal was digitally pre-emphasized using the inverse
frequency response of the transmitter. The inset of Fig. 4 shows
the frequency response of the transmitter, including the IQ mod-
ulator, AWG and the RF cables, as well as the spectrum of the
quantum signal before and after the pre-emphasis filter. To share
a reference phase between the transmitter and the receiver, pi-
lot tones at 8 GHz or 7 GHz were frequency multiplexed with
the 10 GBaud or 8 GBaud pre-emphasized quantum signals,
respectively.
B. Receiver (Bob)
To measure the coherent quantum states, intradyne detection [ 9]
was performed using our integrated phase-diverse receiver and
a free-running CW laser with respect to the transmitter’s laser.
For intradyne detection, the frequency difference between these
lasers was set to be less than half of the bandwidth of the quan-
tum signal. To maximize the coupling into the chip, two polar-
ization controllers (PCs) were used to adjust the polarization
of the LO and the quantum signal. For autonomous system
calibration, i.e., for vacuum noise measurements (Signal off and
LO on) and electronic noise measurements (Signal off and LO
off), electronically-controlled switches were added in the LO
and signal path. After the phase-diverse receiver, the signal was
digitized using an 8-bit real-time oscilloscope (RTO, Keysight
DSA Z634A) with a sampling rate of 80 GSamples/s, which was
clock synchronized with the AWG using a 100 MHz reference
clock.
Figure 4 shows the DSP routine used for quantum symbols
recovery. First, a digital post-equalizer (whitening filter) was
applied to the quantum signal, the vacuum noise and the elec-Research Article 4

tronic noise traces to compensate for the high-frequency roll-off
of the receiver. The filter coefficients were obtained by fitting
the inverse frequency response of the receiver, computed from
the vacuum noise measurement. The equalized spectrum is de-
picted in the left inset of Fig. 4. Next, the pilot tone frequency
was estimated using a Hilbert transform on the filtered pilot tone
and the linear fit of its phase profile. To extract the relative phase
between the transmitter and the receiver, the pilot tone was base-
band transformed using the pilot frequency estimate. After that,
the quantum signal was baseband transformed by the frequency
difference between the known pilot frequency at the transmitter
and the pilot frequency estimate at the receiver. The phase of the
quantum signal was then corrected using the extracted phase of
the pilot tone. Afterwards, the temporal shift due to the prop-
agation delay of the quantum channel and different electronic
components was obtained by calculating the cross-correlation
between the reference transmitted samples and the received
samples. The corresponding quantum symbols were obtained
after root-raised-cosine matched filtering and downsampling.
Finally, the quantum symbols were rotated to compensate for a
residual phase shift due to the frequency difference between the
quantum signal and the pilot tone.
4. SECURITY ANALYSIS
Contrary to Gaussian CV-QKD protocols where coherent states
follow a two-dimensional zero-centered continuous Gaussian
distribution N(0,Σ), in discrete-modulated (DM) CV-QKD
protocols, coherent states are drawn from a discretized set
{αk}k=1,...M, with respective probabilities P(αk), where Mis
the cardinality of the discrete constellation. On the receiver side
the measurement of incoming quantum states yields a complex
number ζk. After transmitting and receiving a block of Nsym-
bols, the trusted parties hold two correlated strings (one for each
quadrature) of equal length, which they then correct for errors
and use to distill secret keys, i.e., identical random sequences
that are completely uncorrelated with any unauthorized party.
The security analysis of QKD protocols is based on the equiv-alent entanglement-based representation of state preparation.
In this representation, Alice generates an entangled state |Ψ⟩AB
and measures one of the modes to conditionally prepare the
other. Attribution of the channel to Eve, without loss of general-
ity, implies that after transmission Eve uses her share of the joint
pure state |Ψ⟩ABE to infer Bob’s measurement outcomes.
The security against collective attacks is defined as the posi-
tivity of accessible information difference [36]:
R∞=βIAB−χE, (1)
where βis the reconciliation efficiency that indicates the inability
to recover full mutual information IABbetween Alice’s and Bob’s
data sets, while χEis the Holevo bound that bounds the informa-
tion an adversary may hold on the generated data sequence at
the reference side (Bob). Both IABandχEcan be evaluated based
on the covariance matrix ΓABof the state shared after channel
ρAB. While Alice and Bob can directly obtain variances of local
quadrature operators, the term corresponding to the correlations
between modes AandBis not trivially assessed when a general
non-Gaussian measurement of the former prepares the state in
the latter. We employ a theory developed by A. Denys, P . Brown,
and A. Leverrier [ 37] that allows to analytically bound the corre-
lation term in ΓABand consequently the secure key rate (SKR)
in Eq. (1) in the asymptotic regime of infinitely many exchanged
quantum states.
We use three constellations for quadrature amplitude mod-
ulation (QAM) given by discretized Gaussian distributions:
M=16, 32, 64 (see top Fig. 5). Each constellation is charac-
terized by the variance of the distribution VMand assigned
probabilities within the constellation P(αk), determined by the
cardinality Mand the parameter νrelated to the variability or
statistical dispersion of the probability distribution. The optimal
value of modulation variance VM=2α2that maximizes the
SKR strongly depends on the post-processing efficiency β. We
choose the variance VM≈1as it allows us to operate at low
excess noise and it ensures that the mutual information IABof
the continuous-Gaussian protocol is a good approximation for
the DM protocol [ 38]. The choice of parameter νis crucial forResearch Article 5

the cardinality Mand modulation variance VM.
In the analysis, we presume that the receiver station is fully
trusted. Hence, the heterodyne detector efficiency η=44% and
electronic noise with variance Velwere modeled as linear cou-
pling of the signal to a thermal noise source purified by trusted
parties. This partially decouples Eve from Bob’s accumulated
key and decreases the Holevo bound χE[39].

rate of 0.92 Gb/s was achieved over the 5 km fiber channel due
to the high cardinality and the low excess noise compared to
16 QAM and 32 QAM. For the measurement set with M=32, a
higher measured excess noise led to a smaller SKR of 0.33 Gb/s ,
which is comparable to results for lower cardinality M=16set
(in the same fiber) with lower excess noise. Table 1 shows a
summary of the best experimental results for each constellation
and distance.
Furthermore, the lines of Fig. 5 (bottom) show the theoretical
predictions for protocols at VM=1SNU with M=16, 32,
and 64(with optimized ν), and GG02 protocol with Gaus-
sian modulation [ 6]. Theoretical predictions assume (from

ass×R∞. Using 64 constellation points allows to essentially
recover the performance of the protocol with “continuous” Gaus-
sian modulation.
Figure 6 illustrates the impact of fluctuations in channel pa-
rameters on system performance. Slight variations in channel
excess noise and untrusted loss result in noticeable differences in
the asymptotic key rate (represented as points). These variations
can arise due to a multitude of reasons, such as those caused
by polarization or temperature fluctuations, or mechanical drift
present in the optical probing of the photonic IC. Even with aResearch Article 6
small cardinality, the performance of GG02 (depicted by contour
lines) can be regained when operating under conditions of low
noise. This suggests that while reducing the channel excess noise
and approaching the performance of GG02 protocol through low
modulation variance, the system becomes more sensitive to un-
avoidable fluctuations in the channel parameters in practical
applications.
In the absence of rigorous finite-size key evaluation tech-
niques, we consider the significant impact of parameter estima-
tion on the key length in this regime. Channel parameters are
chosen with worst-case assumptions, ensuring that the infor-
mation accessible to Eve is not underestimated. We calculate
the pessimistic key rate Rfinite (Tlow,ϵup)(see Tab.1) within well-
established confidence intervals of the Gaussian channel param-
eters corresponding to parameter estimation failure probability

f ail=10−10with 6.5 standard deviations [ 40]. Additionally,
since error correction precedes the parameter estimation stage,
the whole raw key sequence can concurrently be used for pa-
rameter estimation and key extraction [41].
6. DISCUSSION
DM CV-QKD is a technique that employs a discrete constellation
of coherent states with finite cardinality. It is compatible with
high-speed telecom components, making it a promising candi-
date for achieving ultra-high secret key rates. In this work, we
have reported the fastest DM CV-QKD system that operates at a
symbol rate of 10 GBaud.
This record-breaking demonstration was made possible by
improving the total bandwidth of the system. In particular,
we designed an integrated photonic-electronic phase-diverse
receiver that maintains a wide shot-noise limited bandwidth.
Additionally, the transmitter bandwidth was improved through
well-designed DSP , which includes a pre-emphasis filter, for
quantum state preparation. These enhancements have enabled
our system to generate secret keys at exceeding 0.7 Gb/s in both
the asymptotic regime and after incorporating dominant effects
of the finite-size regime.
Compared to recent progress in high-rate DM CV-QKD [ 17,
19–22], our demonstration not only doubles the symbol rate
but also offers a compact and semi-autonomous QKD system.
However, there is room for improvement in the current system,
including rigorous finite-size effects estimation for non-Gaussian
channel assumption, and fast implementation of information
reconciliation. In addition, for enhanced system stability, the
next version of our receiver will necessitate proper chip pack-
aging. To this end, our results pave the way for ultra-high-rate
QKD systems, enabling secret key-demanding applications such
as real-time one-time-pad secured video encryption.
