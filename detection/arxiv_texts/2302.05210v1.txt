Abstract — The recent multi-modality models have achieved
great performance in many vision tasks because the extracted
features contain the multi-modality knowledge. However, most
of the current registration descriptors have only concentrated
on local geometric structures. This paper proposes a method
to boost point cloud registration accuracy by transferring
the multi-modality knowledge of pre-trained multi-modality
model to a new descriptor neural network. Different to the
previous multi-modality methods that requires both modalities,
the proposed method only requires point clouds during infer-
ence. Speciﬁcally, we propose an ensemble descriptor neural
network combining pre-trained sparse convolution branch and
a new point-based convolution branch. By ﬁne-tuning on a
single modality data, the proposed method achieves new state-
of-the-art results on 3DMatch and competitive accuracy on
3DLoMatch and KITTI. The code and the trained model will be
released at https://github.com/phdymz/DBENet.git .
I. I NTRODUCTION
Multi-modality data has been demonstrated inspiring
performance in numerous vision tasks. Typical examples
are the recent unsupervised general models, such as CLIP
[30], Flangmigo [ 1], which achieve accurate and high gen-
eralization performance in vision tasks. The multi-modality
model usually contains plentiful of knowledge from several
vision modalities. However, training such a general model
requires tremendous computational and storage resources. It
is usually difﬁcult for common researchers to train such a
model. Developing a multi-modality model becomes much
more challenging in the 3D computer vision as the 3D multi-
modality data acquisition is very expensive. In this paper, we
focus on a speciﬁc task by investigating how to use the multi-
modality information to solve the point cloud registration.
We are not going to train such a multi-modality model. We
propose a method to transfer the knowledge of an existing
multi-modality model to the point cloud registration task.
3D point cloud registration [ 17] aims at estimating a
transformation between two unaligned point clouds, which
is critical to many applications including robotics [ 27],
autonomous driving [ 24], and SLAM [ 41]. Current state-
of-the-art methods [ 15], [35] commonly start from deep

feature extraction and matching, followed by robust model
ﬁtting methods e.g. RANSAC [ 9] for robust transformation
estimation. Although a series of distinctive deep features
[7], [33], [11], [2] have been proposed recently, point cloud
registration in practical scenes remains challenging due to
reliance on geometric information and ignorance of semantic
information.
In the current research stream of point cloud registration,
plenty of deep descriptors [ 15], [35], [7], [4] only concen-
trate on local geometric structures. However, in practical
applications, there may exist many repeatable and ambiguous
structures in point clouds, such as ﬂoors, ceilings, and walls,
which tend to lead to wrong matches. A feasible solution is
to incorporate extra semantic information to make descriptors
more reliable. Recently, IMFNet [ 18] introduced an additional
image encoder and fused geometric information in point cloud
with semantic information in image using a cross-attention.
Since features generated from two different modalities have
complementary information, IMFNet successfully improved
the original pure point cloud descriptor by a large margin.
However, it’s not easy to take multi-modality data as input
since IMFNet requires both RGB and point cloud during
inference. Speciﬁcally, it’s tedious to deal with spatial and
temporal calibration and synchronization for different sensors.
Moreover, acquiring multi-modality data will inevitably
reduce the fault tolerance of the system, since the breakdown
of either sensor can lead to failure of registration.arXiv:2302.05210v1  [cs.RO]  10 Feb 2023To tackle above problem, an intuitive solution is to
transfer the knowledge learned from multiple modalities to
single modality. We ﬁnd that a point cloud branch in multi-
modality network trained on multi-modality data extracts
richer information than a single point cloud network trained
on pure point cloud data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
an approach for 3D point cloud registration, which transfers
the knowledge of existing pre-trained multi-modality model
to a new neural network that only needs point clouds during
inference. As shown in Figure 1, our method utilizes two
dual-branch networks. The network above is a existing pre-
trained network, which takes both point cloud and image as
input. The network below retains the pre-trained point cloud
branch, and replace the image branch with an extra point
cloud network. The reserved branch contains the knowledge
learned from multiple modalities and the other modules are
ﬁne-tuned using single modality data (point cloud). During
inference, the ﬁne-tuned network only takes point clouds as
input and achieves better performance by considering the
complementary information in two point cloud branches.
The main contributions of our work are:
We propose a framework transferring knowledge learned
from multi-modality pre-training, which improves the
performance of 3D point cloud registration while avoid-
ing complex calibration and synchronization of sensors
at inference time.
We provide analysis of the different strategies for
knowledge transfer between point cloud and image and
conduct experiments to verify it.
We propose a learnable dual-branches ensemble descrip-
tor for point cloud registration, which consists of two
mainstream feature extractors. The ablation shows that
it’s more powerful than a single feature extractor.
Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on
3DMatch [ 39] and shows competitive performances on
3DLoMatch [15] and Kitti [10].
II. R ELATED WORKS
A. Point cloud registration
The methods for point cloud registration can be roughly
divided into two categories: correspondence-free methods and
correspondence-based methods. The former mainly consists
of PointnetLK [ 3] and its variants [ 16], [36], [20]. They
usually extract two global features of given point clouds and
directly estimate the transformation without correspondences.
However, they face challenge on real-world low-overlap
point clouds. The latter usually follows a pipeline of feature
extraction, correspondence generation, and robust model
ﬁtting. Recently, beneﬁting from great progress in deep
learning, many learning-based methods were proposed. FCGF
[7] ﬁrst utilized sparse convolution [ 6] to extract deep
descriptors for point cloud registration, outperforming a series
of hand-craft descriptors at that time. D3Feat [ 4] ﬁrst provided
a network for extracting keypoints and descriptors simultane-
ously. Predator [5] introduced an overlap attention to estimate
overlap region, improving registration effectively. YOHO [ 35]designed an ensemble model to achieve SO(3)-equivariant
and proposed modiﬁed RANSAC with lower complexity.
Inspired by recent success in transformer [ 34], [8], [23],
many transformer-based methods [ 21], [29] were proposed,
taking long-dependency into consideration. However, most
works inevitably tend to generate wrong correspondences
facing repeatable and ambiguous structures due to reliance
on geometric information. In this work, we incorporate extra
information learned from multi-modality data to mitigate it.
B. Knowledge transfer between point cloud and image
Fusion of point cloud and image [ 18], [13], [22], which
contains complementary information, typically improves
performance. FFB6D [ 13] designed a bidirectional network
to effectively fuse features extracted from different modalities
and achieved great performances in 6D pose estimation.
IMFNet [ 18] successfully boosted registration by utilizing
a cross-attention to fuse geometric information from point
cloud and semantic information from image. However, all
above methods need spatial and temporal calibration and
synchronization for sensors, which limits their practical
applications. To reserve the improvement while obtaining
more ﬂexible inference, many works attempted to transfer
knowledge learned from multiple modalities to a single
modality. They are roughly divided into two technical routes:
network pre-training and knowledge distillation. The former
commonly incorporates a network pre-trained on different
modalities and utilizes knowledge in pre-trained weights
during inference. For example, many monocular 3D detection
methods [ 25], [32] leveraged depth estimation to obtain
a pre-trained network and utilized it to produce pseudo-
lidar to improve monocular detection. The latter achieves
improvement by setting a network trained by multi-modality
data as a teacher [ 5], [42]. For instance, S2M2-SSD [ 5]
trained a single-modality network to learn from a multi-
modality network to obtain comparable performance but took
only single-modality input at inference. In this paper, we
choose the former route to boost registration. We also tried
using knowledge distillation but failed, more details about
our attempt are illustrated in experiments.
III. M ETHOD
Figure 2 shows the pipeline of our framework. Our
framework consists of two models, IMFNet [ 18] and DBENet.
IMFNet is an existing model pre-trained on multiple modali-
ties, which contains knowledge we want to transfer. DBENet
is our proposed Dual-Branch Ensemble network, which
receives the transferred knowledge. During ﬁne-tuning, we
begin with transferring the pre-trained weights of SFCN
in IMFNet to the SFCN in DBENet. Then we utilize pure
point clouds to ﬁne-tune the KPFCN and attention module in
DBENet. At inference, our DBENet only takes point clouds as
input and can achieve high performance beneﬁting from both
transferred knowledge and ensemble design. The details of
each component are introduced in the following subsections.Attention

𝐹𝐷𝐵𝐸Fig. 2. The overall architecture of our proposed framework. Our framework contains two dual-branch networks, IMFNet and DBENet. IMFNet is an
exiting model pre-trained on multiple modalities. DBENet integrates two heterogeneous branches but only takes point clouds as input. During ﬁne-tuning,
we begin with transferring the weights of SFCN in IMFNet to SFCN in DBENet. Through such weights transfer, the knowledge learned from multiple
modalities can be transferred to DBENet, and then we freeze the SFCN in DBENet and ﬁne-tune DBENet using pure point clouds. Beneﬁting from
knowledge transfer and ensemble design for DBENet, our ﬁne-tuned DBENet can achieve comparable or even better performance to IMFNet but with only
single modality input at inference. FIMFandFDBEboth represent the feature matrix for point cloud registration.
A. IMFNet
Since IMFNet [ 18] has a dual-branch architecture, which
separates the networks for two different modalities, we choose
it as our pre-trained network. The architecture of IMFNet is
shown in Figure 2, which consist of 3 components: encoder,
cross-attention and decoder.
The encoder contains two branches, which encodes features
from point cloud and image, respectively. The branch for
point cloud i.e. sparse fully convolution network (SFCN) is
implemented by sparse convolution [ 6] and has the same
architecture as the encoder in FCGF [7].
For an input point cloud P2RN3, it gradually abstracts
it and extracts high-level features FP2RN0256, where
N0denotes the number of abstracted points. The branch
for image is a ResNet34 [ 12]. It takes the corresponding
imageI2RHW3as input and outputs the ﬂatten features
FI2RM0128, whereM0=H=8W=8denotes the number
of subsampled pixels. After obtaining features from two
different modalities, IMFNet use a scale dot-product attention

the fused features are gradually upsampled in U-net [ 31]
manner to output point-wise features FIMFfor registration.
B. DBENet
Our DBENet also contains two different branches, but two
branches take the same point clouds as input. DBENet is
more powerful than a single SFCN because it intergrates a
new branch based on kernel point convolution. As mentioned
in [40], voxel-based methods e.g. sparse convolution has
advantage of extracting coarse-grain features, while point-
based methods such as PointNet++ [ 28], KPConv [ 33] has
advantage of capturing ﬁne-grain features. Therefore, we
preserve the dual-branch architecture in IMFNet and replace
the branch for image with a KPFCN encoder for point cloud
to further improve the features extracted by sparse convolution
network.
The details of KPFCN in DBENet are also shown in
Figure 2. It consists of many KPConv-based blocks. Given a
input point cloud P2RN3with features Fin2RN1=
[1;1:::1]T, KPFCN gradually encodes spatial informationinto features and downsamples the point cloud. The ﬁnal
outputs of KPFCN are high-level features Fkp
P2RN0128,
which have the similar dimension with ﬂatten image features
FI2RM0128. We also use the same cross-attention module
to fuse the features Fkp
P2RN0128extracted by KPFCN
with the features FP2RN0256extracted by the SFCN.
After that, a decoder gradually upsamples the fuesd features
FDBE
fused2RN0256and normalizes the features FDBE2
RN32in the last layer as outputs for registration. We can
useFDBE2RN32to generate putative correspondences
and then use a robust estimator such as RANSAC [ 9] to
achieve registration during inference.
C. Fine-tuning
As mentioned above, point cloud contains rich geomet-
ric information and image texture contains rich semantic
information, making feature extractor pre-trained on multiple
modalities more distinctive. Therefore, we ﬁrst transfer the
knowledge contained in pre-trained model to our DBENet.
Since our DBENet has a same SFCN with IMFNet and
SFCN in IMFNet contains knowledge learned from multiple
modalities, we can achieve knowledge transfer by directly
transferring the network weights. Speciﬁcally, we replace
the randomly initialized weights in DBENet with the pre-
trained weights of SFCN in IMFNet and then freeze the
transferred weights and ﬁne-tune the weights of KPFCN and
cross-attention module.
We utilize the hardest contrastive loss [ 7] to ﬁne-tune our
DBENet. Given a point cloud pair, we ﬁrst sample some points
to generate putative correspondences by feature matching and
build the positive pair set Pand the negative pair set N.
The positive pair set Pcontains feature pairs of the putative
correspondences with limited residual error under the ground
truth transformation, while the negative pair set Nmines the
hardest negatives ^FDBE

IV. E XPERIMENT
We evaluate our method by comparing it with many state-
of-the-art methods on widely-used public datasets including3DMatch [ 39], 3DLoMatch [ 15], and KITTI [ 10]. The
following sections are organized as follows. First, we illustrate
our experimental settings including implementation details
and evaluation metrics in section IV-A. Next, we conduct
experiments on indoor datasets, 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch in
section IV-B and IV-C. We also implement an experiment on
outdoor dataset KITTI in section IV-D. To further understand
our method, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies in
section IV-E.
A. Experimental settings
Implementation: We implement our networks in Pytorch
[26]. For IMFNet [ 18], we directly use the pre-trained weights
provided in https://github.com/XiaoshuiHuang/
IMFNet . We use the ADAM optimizer [ 19] with an initial
learning rate of 0.1 to ﬁne-tune our DBENet for 10 epochs and
the batch size for ﬁne-tuning is set to 2. All the experiments
are conducted on a single GTX 1080ti graphic card with Intel
Core i7-7800X CPU.
Evaluation metrics: To quantitatively compare our method
with other state-of-the-art methods, we select several widely-
used evaluation metrics to evaluate performance.
For 3DMatch [ 39] and 3DLoMatch [ 15] benchmark, the
most widely-used evaluation metrics are: Feature-Match
Recall (FMR), Inlier-Ratio (IR), and Registration Recall
(RR). FMR measures the percentage of pairs that have >5%
inlier correspondences with 10cm residual under the ground
truth transformations. IR describes the percentage of inlier
correspondences among all the putative correspondences
generated by feature matching. And RR directly shows the
percentage of successfully registered pairs. In these two
benchmarks, we consider the registration with ERMSE<
0:2mas a successfully registered pair. ERMSE denotes the
error metric between an unaligned point cloud pair fi;jg:

For KITTI [12] benchmark, the most widely-used evalua-
tion metrics are: Relative Translation Error (RTE), Relative
Rotation Error (RRE) and Success rate (Success). RTE is
deﬁned as RTE =^t t, where ^tdenotes the estimated

, where ^R

B. Experiment on 3DMatch
3DMatch [39] is a well-known dataset, which consists of
62 scenes. Here we follow the ofﬁcial split [ 15] to divide the
dataset into 46 scenes for training, 8 scenes for validation andTABLE I

8 scenes for test. We compare our methods with many state-
of-the-art methods. Besides IMFNet [ 18], all the competitors
are trained and tested on point clouds and without reﬁnement
during test, while IMFNet is trained and tested using two
different modalities.
The results of our method and competitors are shown
in Table I. Our method surprisingly achieves new state-of-
the-art on all evaluation metrics, and even outperforms the
method using multiple modalities. Moreover, our method
successfully boosts the performance of baseline i.e. FCGF
[7] by a large margin. More analysis on improvement is
illustrated in ablation studies.
C. Experiment on 3DLoMatch
3DLoMatch [ 15] is a much more challenging benchmark,
which consists of low-overlap ratio (10%-30%) point cloud
pairs from 3DMatch. All the competitors tested on 3DLo-
Match are previously trained on 3DMatch.
The results on 3DLoMatch are shown in Table II. It’s
observed that our method only achieves state-of-the-art on
IR metric. This is because the state-of-the-art methods such
as GeoTransformer [ 29] are trained using overlap-aware loss,
which provides extra supervision for network to learn to
estimate overlap regions. Although these overlap-based meth-
ods have a natural advantage when facing low-overlap point
cloud pairs, our method still shows a competitive performance
even outperforms Predator [ 15], which contains an overlap
attention. Among methods without overlap supervision such
as YOHO [ 35] and SpinNet [ 2], our method is a cost-effective
choice due to its simpler implementation and comparable
performance. Moreover, our method achieves comparable
performance with IMFNet [ 18], but our method only takes
point clouds as input during inference, avoiding the challenge
of calibration and synchronization for sensors. As on 3DMatch
benchmark, our method also boosts baseline i.e. FCGF by a
large margin, indicating the effectiveness of our method.
D. Experiment on KITTI
KITTI [ 10] is one of the most well-known datasets for
autonomous driving, which contains 3D point clouds captured
by LiDAR. We follow previous settings in [ 18] and divide
11 sequences (0-10) of the odometry dataset into training set
(0-5), validation set (6-7) and test set (8-10). Referring toTABLE II

the experimental settings in [ 18], we report both the averages
and standard deviations for RTE and RRE.
The results are shown in Table III. Although our method
does not achieve the best performance, it still achieves
comparable performance to the method trained on multiple
modalities. Moreover, our method also boosts the performance
of FCGF [ 7], which serves as a baseline in our experiments.
This also reﬂects the effectiveness of our method.
E. Ablation studies
To further understand our work, we conduct several ablation
studies. First, we conduct an experiment to illustrate the
effectiveness of multi-modality pre-training and our ensemble
design. Second, we empirically demonstrate our decision
to use the aforementioned ﬁne-tuning strategy. Finally, we
brieﬂy discuss another knowledge transfer method, knowledge
distillation and illustrate our attempt. All the ablation studies
are conducted on 3DMatch dataset.
Effectiveness of multi-modality pre-training and model
ensemble. As mentioned in previous paragraph, multi-
modality data is more informative, which helps network to
learn a more distinctive descriptor. We verify it by replacing
the weights in an original FCGF [ 7] with that in IMFNet
[18]. The comparison is shown in line 2 and 3 in Table IV.
Here we use P to denote using the weights trained on pure
point cloud, and use P+I to denote using the weights coming
from pre-trained IMFNet. It’s observed that the performance
of FCGF using multi-modality pre-trained weights performs
better, which veriﬁes our proposal.
As illustrated in [ 40], voxel-based feature and point-
based feature are commonly complementary. The former has
advantages in learning structure, while the later has advantages
in capturing details. Therefore, the ensemble model which
has heterogeneous branches tends to perform better. Line 2TABLE IV

and 4 in Table IV also verify it. We compare the baseline
i.e. FCGF with a DBENet trained without using transferred
weight. The DBENet trained from scratch also improves
the performance of the baseline, indicating the effectiveness
of our ensemble design. All in all, both the multi-modality
pre-training and model ensemble help our method achieve
outstanding performance on point cloud registration.
Ablation on ﬁne-tuning strategies. Pre-training and then
ﬁne-tuning is a widely-used paradigm. Generally speaking,
freezing encoder and ﬁne-tuning other modules is the most
conventional choice. We also attempt to freeze other pre-
trained modules and ﬁnd that freezing encoder and decoder
and then ﬁne-tuning attention and KPFCN is the best choice
as shown in Table V.
Discussion on knowledge transfer. As mentioned in
related works, there exists the other methods to transfer
knowledge learned from multiple modalities to a single
modality. Therefore, we designed a knowledge distillation
strategy to achieve it.
Since point cloud is not as regular as image, the number of
input points is uncertain and the extracted high-level features
are unordered, making the features extracted by KPFCN
impossible to approximate the features extracted by ResNet34
by a direct supervision. Therefore, we designed a point-to-
point teacher-student loss in the output of the cross-attention
module to avoid pixel-to-point direct distillation.
We hope the teacher i.e. pre-trained IMFNet to guides
the student i.e. DBENet, so that the fused features FDBE
fused
extracted by student can simulate the fused features FIMF
fused
extracted by teacher. To make fused features as consistent as
possible, we add a point-to-point KL loss during ﬁne-tuning:

using pre-trained weights, KD denotes using an extra point-
to-point teacher-student loss during ﬁne-tuning. Although it
sounds reasonable to add a loss to make the student features
simulate the teacher’s as much as possible to improve student,
it fails in practical experiment and even has a negative impact.
We infer that the large gap between two completely different
modalities and network architectures makes it fail to distillate
knowledge explicitly.
We also attempted replacing KL loss with L1 loss, but
get similar results. It can be seen that for heterogeneous
cross-modality networks, pre-training may be a better way of
knowledge transfer than distillation. Uniﬁed networks between
different modalities such as transformer may [ 34], [30] have
the potential for knowledge transfer in terms of knowledge
distillation because it may be able to narrow the gap caused
by the difference in network architectures.
V. C ONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a method to transfer the multi-
modality knowledge to boost the performance of point
cloud registration. Our proposed method ensembles the pre-
trained sparse convolution branch and point convolution
branch, which can leverage the multi-modality knowledge and
utilize only the point cloud modality during inference. The
proposed method does not require the strict calibration and
synchronization of multiple modalities during the inference.
The experiments show that the ensemble model with multi-
modality knowledge can signiﬁcantly improve the registration
accuracy and even outperform the multi-modality model.ACKNOWLEDGMENT
