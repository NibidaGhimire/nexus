Abstract
This paper provides new observations on the Lov´ asz θ-function of graphs. These include a simple
closed-form expression of that function for all strongly re gular graphs, together with upper and lower
bounds on that function for all regular graphs. These bounds are expressed in terms of the second-largest
and smallest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the regu lar graph, together with sufﬁcient conditions
for equalities (the upper bound is due to Lov´ asz, followed b y a new sufﬁcient condition for its tightness).
These results are shown to be useful in many ways, leading to t he determination of the exact value of
the Shannon capacity of various graphs, eigenvalue inequal ities, and bounds on the clique and chromatic
numbers of graphs. Since the Lov´ asz θ-function factorizes for the strong product of graphs, the r esults
are also particularly useful for parameters of strong produ cts or strong powers of graphs. Bounds on the
smallest and second-largest eigenvalues of strong product s of regular graphs are consequently derived,
expressed as functions of the Lov´ asz θ-function (or the smallest eigenvalue) of each factor. The r esulting
lower bound on the second-largest eigenvalue of a k-fold strong power of a regular graph is compared to
the Alon–Boppana bound; under a certain condition, the new b ound is superior in its exponential growth
rate (ink). Lower bounds on the chromatic number of strong products of graphs are expressed in terms
of the order and the Lov´ asz θ-function of each factor. The utility of these bounds is exem pliﬁed, leading
in some cases to an exact determination of the chromatic numb ers of strong products or strong powers
of graphs. The present research paper is aimed to have tutori al value as well.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The notion of the graph capacity in Shannon’s problem of zero -error communication [ 86]
had a signiﬁcant impact on the development of information th eory and graph theory, including
the introduction of perfect graphs by C. Berge [ 11], strong graph products (or powers) ([ 7],
[84]), the introduction of the Lov´ asz θ-function of a graph as a computable upper bound on its
Shannon capacity ([ 57], [65]), the rank-bound by Haemers [ 43], and other important follow-up
works that are surveyed, e.g., in [ 7], [9], [52], [58].
In graph theory, there are four central sorts of graph produc ts, each with its own applications
and theoretical interpretations. The reader is referred to the excellent handbook [ 46], which
presents the rich and fertile ﬁeld of graph products. Strong product of graphs is one of the most
extensively studied sorts of graph products, and there exis ts a polynomial-time algorithm that

at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 3200 003, Israel (e-mail: eeigal@technion.ac.il).2
ﬁnds the unique prime factorization of any connected graph w ith that type of multiplication
[31]. Strong powers of graphs are also fundamental in informati on theory. Their information-
theoretic signiﬁcance stems from the notion of the Shannon c apacity of graphs for error-free
communication [ 86], and the Witsenhausen rate [ 94] in the zero-error source coding problem
with perfect side information at the receiver. Properties o f strong products and strong powers of
graphs, and bounds on their independence numbers and chroma tic numbers have been extensively
studied, e.g., in [ 4], [7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [29], [30], [31], [36], [38],
[39], [43], [45], [46], [47], [51], [52], [54], [55], [56], [64], [65], [70], [84], [86], [87], [90],
[91], [94], [95].
The present work continues the above paths of research. It pr ovides some new observations on
the Lov´ asz θ-function of regular graphs, calculation of the Shannon cap acity of some strongly
regular graphs, bounds on eigenvalues of graphs (in particu lar, the second-largest and smallest
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix, which play a key role in spectral graph theory), bounds
related to Ramanujan graphs, and strong products of graphs. The analysis in the present work
mainly relies on the notion of the Lov´ asz θ-function of graphs [ 65]. The paper includes a thorough
review of the backgrounds relevant to this work with suitabl e references or explanations, which
also serve to motivate the presentation of the results in thi s work and to put them into perspective.
The presentation in this research paper is consequently aim ed to have tutorial value as well.
The results obtained in this work are outlined as follows:
(1) A known upper bound on the Lov´ asz θ-function of a regular graph is expressed in terms
of the smallest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix [ 65]. A key result in this work provides
a lower bound on the Lov´ asz θ-function of a regular graph, which is expressed in terms of
the second-largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. New sufﬁcient conditions for attaining
these bounds are speciﬁed (Proposition 1).
(2) A simple and closed-form expression of the Lov´ asz θ-function is derived for all strongly
regular graphs (Corollary 1).
(3) Eigenvalue inequalities are derived, which relate the s mallest and second-largest eigenvalues
of a regular graph. They hold with equality if and only if the g raph is strongly regular
(Corollaries 2and3).
(4) The Shannon capacity of several strongly regular graphs is determined (Section III-E ).
(5) Bounds on parameters of regular graphs, and in particula r of Ramanujan graphs, are derived
(Corollaries 4–6).
(6) Bounds on the smallest and the second-largest eigenvalu es of strong products of regular
graphs are derived, which are expressed in terms of calculab le parameters of its factors
(Proposition 2).
(7) A new lower bound on the second-largest eigenvalue of a k-fold strong power of a regular
graph is compared to the Alon–Boppana bound. Under a certain condition, the former bound
shows an improvement in its exponential growth rate as a func tion ofk(Section III-C ).
(8) Every non-complete and non-empty connected regular gra ph, whose Lov´ asz θ-function is
below a certain value, is proved to have the property that alm ost all its strong powers are
highly non-Ramanujan (Proposition 3).3
(9) Lower bounds on the chromatic number of strong products o f graphs are expressed in terms
of the order and Lov´ asz θ-function of each factor (Proposition 4). Their utility is exempliﬁed,
while also leading to exact chromatic numbers in some cases.
The paper is structured as follows: Section IIprovides notation and a thorough review of
the backgrounds relevant to this work. Section IIIprovides the results of this work, followed
by examples and discussions. It is composed of ﬁve subsectio ns that address issues related to
the Lov´ asz θ-function, Shannon capacity of graphs, Ramanujan graphs, t he second-largest and
smallest eigenvalues of strong products or strong powers of graphs, and the chromatic numbers
of such graphs. Section IVproves the results in Section III.
II. P RELIMINARIES
This section provides essential notation and preliminarie s for this paper. The following standard
notation in set theory is used: N={1,2,...}is the set of natural numbers, Ris the set of real
numbers, and [n]/defines{1,...,n}withn∈N. The cardinality of a set Ais a measure of its number
of elements; it is denoted by |A|, and (by deﬁnition) it is equal to its number of elements if A
is a ﬁnite set.
LetGbe a graph, and let V(G)andE(G)denote, respectively, the sets of vertices and edges
inG. The order andsize of a graph Gare deﬁned to be |V(G)|and|E(G)|, respectively. A
graphGis said to be ﬁnite ifV(G)is a ﬁnite set. A pair of vertices are adjacent in a graph G
if these two vertices are the endpoints of an edge e∈E(G).
A graph is called simple if it has no loops (i.e., it has no edge with identical endpoin ts), and
if there are no multiple edges between any pair of adjacent ve rtices. A graph Gis said to be
undirected if its edges have no directions; otherwise, it is a directed g raph, a.k.a. a digraph .
Throughout this paper, it is assumed that the graphs under co nsideration are ﬁnite, undirected,
and simple.
Anempty graph is an edgeless graph. A graph Gis said to be an r-partite graph if its vertex
setV(G)is a disjoint union of rsubsets such that every pair of vertices that are elements of an
identical subset are non-adjacent. If r= 2, then it is a bipartite graph .
Awalk in a graph Gis a sequence of its vertices such that (by deﬁnition) every p air of
consecutive vertices are adjacent. A path in a graph is a walk with no repeated vertices (in
other words, a path is a walk along the vertices of Gsuch that no vertex can be visited twice).
The length of a path is deﬁned as its number of edges. Hence, P= [v1,...,vℓ]is a path in a
graphGif{vi,vi+1} ∈E(G)for alli∈[ℓ−1], and all the vertices in the sequence {vi}ℓ
i=1are
distinct; the endpoints of the path Parev1andvℓ, and its length is equal to ℓ−1. AcycleC
in a graph Gis obtained by adding an edge to a path Psuch that it gives a closed walk (i.e.,
a walk whose endpoints are identical). The cycle C= [v1,...,vℓ,v1]is of length ℓ, which is
obtained by adding the edge e={vℓ,v1} ∈E(G)to the above (ℓ−1)–length path P; the two
identical endpoints of the cycle Care the vertex v1.
A graph is said to be connected if every two distinct vertices in that graph are connected by a
path (otherwise, it is a disconnected graph ). The distance between a pair of distinct and connected
vertices in a graph is deﬁned to be the length of the shortest p ath whose two endpoints are the
given pair of vertices. The distance between two disconnect ed vertices in a graph is deﬁned to4
be inﬁnite, and the distance between a vertex and itself is se t to be zero. The diameter of a
graph is the maximum distance between any pair of vertices in that graph. A connected and
ﬁnite graph has a ﬁnite diameter, and the diameter of a discon nected graph is (by deﬁnition)
inﬁnite.
The following standard notation in graph theory is used:
(a)Kndenotes the complete graph onn∈Nvertices, where every pair of distinct vertices are
adjacent; hence, K1is an empty graph with a single vertex.
(b)Kn,mdenotes the complete bipartite graph , which is a bipartite graph consisting of a vertex
set that is a disjoint union of two ﬁnite sets V1andV2of cardinalities nandm, respectively,
and a set of edges that are all the possible connections of a ve rtex inV1and a vertex in V2.
(c)Pndenotes an (n−1)–length path withn∈N, which is a graph on nvertices that forms
a path of length n−1; in particular, P1=K1.
(d)Cndenotes an n-length cycle , which is a graph on n≥3vertices that forms a cycle of
lengthn.
(e)K(m,r)denotes the Kneser graph with integers 1≤r≤m. It hasn=/parenleftbigm
r/parenrightbig
vertices,
represented by all r-subsets of [m]. Two vertices are adjacent in that graph if they are
represented by disjoint r-subsets. The graph K(m,r), provided that it has more than one
vertex, is a connected graph if and only if either m >2ror(m,r) = (2,1).
Asubgraph is a graph that exists within another graph. More formally, Fis a subgraph of
a graphGifV(F)⊆V(G)andE(F)⊆E(G). IfFis a subgraph of G, we write F⊆G. A
spanning subgraph is obtained by edge deletions from the original graph, while its vertex set is
left unchanged. An induced subgraph is obtained by removing vertices from the original graph,
followed by the deletion of the edges that are adjacent to the se removed vertices.
Aclique in a graph Gis a subset of pairwise adjacent vertices in G(in other words, the
induced subgraph of Gon that subset is a complete subgraph). The maximum size of a c lique
inGis called the clique number ofG, and it is denoted by ω(G). Similarly, an independent set
(a.k.a. coclique ) inGis a subset of pairwise non-adjacent vertices. The maximum s ize of an
independent set is called the independence number ofG, and it is denoted by α(G). Aproper
vertex coloring ofGis a coloring of its vertices such that no pair of adjacent ver tices are assigned
the same color. The smallest required number of colors for a p roper coloring of the vertices in
Gis called the chromatic number ofG, and it is denoted by χ(G).
LetG= (V(G),E(G))be a ﬁnite, undirected, and simple graph of order |V(G)|=n. Deﬁne
theadjacency matrix A=A(G)of the graph Gto be ann-times-nsymmetric matrix such that
A= (ai,j)1≤i,j≤nwithai,j= 1 if{i,j} ∈E(G), andai,j= 0 otherwise (hence, the diagonal
elements of Aare in particular zeros). Let the eigenvalues of A(a.k.a. the eigenvalues of G)
be given in decreasing order by
λmax(G) =λ1(G)≥λ2(G)≥...≥λn(G) =λmin(G). (1)
The spectrum ofGconsists of the eigenvalues of A, including their multiplicities. The terms
λ1(G),λ2(G), andλn(G)are referred to as the largest, second-largest, and smallest eigenvalues
of the graph G, respectively. The second-largest and smallest eigenvalu es play a key role in
spectral graph theory , and the interested reader is referred to, e.g., [ 18], [25], [26], [88], [89].5
The number of edges that are incident to a vertex in a graph is c alled the degree of the vertex,
and a graph is said to be regular if its vertices have an identical degree. A regular graph who se
all vertices have a ﬁxed degree dis called a d-regular graph, and it is said to have valencyd. A
d-regular graph has a largest eigenvalue λ1(G) =d, with the all-ones column vector (of length
n) as an eigenvector.
LetGbe a ﬁnite, simple and undirected graph. The complement ofG, denoted by G, is deﬁned
to have the same vertex set as G, and (by deﬁnition) any pair of distinct vertices in V(G)are
adjacent in Gif and only if they are non-adjacent in the graph G. Hence, we have the equalities
|E(G)|+|E(G)|=1
2n(n−1), andV(G) =V(G). Furthermore, let JnandIndenote the
n-times-nall-ones and identity matrices, respectively. Then, by deﬁ nition, it follows that the
adjacency matrices of the graph Gand its complement Gare related by the equality
A(G) =Jn−In−A(G). (2)
LetGbe ad-regular graph on nvertices, and let Gbe the complement graph. Then, by ( 2),
the spectra of GandGare related as follows [ 18, Section 1.3.2]:
λ1(G) =n−d−1 =n−1−λ1(G), (3)
λℓ(G) =−1−λn+2−ℓ(G), ℓ= 2,...,n. (4)
Speciﬁcally, setting ℓ=nin (4) gives
λmin(G) =−1−λ2(G). (5)
A graph is called acyclic if it has no cycles, and a connected acyclic graph is called a tree.
A tree on nvertices has n−1edges, and for every pair of distinct vertices in a tree, ther e is a
unique path joining them (see, e.g., [ 25, Theorem 5.1.2]). A leafin a tree is a vertex of degree 1,
and every tree contains at least two leaves (a tree is therefo re not a regular graph, unless it is
the complete graph on two vertices K2). A disjoint union of trees is a forest (i.e., a forest is an
acyclic graph whose connected components are trees). In par ticular, a deletion of an edge from
a tree gives a forest of two trees. The interested reader is re ferred to, e.g., [ 25, Chapter 5] for
further properties and analysis related to trees and forest s.
Two simple graphs G= (V(G),E(G))andH= (V(H),E(H))are said to be isomorphic if there
is a bijection (i.e., a one-to-one and onto mapping) f:V(G)→V(H)that preserves adjacency
and non-adjacency, i.e., {u,v} ∈E(G)if and only if {f(u),f(v)} ∈E(H). The notation G∼=H
denotes that GandHare isomorphic graphs. An isomorphism from a graph to itself is called
anautomorphism of the graph.
A graph is called self-complementary ifGandGare isomorphic graphs. These include, e.g.,
the trivial complete graph on one vertex K1, the length-3 path P4, and the 5-cycle graph C5. IfG
is a self-complementary graph of order n, then the size of Gism=|E(G)|=1
2/parenleftbign

=1
4n(n−1).
Since only norn−1can be even, either n≡0(mod 4) orn≡1(mod 4) . For every such
n, there exists a recursive algorithm for constructing a self -complementary graph of order n
(see [ 20, Exercise 29]). More explicitly, if Gis a self-complementary graph of order n, then
its disjoint union with the length-3 path P4= [v1,v2,v3,v4], where each of the vertices v2
andv3inP4is connected to all the vertices in G, gives a self-complementary graph of order6
n+4. Starting with a graph Gthat is equal to P4orC5(for graph orders of n= 4 orn= 5,
respectively) gives, by the above suggested recursive cons truction, a self-complementary graph
of ordernfor all integers n >1such that n≡0(mod 4) orn≡1(mod 4) , respectively.
A graphGisvertex-transitive if for every two vertices of G, there is an automorphism of G
that maps one vertex to the other. Similarly, Gis said to be an edge-transitive graph if for every
two edges {u1,v1}and{u2,v2}ofG, there is an automorphism f:V(G)→V(G)of the graph
G, such that {u2,v2}={f(u1),f(v1)}. A vertex-transitive graph is necessarily regular, but the
opposite does not hold in general. Unlike a vertex-transiti ve graph, an edge-transitive graph is
not necessarily regular. Types of graph transitivity are st udied, e.g., in [ 37, Chapters 3–4].
All the eigenvalues of a d-regular graph Gare bounded in absolute value by d, and the largest
eigenvalue is equal to dwith an eigenvector that is equal to the all-ones column vect or (see,
e.g., [ 25, Proposition 12.1.1]). The multiplicity of the largest eig envalue of a d-regular graph
is 1 if and only if Gis connected (see, e.g., [ 25, Theorem 4.5.2 and Proposition 12.1.1]). A
graphGhas its eigenvalues symmetric around zero (including their multiplicities) if and only
ifGis bipartite (see, e.g., [ 25, Theorem 4.3.2]). Hence, the smallest eigenvalue of a d-regular
bipartite graph is equal to −d. Moreover, if Gisd-regular and connected, then Gis bipartite if
and only if −dis an eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix (see, e.g., [ 25, Proposition 12.1.1]). For
ad-regular graph G, let

A connected d-regular graph Gis called Ramanujan if
λ(G)≤2√
d−1. (7)
The reason for the expression in the right-hand side of ( 7) is related to the Alon–Boppana bound,
which addresses the question of how small can the second-lar gest eigenvalue be for a connected
d-regular graph or for a sequence of connected d-regular graphs whose number of vertices tends
to inﬁnity (the value of the parameter dis kept ﬁxed). It states that for every connected d-regular
graphGonnvertices, with d≥3,
λ2(G)≥2√
d−1−O/parenleftbig
(logdn)−1/parenrightbig
. (8)
A non-asymptotic version of ( 8) appears in [ 78] (see also [ 25, Theorem 12.2.1]). The Alon–
Boppana bound was ﬁrst mentioned in [ 6, p. 95], and it was analyzed, e.g., in [ 1], [2], [3], [21],
[22], [33], [34], [35], [61], [78], [79]. Moreover, all eigenvalues of a tree, with maximum degree
d≥2, are (in absolute value) at most 2√
d−1(see [ 73, Theorem 1]). Examples of Ramanujan
graphs include:
(a) The complete d-regular graph Kd+1, withd≥2, whose eigenvalues are equal to dwith
multiplicity 1, and −1with multiplicity d;
(b) The complete bipartite graph Kd,d, withd≥2, is ad-regular graph whose two nonzero
eigenvalues are ±d(each of multiplicity 1), and its other 2d−2eigenvalues are zeros.
(c) The Petersen graph, which is isomorphic to the Kneser gra phK(5,2), is a Ramanujan graph
since it is 3-regular with the distinct eigenvalues 3, −1, and−2.
The interested reader is referred to [ 73] for a recent survey paper on Ramanujan graphs, and
to references therein (see, e.g., [ 69] that proves the existence of inﬁnite families of bipartite
Ramanujan graphs of every degree greater than 2, followed by the extension of that result7
to bi-regular bipartite graphs; the proof in [ 69] uses an original technique for controlling the
eigenvalues of some random matrices).
LetGbe ad-regular graph of order n. The graph Gis said to be a strongly regular graph if
there exist nonnegative integers λandµsuch that the following two conditions hold:
•Every pair of adjacent vertices have exactly λcommon neighbors;
•Every pair of distinct and non-adjacent vertices have exact lyµcommon neighbors.
Such a strongly regular graph is denoted by srg(n,d,λ,µ). Some basic properties of strongly
regular graphs are next introduced, which also serve in our a nalysis.
(a) The complement of a strongly regular graph is also strong ly regular. More explicitly, the
complement of srg(n,d,λ,µ)is given by srg(n,n−d−1,n−2d+µ−2,n−2d+λ).
(b) The four parameters of a strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ)satisfy the relation
(n−d−1)µ=d(d−λ−1). (9)
(c) A strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ)has at most three distinct eigenvalues. If it is
connected, then λ1(G) =d(multiplicity 1), and the other two distinct eigenvalues ar e
p1,2=1
2/bracketleftbigg
λ−µ±/radicalbig
(λ−µ)2+4(d−µ)/bracketrightbigg
, (10)
whose respective multiplicities are given by
m1,2=1
2/bracketleftBigg
n−1∓2d+(n−1)(λ−µ)/radicalbig
(λ−µ)2+4(d−µ)/bracketrightBigg
. (11)
Since multiplicities of eigenvalues must be nonnegative in tegers, their expressions in ( 11)
provide further constraints on the values of n,d,λ andµ(in addition to equality ( 9)).
(d) A connected regular graph with exactly three distinct ei genvalues is strongly regular.
(e) A strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ), withµ >0, is a connected graph whose diameter
is equal to 2. This holds since two non-adjacent vertices hav eµ >0common neighbors,
so the distance between any pair of non-adjacent vertices is equal to 2. This can be also
explained by spectral graph theory since the diameter of a co nnected graph is strictly smaller
than the number of its distinct eigenvalues (see [ 25, Theorem 4.4.1]). In light of that, the
above claim about the diameter holds for all graphs that are c onnected and strongly regular
since these graphs only have three distinct eigenvalues.
(f) Ifµ= 0, the strongly regular graph is disconnected, and it is a disj oint union of equal-
sized complete graphs (i.e., a disjoint union of cliques of t he same size). A disjoint union
of an arbitrary number ℓ≥2of equal-sized complete graphs, Kd+1, has the parameters
srg((d+1)ℓ,d,d−1,0). In that case, d=p1(see ( 10)), so the largest and second-largest
eigenvalues coincide (by ( 11), that common eigenvalue has multiplicity m1+1 =ℓin the
graph spectrum). A strongly regular graph Gis called primitive if bothGand its complement
Gare connected graphs. Otherwise, Gis called imprimitive . An imprimitive graph is either
a disjoint union of equal-sized complete graphs or its compl ement, which is a complete
multipartite graph. A strongly regular graph Gis imprimitive if and only if 0 or −1is an
eigenvalue of G.8
(g) LetGbe a primitive strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ)with the largest eigenvalue d
(multiplicity 1), second-largest eigenvalue r=p1(multiplicity m1), and smallest eigenvalue
s=p2(multiplicity m2). By ( 3) and ( 4), the complement Gis a primitive strongly regular
graph, having the largest eigenvalue n−d−1(multiplicity 1), second-largest eigenvalue
−1−s(multiplicity m2), and smallest eigenvalue −1−r(multiplicity m1). Each of these
primitive strongly regular graphs has three distinct eigen values.
The reader is referred to [ 19], which is focused on properties and constructions of stron gly
regular graphs.
Part of this work is focused on the strong product of graphs, w hich is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1: LetG1andG2be two graphs. The strong product G=G1⊠G2is a graph
whose vertex set is V(G) =V(G1)×V(G2)(a Cartesian product), and distinct vertices {u1,u2}
and{v1,v2}inGare adjacent if one of the following three conditions is sati sﬁed:
(a)u1=v1and{u2,v2} ∈E(G2),
(b){u1,v1} ∈E(G1)andu2=v2,
(c){u1,v1} ∈E(G1)and{u2,v2} ∈E(G2).
A strong product of graphs is commutative in the sense that
G1⊠G2∼=G2⊠G1, (12)
and it is also associative in the sense that
(G1⊠G2)⊠G3∼=G1⊠(G2⊠G3), (13)
for every three graphs G1,G2andG3(see [ 46, Proposition 4.1]).
This paper relies on the Lov´aszθ-function of a graph [ 65], which is next introduced.
Deﬁnition 2: LetGbe a simple graph. An orthogonal representation ofGin thed-dimensional
Euclidean space (Rd)assigns to each vertex i∈V(G)a vectorui∈Rdsuch that uT
iuj= 0 if
{i,j}/∈E(G). In other words, the vertices of a simple graph are assigned v ectors inRdsuch that
the vectors that are assigned to any pair of distinct and non- adjacent vertices of that graph are
orthogonal. An orthonormal representation ofGis an orthogonal representation of that graph
such that all representing vectors have unit length.
Remark 1: In an orthogonal representation of a graph G, non-adjacent vertices are mapped
to orthogonal vectors, although adjacent vertices are not n ecessarily mapped to non-orthogonal
vectors. If the latter condition is satisﬁed, then the ortho gonal representation is said to be faithful .
Deﬁnition 3: LetGbe a ﬁnite, undirected and simple graph. Its Lov´aszθ-function is given by
θ(G)/definesmin
u,cmax
i∈V(G)1/parenleftbig
cTui/parenrightbig2, (14)
where the minimum is taken over all orthonormal representat ions{ui:i∈V(G)}ofG, and all
unit vectors c. The unit vector cis called the handle of the orthonormal representation.

only ifGis a complete graph.
The Lov´ asz θ-function of a graph can be written as a semideﬁnite program, which satisﬁes
strong duality ([ 41], [57], [66] and [ 67, Section 11.2]). This enables to compute the value of9
θ(G)in polynomial time [ 41]. More precisely, there is an algorithm that computes, for e very
graphGand every ε >0, a real number tsuch that/vextendsingle/vextendsingleθ(G)−t/vextendsingle/vextendsingle< ε, where the running time of
the algorithm is polynomial in n/defines|V(G)|andlog/parenleftbig1
ε/parenrightbig
[67, Theorem 11.11].
The following properties of the Lov´ asz θ-function are used throughout this paper:
(a) The sandwich theorem ([ 41], [57], [66, Lemma 3.2.4], [ 67, Theorem 11.1]) is stated in the
two equivalent forms
α(G)≤θ(G)≤χ(G), (15)
ω(G)≤θ(G)≤χ(G). (16)
(b) [ 65, Theorem 7]: The Lov´ asz θ-function factorizes for the strong product of graphs, i.e. ,
θ(G1⊠G2) =θ(G1)θ(G2). (17)
(c) [ 65, Corollary 2] and [ 65, Theorem 8]:
θ(G)θ(G)≥ |V(G)|, (18)
with equality in ( 18) if the graph Gis vertex-transitive.
(d) [ 65, Theorem 9]: Let Gbe ad-regular graph of order n. Then,
θ(G)≤ −nλn(G)
d−λn(G), (19)
whereλn(G)<0, unlessGis an empty graph. Equality holds in ( 19) ifGis edge-transitive.
(e) Two simple observations relating the Lov´ asz θ-functions of a graph and its subgraphs:
•IfFis a spanning subgraph of a graph G, thenθ(F)≥θ(G).
•IfFis an induced subgraph of a graph G, thenθ(F)≤θ(G).
(f) [4, Theorem 2]: Although unrelated to the analysis in this pape r, another interesting property
of the Lov´ asz θ-function is given by the identity
sup
Hα(G⊠H)
θ(G⊠H)= 1, (20)
which holds for every simple, ﬁnite, and undirected graph G, where the supremum is taken
over all such graphs H. This shows that the leftmost inequality in ( 15) can be made arbitrarily
tight by looking at the strong product of the given graph Gwith a suitable graph H.
The Shannon capacity of a simple, ﬁnite and undirected graph Gwas introduced in [ 86]
to determine the maximum information rate that enables erro r-free communication. To that
end, a discrete memoryless communication channel is repres ented by a confusion graph Gthat
is constructed as follows. The vertices in the graph are repr esented by the symbols of the
input alphabet to that channel, and any two distinct vertice s in that graph are adjacent if the
corresponding two input symbols are not distinguishable by the channel (in the sense that there
exists an output symbol such that the transition probabilit ies from each of these two input
symbols to that output symbol are strictly positive). This m eans that the exact values of the
positive transition probabilities of the channel, as well a s the output alphabet of the channel, are
irrelevant to the construction of the confusion graph G. The rationality in doing so is the interest
to pictorially represent (by a graph) all those pairs of inpu t symbols that are not distinguishable10
by the channel. Consider a transmission of k-length strings. The k-th confusion graph of the
channel is deﬁned as
G⊠k/definesG⊠...⊠G/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
k−1strong products, (21)
which is the k-fold strong power of G. This is because the independence number of G⊠kis
equal to the maximum number of k-length strings at the channel input that can be transmitted
with error-free communication (indeed, a pair of non-adjac ent vertices in G⊠krepresent k-length
strings that can be distinguished by the channel, as a result of having a common position in
these two input strings where the corresponding two symbols at that position are distinguishable
by the channel). Consequently, the maximum information rate per symbol that is achievable by
using input strings of length kis equal to1
klogα(G⊠k) = logk/radicalbig
α(G⊠k), for allk∈N(i.e.,
it is the logarithm of the maximum number of k-length input strings that are distinguishable by
the channel, normalized by the length k). The Shannon capacity of a graph Gis deﬁned to be
the (exponent of the) maximum information rate per symbol th at is achievable with error-free
communication, where the transmission takes place over a di screte memoryless channel whose
confusion graph is equal to G, and the length of the input strings to the channel is unlimit ed. It
is denoted by Θ(G)(recall that the Lov´ asz θ-function is denoted by θ(G)). Taking the supremum
overk, the Shannon capacity of Gis given by (see [ 86], and [ 5, Chapter 42])
Θ(G) = sup
k∈Nk/radicalBig
α(G⊠k). (22)
The Shannon capacity can be rarely computed exactly (see, e. g., [7], [9], [43], [51], [52], [58],
[65], [86]). Analytical observations that also explain why it is, in g eneral, even difﬁcult to
approximate it are addressed in [ 10] and [ 39]. Calculable upper bounds on Θ(G)were derived
by Shannon [ 86], Lov´ asz [ 65], Haemers [ 43], and more recently by Hu et al. [51]. The Lov´ asz
θ-function θ(G)is a calculable upper bound on the graph capacity Θ(G), i.e.,
α(G)≤Θ(G)≤θ(G), (23)
where the leftmost inequality in ( 23) follows from ( 22) (by setting k= 1), and the rightmost
inequality in ( 23) is [ 65, Theorem 1]. In regard to the rightmost inequality in ( 23), it is also
shown in [ 9] that the Lov´ asz θ-function of a graph, θ(G), cannot be upper bounded by any
function of its Shannon capacity Θ(G). As mentioned above, the computational task of the
Lov´ aszθ-function, θ(G), is in general feasible by semideﬁnite programming. Fundam ental graph
parameters such as its Shannon capacity Θ(G), independence number α(G), clique number ω(G),
and chromatic number χ(G)are all NP-hard problems. The polynomial-time computabili ty of
the Lov´ asz θ-function of a graph makes inequalities ( 15), (16), and ( 23) very useful in obtaining
polynomial-time computable upper bounds on the independen ce number, clique number, and the
Shannon capacity of a graph, as well as having such a computab le lower bound on the chromatic
number.11
III. T HEOREMS , DISCUSSIONS AND EXAMPLES
The present section provides the results of this work, follo wed by examples and discussions.
It is composed of ﬁve subsections that address issues relate d to the Lov´ asz θ-function, Shannon
capacity of graphs, Ramanujan graphs, eigenvalues, and chr omatic numbers of strong graph
products or strong graph powers.
A. Bounds on Lov ´aszθ-function, and an exact result for strongly regular graphs
LetGbe ad-regular graph on nvertices, and let Gbe the complement graph of Gthat is an
(n−d−1)-regular graph of order n. An upper bound on θ(G)and a lower bound on θ(G)were
obtained by Lov´ asz, expressed in terms of the smallest eige nvalue of the adjacency matrix of
G(see [ 65, Theorem 9] and [ 65, Corollary 3]). The novelties in the next result (Propositi on1)
are as follows:
(a) It forms a counterpart of a bound by Lov´ asz [ 65, Theorem 9], providing a lower bound on
θ(G)and an upper bound on θ(G)that are both expressed in terms of the second-largest
eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of G.
(b) It asserts that these two pairs of upper and lower bounds o nθ(G)andθ(G)are tight for
the family of strongly regular graphs. This gives a simple cl osed-form expression of the
Lov´ aszθ-function of a strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ)(and the complement graph) as
a function of its four parameters.
(c) Further sufﬁcient conditions for the tightness of these bounds are provided.
Proposition 1: LetGbe ad-regular graph of order n, which is a non-complete and non-empty
graph. Then, the following bounds hold for the Lov´ asz θ-function of Gand its complement G:
(a)
n−d+λ2(G)
1+λ2(G)≤θ(G)≤ −nλn(G)
d−λn(G). (24)
•Equality holds in the leftmost inequality of ( 24) ifGis both vertex-transitive and
edge-transitive, or if Gis a strongly regular graph;
•Equality holds in the rightmost inequality of ( 24) ifGis edge-transitive, or if Gis a
strongly regular graph.
(b)
1−d
λn(G)≤θ(G)≤n/parenleftbig
1+λ2(G)/parenrightbig
n−d+λ2(G). (25)
•Equality holds in the leftmost inequality of ( 25) ifGis both vertex-transitive and
edge-transitive, or if Gis a strongly regular graph;
•Equality holds in the rightmost inequality of ( 25) ifGis edge-transitive, or if Gis a
strongly regular graph.
Proof: See Section IV-A1 .
Remark 2: In light of the sufﬁcient conditions for each of the four ineq ualities in Proposition 1
to hold with equality, deﬁne the following subfamilies of re gular graphs:
•LetG1be the family of graphs Gsuch that Gis both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive;12
•LetG2be the family of regular and edge-transitive graphs;
•LetG3be the family of graphs Gsuch that Gis regular and edge-transitive;
•LetG4be the family of graphs that are both vertex-transitive and e dge-transitive;
•LetG5be the family of the strongly regular graphs.
We next show by explicit examples, obtained by using the Sage Math software [ 85], that none
of the families G1,G2G3andG4is included in the family G5, and vice versa.
(a) The Cameron graph is a strongly regular graph srg(231,30,9,3)(see [ 19, Section 10.54]).
Its complement is vertex-transitive (hence, regular), but not edge-transitive. This shows that
G5/ne}ationslash⊆ G3, so also G5/ne}ationslash⊆ G1.
(b) The complement of the Cameron graph is a strongly regular graphsrg(231,200,172,180) ;
it is vertex-transitive (hence, regular), but not edge-tra nsitive. This shows that G5/ne}ationslash⊆ G2, so
alsoG5/ne}ationslash⊆ G4.
(c) The Foster graph is 3-regular on 90 vertices (see [ 19, p. 305]), which is vertex-transitive
and edge-transitive, but it is not strongly regular. This sh ows thatG4/ne}ationslash⊆ G5, so alsoG2/ne}ationslash⊆ G5.
(d) The complement of the Foster graph is an 86-regular graph on 90 vertices, whose complement
(i.e., the Foster graph) is vertex-transitive and edge-tra nsitive, but it is not strongly regular.
This shows that G1/ne}ationslash⊆ G5, so also G3/ne}ationslash⊆ G5.
The next result provides a closed-form expression of the Lov ´ aszθ-function for strongly regular
graphs (and their strongly regular complements). This resu lt relies on Proposition 1and the
closed-form expressions of the distinct eigenvalues of a st rongly regular graph.
Corollary 1: LetGbe a strongly regular graph with parameters srg(n,d,λ,µ). Then,
θ(G) =n(t+µ−λ)
2d+t+µ−λ, (26)
and
θ(G) =n
θ(G)(27)
= 1+2d
t+µ−λ, (28)
where
t/defines/radicalbig
(µ−λ)2+4(d−µ). (29)
Furthermore, if 2d+(n−1)(λ−µ)/ne}ationslash= 0, thenθ(G)andθ(G)are rational numbers.
Proof: See Section IV-A2 .
Remark 3: By (27), ifGis a strongly regular graph on nvertices, then θ(G)θ(G) =n. This
relation is also known to hold if the graph Gis vertex-transitive [ 65, Theorem 8]. It should be
noted that not all the strongly regular graphs are necessari ly vertex-transitive, so the observation
here is not implied by [ 65, Theorem 8]. As a counter example for strongly regular graph s that
are not vertex-transitive, consider the Chang graphs. Thes e are three of the existing four non-
isomorphic strongly regular graphs with parameters srg(28,12,6,4)[19, Section 10.11] (the
fourth such graph, denoted by T8, is the line graph of the complete graph on 8 vertices K8). The
three Chang graphs are not vertex-transitive and also not ed ge-transitive (in contrast to T8that
is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive), as it can be ver iﬁed by the SageMath software [ 85].13
Remark 4: The 5-cycle C5is a strongly regular graph srg(5,2,0,1). Its Lov´ asz θ-function
coincides with its Shannon capacity, being equal to√
5(see [ 65, Theorem 2]). Although it is an
irrational number, it is consistent with Corollary 1since2d+(n−1)(λ−µ) = 2·2+4(0−1) = 0 .
B. Eigenvalue inequalities, strongly regular graphs, and R amanujan graphs
The present subsection relies on Proposition 1, with the following contributions:
(a) Derivation of inequalities that relate the second-larg est and smallest eigenvalues of a regular
graph. These inequalities hold with equality if and only if t he graph is strongly regular.
(b) Derivation of bounds on parameters of Ramanujan graphs.
(c) A more general result is presented for a sequence of regul ar graphs whose degrees scale
sub-linearly with the orders of these graphs, and their orde rs tend to inﬁnity.
This subsection is composed of Corollaries 2–6, which all rely on Proposition 1. It starts by
providing eigenvalue inequalities.
Corollary 2: LetGbe ad-regular graph of order n, which is non-complete and non-empty.
Then,
λn(G)≤ −d(n−d+λ2(G))
d+(n−1)λ2(G), (30)
or equivalently,
λ2(G)≥ −d(n−d+λn(G))
d+(n−1)λn(G). (31)
Furthermore, ( 30) and ( 31) hold with equality if and only if Gis a strongly regular graph.
Proof: See Section IV-B1 .
The next result introduces, in part, Nordhaus–Gaddum type i nequalities for the second-largest
and smallest eigenvalues of regular graphs, which are tight for all strongly regular graphs.
Regarding Nordhaus–Gaddum type inequalities, the interes ted reader is referred to [ 76], [77],
and [ 80].
Corollary 3: LetGbe ad-regular graph of order n, which is non-complete and non-empty,
and let
gℓ(G)/definesλℓ(G)−d(n−d+λℓ(G))
d+(n−1)λℓ(G),∀ℓ∈[n]. (32)
The following holds:
(a)
gn(G)≤ −1≤g2(G), (33)
and the two inequalities in ( 33) hold with equality if and only if Gis strongly regular.
(b) IfGis a strongly regular graph, then the number of distinct valu es in the sequence {gℓ(G)}n
ℓ=1
is either 2 or 3, and
•it is equal to 2 if the multiplicities of the second-largest a nd smallest eigenvalues of
Gare identical in the subsequence (λ2(G),...,λ n(G));
•it is otherwise equal to 3.14
(c) IfGis self-complementary, then
λ2(G)≥1
2/parenleftbig√n−1/parenrightbig
, (34)
λn(G)≤ −1
2/parenleftbig√n+1/parenrightbig
. (35)
(d) IfGis self-complementary and strongly regular, then ( 34) and ( 35) hold with equality.
Proof: See Section IV-B2 .
Example 1: Item (b) of Corollary 3refers to the dichotomy in the number of distinct values in
the sequence {gℓ(G)}n
ℓ=1. This statement applies to all strongly regular graphs (eit her connected
or disconnected). We believe that the following example con tributes to its clarity, in addition
to its formal proof in Section IV-B2 . LetGbe a disjoint union of the three complete graphs
K2, which gives a disconnected strongly regular graph. Its com plement is the complete 3-partite
graphG=K2,2,2, son= 6, and
{λℓ(G)}6
ℓ=1= (1,1,1,−1,−1,−1), (36)
{λℓ(G)}6
ℓ=1= (4,0,0,0,−2,−2), (37)
{gℓ(G)}6
ℓ=1= (3,−1,−1,1,−1,−1). (38)
By ( 36), the multiplicities of λ2(G)andλn(G)in the spectrum of Gare identical, but these
multiplicities are distinct in the subsequence {λℓ(G)}6
ℓ=2= (1,1,−1,−1,−1). Hence, the fact
that the sequence {gℓ(G)}6
ℓ=1gets three distinct values is indeed consistent with the cla im in
Item (b) of Corollary 3.
Example 2: LetGbe the Hall-Janko graph, which is a strongly regular graph wi th parameters
srg(100,36,14,12) (see Section 10.32 of [ 19]). As a numerical veriﬁcation of Item (b) in
Corollary 3(and its proof in Section IV-B2 ), the sequence {gℓ(G)}100
ℓ=1in (32) gets the three
distinct values: n−d−2 = 62 (atℓ= 1),−1(for2≤ℓ≤37or65≤ℓ≤100), and 9
(for38≤ℓ≤64). The third value (9) is attained by the sequence {gℓ(G)}twenty-seven times.
By the proof of Item (b) in Corollary 3, the multiplicity of the third value (27) is equal to the
absolute value of the difference between the multiplicitie s of the second-largest and smallest
eigenvalues of the graph G. The spectrum of the graph Gis given by 361636(−4)63(this can
be veriﬁed by ( 10) and ( 11)), and the above difference (in absolute value) is indeed eq ual
to|63−36|= 27 . Next, let Gbe the 5-cycle graph C5, which is a strongly regular graph
with parameters srg(5,2,0,1). The second-largest and smallest eigenvalues of Gare equal to
1
2(√
5−1)and−1
2(√
5 + 1) , respectively, and their multiplicities coincide, being b oth equal
to 2. In light of Item (b) in Corollary 3, the sequence {gℓ(G)}5
ℓ=1in (32) gets only two distinct
values:n−d−2 = 1 atℓ= 1, and−1for2≤ℓ≤5.
Remark 5: We discuss here an implication of the conditions for equalit ies in Proposition 1.
LetGbe ad-regular graph. Inequality ( 30) holds with equality if and only if both inequalities
in (24) hold with equality. By Item (a) of Proposition 1, the leftmost inequality in ( 24) holds
with equality if Gis both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, and the rig htmost inequality in
(24) holds with equality if Gis edge-transitive. Combining both sufﬁcient conditions f or the
two inequalities in ( 24) to hold with equality, it follows that a sufﬁcient conditio n for equality15
in (30) is given by the requirement that GandGare both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive
(recall that Gis vertex-transitive if and only if Gis so).
By Corollary 2, inequality ( 30) holds with equality if and only if Gis strongly regular.
By a comparison of the former (sufﬁcient) condition with the latter (necessary and sufﬁcient)
condition for equality to hold in ( 30), it follows that if GandGare both vertex-transitive and
edge-transitive, then Gis strongly regular.
It should be noted, with gratitude to an anonymous reviewer, that a stronger result can be
obtained by replacing the requirement of the vertex-transi tivity with the weaker condition of
regularity. Namely, if Gis regular, and GandGare both edge-transitive, then Gis strongly
regular. This can be shown as follows.
•(Gis edge transitive) ⇒(every edge in Gis contained in the same number of triangles)
⇔(every pair of adjacent vertices in Ghas the same number of common neighbors);
•(Gis edge transitive) ⇒(for every edge {u,v} ∈E(G), the same number of vertices are
not adjacent in Gto either uorv)⇔(every pair of non-adjacent vertices in Ghas the
same number of common neighbors);
•Gis regular (by assumption);
and these observations correspond to the conditions in the d eﬁnition of a strongly regular graph.
Example 3: The Schl¨ aﬂi graph G1is 16-regular on 27 vertices. Both G1and its complement
are edge-transitive. By Remark 5, the graph G1is indeed strongly regular; its parameters are
given by srg(27,16,10,8)[19, Section 10.10].
Consider, on the other hand, the Shrikhande graph G2which is 6-regular on 16 vertices. It
is a strongly regular graph with parameters srg(16,6,2,2)[19, Section 10.6]. The graph G2is
edge-transitive, but its complement is notedge-transitive (this was veriﬁed by the SageMath
software [ 85]). In addition, the Cameron graph G3is a strongly regular graph srg(231,30,9,3)
[19, Section 10.54]. It can be veriﬁed that it is edge-transitiv e, and that its complement is not
edge-transitive. This shows that the family of regular grap hsGwith the property that Gand its
complement Gare both edge-transitive is a strict subset of the family of strongly regular graphs.
Remark 6: In continuation to Example 3, strongly-regular graphs Gsuch that GandGare
both edge-transitive include, e.g., the Hall-Janko, Hoffm an-Singleton, Mesner, Petersen, Schl¨ aﬂi,
Sims-Gewirtz, and Suzuki graphs (this has been veriﬁed by th e SageMath software [ 85]; for the
introduction of these graphs, the reader is referred to [ 19]). It also includes the inﬁnite families
of Paley and Peisert graphs ([ 72], [81]), which are self-complementary and arc-transitive graph s.
(All self-complementary and arc-transitive graphs are str ongly regular).
Remark 7: In connection to Remark 5, two related statements have been proved by Neumaier:
(a) A connected, edge-transitive and strongly regular grap h is vertex-transitive [ 74, Lemma 1.3].
(b) A vertex-transitive and edge-transitive graph contain ing a regular clique is strongly regular
(see [ 75, Corollary 2.4]). (A clique Cis called regular if every vertex not in Cis adjacent
to the same positive number of vertices in C).
Strongly regular graphs that are both vertex- and edge-tran sitive are studied in [ 71].16

graph parameters.

Remark 8: Inequalities ( 40), (43), and ( 46) can be also obtained from [ 42, Theorem 2.1.3],
which states that for an arbitrary simple, ﬁnite, and undire cted graph Gonnvertices, whose
maximal degree is given by ∆(G), the following bound on the clique number of Gholds:
ω(G)≤n/parenleftbig
d+λ1(G)λ2(G)/parenrightbig
dn−∆(G)2+λ1(G)λ2(G). (49)
For ad-regular graph Gonnvertices, we have λ1(G) =d= ∆(G), which then specializes ( 49)
to (see [ 42, Theorem 2.1.4])
ω(G)≤n/parenleftbig
1+λ2(G)/parenrightbig

Inequality ( 46) can be also obtained from ( 50), combined with the satisﬁability of the inequality/vextendsingle/vextendsingleλ2(G)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤2√
d−1ifGis a Ramanujan d-regular graph, together with the fact that the right-
hand side of ( 50) is monotonically increasing in the parameter λ2(G).
C. Bounds on eigenvalues of strong products of regular graph s
A small second-largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix o f a regular graph implies that the
graph is a good expander (see, e.g., [ 25, Theorem 12.1.2], and [ 6], [28], [50], [53], [59], [68]).
The Alon–Boppana bound in ( 8) is a lower bound on the second-largest eigenvalue of a
connected regular graph (see Section II). By the Alon–Boppana bound, for every sequence
{Gk}∞
k=1of connected d-regular graphs, with a ﬁxed integer d≥3and orders tending to inﬁnity
(i.e.,lim
k→∞|V(Gk)|=∞), the second-largest eigenvalues of their adjacency matri ces satisfy
liminf
k→∞λ2(Gk)≥2√
d−1, (51)
(see, e.g., [ 25, Theorem 12.1.2]). This lower bound is asymptotically tigh t, and its tightness can
be strengthened beyond the second-largest eigenvalue. Mor e explicitly, by Serre’s theorem [ 61],
for every ﬁxed integer d≥3and (an arbitrarily small) ε >0, there exists a positive constant
c=c(ε,d)such that every d-regular graph on nvertices has at least cneigenvalues that are
larger than or equal to 2√
d−1−ε. In other words, Serre’s theorem states that a non-vanishin g
fraction of the neigenvalues of every d-regular graph has the property of satisfying the Alon–
Boppana lower bound within the desired accuracy (see a simpl iﬁed proof in [ 25, Theorem 12.2.3]
or [21, Theorem 1]). Analogous theorems, concerning the least eig envalues of d-regular graphs,
also hold under an additional hypothesis that the graphs do n ot have odd cycles below a certain
length (see [ 21, Section 4]). It overall justiﬁes the deﬁnition of Ramanuja n graphs (see ( 7))
as connected d-regular graphs whose all non-trivial eigenvalues are (in a bsolute value) at most
2√
d−1.
For ak-fold strong power of a d-regular graph, the degree is increased exponentially in k,
being equal to dk= (1+d)k−1. It is therefore of interest to obtain an alternative lower b ound
on the second-largest eigenvalue of strong products of regu lar graphs. Its derivation is motivated
by the signiﬁcance of strong products, and in particular str ong powers of a given graph:
(1) The graph capacity in Shannon’s problem of zero-error co mmunication [ 86] is given in ( 22),
which is expressed in terms of the independence numbers of al lk-fold strong powers of the
graph (with k∈N);
(2) The Witsenhausen rate [ 94] in the zero-error source coding problem, with perfect side
information at the receiver, is expressed in a dual form to ( 22), where the independence
numbers of k-fold strong powers of a graph (with k∈N) are replaced by their chromatic
numbers, and the supremum over kis replaced by an inﬁmum (see [ 7, Section 3]);
(3) There exists a polynomial-time algorithm that ﬁnds the u nique prime factorization of any
connected graph under the operation of strong graph multipl ication [ 31].
It is demonstrated in this section that, under a certain cond ition, the suggested lower bound
on the second-largest eigenvalue of the k-fold strong power of a regular graph offers a larger
exponential growth rate in k, as compared to the Alon–Boppana bound.18
The following proposition provides a lower bound on the seco nd-largest eigenvalue, and an
upper bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matr ices of strong products of regular
graphs. Their derivation relies on Proposition 1, jointly with the factorization property in ( 17).
Both bounds are expressed in terms of the Lov´ asz θ-function of each factor. This enables to
obtain analytical bounds on the second-largest and smalles t eigenvalues of a k-fold strong power
of a regular graph, with a low computational complexity that is not affected by k. This stays
in contrast to the computational complexity of these eigenv alues, which signiﬁcantly increases
withk.
Proposition 2: LetG1,...,Gkbe regular graphs such that, for all ℓ∈[k], the graph Gℓis

and inequality ( 53) holds with equality if, for all ℓ∈[k], the regular graph Gℓis either
edge-transitive or strongly regular.
(b) Unless all Gℓ(withℓ∈[k]) are empty graphs, then

If each regular graph Gℓ(withℓ∈[k]) is either edge-transitive or strongly regular, then ( 54)
can be expressed in an equivalent form as
λmin(G1⊠...⊠Gk)≤ −k/producttext
ℓ=1(1+dℓ)−1
k/producttext
ℓ=1/parenleftbigg

Proof: See Section IV-C1 .
Remark 9: As a sanity check, it would be in place to verify that the lower bound on the
second-largest eigenvalue in the right-hand side of ( 52) is smaller than or equal to the largest
eigenvalue of the strong product:
λmax(G1⊠...⊠Gk) =k/productdisplay
ℓ=1(1+dℓ)−1. (56)19
First, equality ( 56) holds since G1⊠...⊠Gkisd-regular with a value of dthat is equal to the
right-hand side of ( 56). Straightforward algebra reveals that the required inequ ality we wish to
assert readily follows from the inequalities
θ(Gℓ)≥α(Gℓ)≥nℓ
1+dℓ, ℓ∈[k]. (57)
Indeed, the ﬁrst inequality in ( 57) holds since the Lov´ asz θ-function of a graph is an upper
bound on its graph capacity (see [ 65, Theorem 1]), and (by deﬁnition) the graph capacity is
larger than or equal to the independence number of the graph. The second inequality in ( 57)
holds by Wei’s inequality [ 92], which provides a lower bound on the independence number or
the clique number of a ﬁnite simple graph as a function of the d egrees of its vertices (see, e.g.,
[5, p. 287] or [ 8, p. 100] for a nice probabilistic proof of these inequalitie s; for some further
such bounds, see [ 40]). For a simple graph Gof ordern, where vertex i∈[n]is of degree di,
Wei’s bound states that
α(G)≥n/summationdisplay
i=11
1+di, ω(G)≥n/summationdisplay
i=11
n−di, (58)
so the ﬁrst inequality in ( 58) is specialized to the second inequality in ( 57) for adℓ-regular
graphGℓof order nℓ. It should be noted that the pair of inequalities in ( 57) also imply that,
unless not all graphs {Gℓ}are empty, the upper bound on λmin(G1⊠...⊠Gk)in the right-hand
side of ( 54) is smaller than or equal to −1. It is a desired property of this upper bound since
the smallest eigenvalue of a non-empty and ﬁnite regular gra ph is smaller than or equal to −1,
while attaining this value if the graph is complete.
Corollary 7: LetGad-regular graph of order n. Then, for all k∈N, the second-largest and
smallest eigenvalues of the k-fold strong power of Gsatisfy the inequalities

Example 4: By Corollary 7, the second-largest eigenvalue of the k-fold strong power of the
5-cycle (pentagon) graph C5satisﬁes
λ2(C⊠k
5)≥5k−3k
5k
2−1−1, k∈N, (61)
which holds since θ(C5) =√
5(it is also the Shannon capacity of the pentagon [ 65, Theorem 2]),
andC5is 2-regular ( d= 2). The lower bound on λ2(C⊠k
5)in the right-hand side of ( 61) scales
asymptotically (for large k) like5k
2. It is next compared with the Alon–Boppana lower bound.
Thek-fold strong power of C5is adk-regular graph with dk= (1+d)k−1 = 3k−1. The Alon–
Boppana lower bound in ( 8) is slightly smaller than 2√dk−1, which scales asymptotically like
2·3k
2. This exempliﬁes an improvement in the exponential growth r ate of the lower bound in
(61), as compared to the Alon–Boppana lower bound.20
We next compare the exact values of λ2(C⊠k
5), for1≤k≤5, with their lower bounds
in the right-hand side of ( 61) (these exact values were calculated numerically by the Sag eMath
software [ 85], and their numerical computation for k >5seems to be a difﬁcult task). The exact
values of λ2(C⊠k
5), fork= 1,...,5, are equal to 0.6180,3.8541,13.5623,42.6869,130.0608 ,
respectively (with 4 digit decimal precision), in comparis on to the lower bound in the right-hand
side of ( 61) that is equal to 0.6180,3.0000,8.6264,21.3333 and51.4938 , respectively.
The following result refers to connected regular graphs tha t are non-complete and non-empty,
and that their Lov´ asz θ-function is below a certain value (that value depends on the order
and valency of the regular graph). It is asserted that every s uch a graph has the property that
almost all its strong powers are non-Ramanujan graphs. The d erivation of that result relies on
inequality ( 59).
Proposition 3: LetGbe a connected d-regular graph on nvertices, which is non-empty and
non-complete. If
θ(G)<n√
d+1, (62)
then there exists k0∈Nsuch that, for all k≥k0, thek-fold strong power G⊠kis (highly)
non-Ramanujan. An explicit closed-form expression for the value ofk0is given by

This holds, in particular, for all ﬁnite graphs that are self -complementary and vertex-transitive
(they all satisfy the condition in ( 62) ifn >1), with a value of k0which, respectively, is equal
to 5, 4 or 3 if n= 5,n= 9 orn≥13withn≡1(mod 4) .
Proof: See Section IV-C3 .
Remark 10: A necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of a se lf-complementary
graph on nvertices is that n≡0(mod 4) orn≡1(mod 4) (see [ 20, pp. 16–17]). A self-
complementary and d-regular graph of order nsatisﬁesd=n−1
2, which implies that nneeds to
be odd. Since a vertex-transitive graph is regular, the opti on ofn≡0(mod 4) is rejected for
graphs of order nthat are self-complementary and vertex-transitive. This i mplies that the order
nof such graphs must satisfy n≡1(mod 4) . Forn= 1andn= 5, there exist graphs of order
nthat are self-complementary and vertex-transitive; they a re, respectively, given by K1andC5.
Graphs that are self-complementary and vertex-transitive , and approaches for their construction,
received attention in the literature (see, e.g., [ 60], [62], [63], [65], [81], [82], [83]).
Remark 11: Proposition 3was inspired by Example 4, referring to the 5-cycle graph C5that
is self-complementary and vertex-transitive. It can be num erically veriﬁed, with the SageMath
software [ 85], thatC5andC⊠2
5are Ramanujan graphs, and then the higher strong powers C⊠3
5,
C⊠4
5,C⊠5
5are non-Ramanujan graphs. Proposition 3shows that all strong powers C⊠k
5, with
k≥5, are non-Ramanujan graphs. An expression for k0, as it is given in ( 63), was derived in
order to reduce the minimal analytical value of k0for which the k-fold strong power of C5is
asserted to be non-Ramanujan for all k≥k0. It started with an initial value of k0= 8forn= 5,
with a more simple initial expression for k0, and it was reduced to k0= 5with the closed-form21
expression in ( 63). Proposition 3, and the numerical experimentation as above, gives that C⊠k
5
is a Ramanujan graph if and only if k= 1 ork= 2.
Example 5: Consider the connected Kneser graphs G=K(m,r)withm >2randm,r∈N.

The expression of θ(G)in (64) relies on the proof of [ 65, Theorem 13], which shows that
α(G) = Θ(G) =θ(G)(it holds by combining the Erd¨ os-Ko-Rado theorem for ﬁnite sets, which
serves to determine the independence number of the graph, to gether with the upper bound
onθ(G)in [65, Theorem 9]). Straightforward algebra shows that the condi tion in ( 62) is not
necessarily satisﬁed for the set of parameters in ( 64). For example, by selecting m= 2r+1, the
condition in ( 62) is satisﬁed if and only if 1≤r≤3(e.g., it is satisﬁed by the Petersen graph,
which corresponds to r= 2). The condition in ( 62) is violated for r≥4so, for these values of
the parameter r, the exponential growth rate of the Alon–Boppana lower boun d onλ2(G⊠k)is
larger than the exponent of the suggested lower bound in the r ight-hand side of ( 59).
Remark 12: Several methods for obtaining upper bounds on the smallest e igenvalue of a graph
Grely on the identity λmin(G) = min
x/negationslash=0xTAx
xTx(see, e.g., [ 27]). The dimensions of the adjacency
matrix of a k-fold strong power of a graph Ggrow exponentially in k, so the computational
complexity of such bounds is typically very high for strong g raph powers. However, for strong
powers, the eigenvalue bounds in Corollary 7are analytical, and their computational complexity
is not affected by k. The reader is also referred to recent works which derive low er bounds on
the smallest eigenvalue of a graph based on graph decomposit ions [ 23], and lower bounds on the
smallest eigenvalue of regular graphs containing many copi es of a smaller ﬁxed subgraph [ 24].
Such lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of a regular gra ph transform to upper bounds
on the second-largest eigenvalue of regular graphs by using equality ( 5). Some upper bounds
on the second-largest eigenvalue of connected graphs, with conditions for their attainability, are
provided in [ 96]. The paper [ 49] surveys (less recent) bounds on the eigenvalues of simple g raphs.
D. Lower bounds on the chromatic numbers of strong products
The problem of relating the chromatic number of a graph to its eigenvalues dates back to
Haemers [ 42, Section 2.2], Hoffman [ 48] and Wilf [ 93], obtaining upper and lower bounds on the
chromatic numbers of graphs in terms of their largest, secon d-largest and smallest eigenvalues.
This section presents lower bounds on the chromatic number o f a strong product of graphs
(and its complement) in terms of the Lov´ asz θ-functions (or smallest eigenvalues) of its factors.
Proposition 4: The following lower bounds on chromatic numbers of strong pr oducts hold:
(a) LetG1,...,Gkbeksimple graphs,/vextendsingle/vextendsingleV(Gℓ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=nℓforℓ∈[k], andG=G1⊠...⊠Gk. Then,

, (65)
χ(G)≥/ceilingleftBiggk/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ)/ceilingrightBigg

(b) LetG1,...,Gkbe regular graphs, where Gℓisdℓ-regular of order nℓfor allℓ∈[k]. Then,

(67)

, (68)
and inequality ( 68) holds with equality if each regular graph Gℓis either edge-transitive or
strongly regular.
(c) If, for all ℓ∈[k],Gℓisdℓ-regular, and it is either edge-transitive or strongly regu lar, then
k/productdisplay
ℓ=1/parenleftbigg
1−dℓ
λmin(Gℓ)/parenrightbigg
≥1−d(G)
λmin(G), (69)
where
d(G) =k/productdisplay
ℓ=1(1+dℓ)−1 (70)
is the valency of the regular graph G=G1⊠...⊠Gk, andλmin(G)is its smallest eigenvalue.
(d) LetG1,...,Gkbe regular graphs, where Gℓisdℓ-regular of order nℓfor allℓ∈[k].
(1) If, for all ℓ∈[k], the graph Gℓis either vertex-transitive or strongly regular, then the
lower bound on χ(G)in the right-hand side of ( 65) is larger than or equal to the lower
boundk/producttext
ℓ=1ω(Gℓ).
(2) If, for all ℓ∈[k], the graph Gℓis either (i) both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive,
or (ii) strongly regular, then the lower bound on χ(G)in the right-hand side of ( 68) is
larger than or equal to the lower boundk/producttext
ℓ=1ω(Gℓ).
(e) Let, for all ℓ∈[k], the graph Gℓbedℓ-regular on nℓvertices, and suppose that it is either
edge-transitive or strongly regular. Then,
χ(G)≥/ceilingleftBiggk/productdisplay
ℓ=1/parenleftbigg
−nℓλmin(Gℓ)

. (71)
(f) Let, for all ℓ∈[k],Gℓbe a self-complementary graph on nℓvertices that is either vertex-
transitive or strongly regular. Let n/definesk/producttext
ℓ=1nℓbe the order of G=G1⊠...⊠Gn. Then,
χ(G)≥/ceilingleftbig√n/ceilingrightbig
, (72)
χ(G)≥/ceilingleftbig√n/ceilingrightbig
. (73)
Proof: See Section IV-D1 .
Remark 13: The following inequality is proved in [ 4, Theorem 11]:
χ(G1⊠G2)≥θ(G1)θ(G2). (74)
(Analogous inequalities to ( 74) were derived by Hales [ 45], and by McEliece and Posner [ 70];
see [ 4, Theorem 10]). Inequality ( 65) can be obtained by combining ( 17), (18) and ( 74). This23
can be done by ﬁrst replacing G1andG2in (74) withG′
1/definesG1andG′
2/definesG2⊠...⊠Gk,
respectively, then relying on ( 18) to get the inequalities θ(G′
1)≥n1
θ(G1)andθ(G′
2)≥n2...nk
θ(G′
2), and
ﬁnally relying on ( 17) to get the equality θ(G′
2) =θ(G2)...θ(Gk). Our two simple proofs of
(65) are, however, easier than this one, and they do not require t o rely on ( 74).
Remark 14: Inequality ( 74) differs from ( 66), although the lower bounds in the right-hand
sides are similar for k= 2. The difference between ( 66) and ( 74) is that the left-hand side of
(66) refers to the chromatic number of G1⊠G2, whereas the left-hand side of ( 74) refers to
G1⊠G2. The result in ( 66) appears in Proposition 4for completeness since it is an immediate
consequence of the sandwich theorem in ( 15), and the identity in ( 17).
Remark 15: Under the assumptions of Item (c) in Proposition 4, the lower bound on χ(G)
in the right-hand side of ( 68) is larger than or equal to Hoffman’s lower bound (see ( 69)).
This holds in addition to the high complexity in computing λmin(G)in the right-hand side of
(69), even for relatively small values of k. Hoffman’s bound was originally proved for regular
graphs [ 48], and it was later extended by Haemers to general simple and ﬁ nite graphs (see,
[18, Proposition 3.5.3], [ 42, Theorem 2.1.3], [ 89, Corollary 8.10 and Theorem 8.11]), and to
hypergraphs [ 32]. A recent perspective on Hoffman’s bound appears in [ 44].
Remark 16: We refer to Item (f) of Proposition 4. IfGis self-complementary of order n, then
χ(G)≥/ceilingleftbig√n/ceilingrightbig
. (75)
Indeed, for every graph G,
χ(G)χ(G)≥θ(G)θ(G) (76)
≥n, (77)
where inequality ( 76) holds since, by ( 15) and ( 16),χ(G)≥θ(G)andχ(G)≥θ(G), and
inequality ( 77) holds by [ 65, Corollary 2]. The chromatic number is invariant under isom orphism,
soχ(G) =χ(G)ifGis self-complementary. This gives ( 75) from ( 77). It should be noted,
however, that the result in Item (f) (see ( 72) and ( 73)) is not implied by ( 75). This is because a
strong product of self-complementary graphs, where each fa ctor is also either vertex-transitive or
strongly regular, does not necessarily give a self-complem entary graph. As a counter example,
letG1=G2=C5. The pentagon C5is a self-complementary, vertex-transitive and strongly
regular graph, whereas G=C5⊠C5is not a self-complementary graph by [ 62, Theorem 1.1];
according to that theorem, Gwould have been self-complementary if the strong product of G1
andG2had been replaced by their lexicographic product (these las t two observations were also
veriﬁed by the SageMath software).
The next result specializes Item (a) of Proposition 4(see ( 65)) to strong products of strongly
regular graphs. This result is obtained by relying on Coroll ary1that provides a closed-form
expression for the Lov´ asz θ-function of each factor.
Corollary 8: LetG1,...,Gkbe strongly regular graphs with parameters srg(nℓ,dℓ,λℓ,µℓ)for
ℓ∈[k](they need not be distinct). Then, the chromatic number of th eir strong product satisﬁes

The leftmost term in ( 78) is also larger than or equal to the product of the clique numb ers of
the factors {Gℓ}k
ℓ=1.
Proof: See Section IV-D2 .
The next two examples present strong products of strongly re gular graphs, whose chromatic
numbers are exactly determined by Corollary 8.
Example 6: LetG1,G2,G3be the Schl¨ aﬂi, Shrikhande, and Hall-Janko graphs, respec tively.
These are strongly regular graphs whose parameters are srg(27,16,10,8),srg(16,6,2,2), and
srg(100,36,14,12), respectively. Their chromatic numbers are equal to χ(G1) = 9 ,χ(G2) = 4 ,
andχ(G3) = 10 . Consider the chromatic number of the strong product of arbi trary nonnegative
powers of G1,G2andG3. It can be veriﬁed that, for all such strong products, the upp er and
lower bounds in Corollary 8coincide, so for all integers k1,k2,k3≥0,
χ(G⊠k1
1⊠G⊠k2
2⊠G⊠k3
3) = 9k14k210k3. (80)
For comparison, the lower bound that is given by the product o f the clique numbers of each
factor is equal to 6k13k24k3(sinceω(G1) = 6 ,ω(G2) = 3 , andω(G3) = 4 ). This shows that it
is signiﬁcantly looser than the tight lower bound in the righ t-hand side of ( 80).
Example 7: Consider the three non-isomorphic Chang graphs. These are s trongly regular
graphs with the same set of parameters srg(28,12,6,4). The clique number of one of these
graphs is equal to 5, and the clique numbers of the other two gr aphs are equal to 6. Let us
denote these graphs by G1,G2andG3, such that ω(G1) = 5 ,ω(G2) = 6 , andω(G3) = 6 .
The chromatic numbers of all these three graphs are similar, and they are equal to 7, i.e.,
χ(G1) =χ(G2) =χ(G3) = 7 (the clique and chromatic numbers of the three Chang graphs
are easy to verify with the SageMath software [ 85]). Letk1,k2andk3be arbitrary nonnegative
integers. By Corollary 8,
χ(G⊠k1
1⊠G⊠k2
2⊠G⊠k3
3) = 7k1+k2+k3(81)
due to the coincidence of the upper and lower bounds in ( 78). For comparison, the lower bound
on the chromatic number in the left-hand side of ( 81), which is given by the product of the
clique numbers of each factor, is equal to 5k16k2+k3.
The next example presents a power product of a vertex and edge -transitive regular graph,
whose chromatic number is exactly determined by Item (b) of P roposition 4.
Example 8: The present example provides the exact value of χ(G⊠k)whereGis the Perkel
graph, and k∈N. The Perkel graph is 6-regular on 57 vertices, and it is both v ertex-transitive and
edge-transitive. The clique and chromatic numbers of Gare equal to ω(G) = 2 andχ(G) = 3 ,
respectively, and the smallest eigenvalue of (the adjacenc y matrix of) Gis equal to λmin(G) =−3.
By Item (b) of Proposition 4, for allk∈N,
χ(G⊠k)≥/parenleftbigg
1−d
λmin(G)/parenrightbiggk
= 3k, (82)
which can be compared here to the simple upper and lower bound s onχ(G⊠k)whose values
are given by χ(G)k= 3kandω(G)k= 2k, respectively. The coincidence of the improved lower
bound in ( 82) and the upper bound gives that, for all k∈N,
χ(G⊠k) = 3k. (83)25
The next two examples illustrate numerically Part 2 of Item ( d) in Proposition 4.
Example 9: LetGbe the Suzuki graph, which is a strongly regular graph with pa rameters
srg(1782,416,100,96) (see [ 19, Section 10.83]). The lower bound in Corollary 8(see the
leftmost term in ( 78)) gives that χ(G⊠k)≥27kfor allk∈N. For comparison, since ω(G) = 6 ,
the lower bound that is based on the clique number of Ggivesχ(G⊠k)≥6kfor allk∈N. The
exact value of χ(G)is not available for the Suzuki graph, so the upper bound in th e rightmost
term of ( 78) is unknown. The improvement in the exponential lower bound on the chromatic
number of the strong powers G⊠kis, however, signiﬁcant since it is increased from 6kto27k.
Example 10: LetGbe the Gosset graph. We apply here Item (b) of Proposition 4in order
to obtain an improved lower bound on χ(G⊠k)for allk∈N. The graph Gis 27-regular on
56 vertices (i.e., d= 27 andn= 56 ); it is both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive, and it is
also not strongly regular. The clique and chromatic numbers ofGare equal to ω(G) = 7 and
χ(G) = 14 , respectively, and the smallest eigenvalue of (the adjacen cy matrix of) Gis equal to
λmin(G) =−3. By Item (b) of Proposition 4(note that the edge-transitivity of Gimplies that
(68) holds with equality), it follows that for all k∈N,
χ(G⊠k)≥/parenleftbigg
1−d
λmin(G)/parenrightbiggk
(84)
= 10k, (85)
which can be compared here to the simple upper and lower bound s onχ(G⊠k)whose values
are given by χ(G)k= 14kandω(G)k= 7k, respectively.
All the factors of the strong products in Examples 6–10are either strongly regular or otherwise,
they are both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive graph s. Consequently, by Item (b) of Propo-
sition 4, the two lower bounds in the right-hand sides of ( 67) and ( 68) coincide. Furthermore,
by Part 2 of Item (d) in Proposition 4, they also offer an improvement over the simple lower
bound that is equal to the product of the clique numbers of eac h factor of the strong product.
The next example shows that such an improvement does not nece ssarily take place if the factors
of the strong product of the regular graphs are not vertex-tr ansitive and edge-transitive, while
also not being strongly regular.
Example 11: LetGbe the Frucht graph, which is 3-regular on 12 vertices (i.e., d= 3 and
n= 12 ). This graph is not strongly regular, and also not vertex-tr ansitive or edge-transitive. The
clique and chromatic numbers of this graph are both equal to 3 (i.e.,ω(G) =χ(G) = 3 ), so
χ(G⊠k) = 3k, k∈N. (86)
The smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of Gis equal to λmin(G) =−2.33866 . By ( 68),
for allk∈N,
χ(G⊠k)≥/parenleftbigg
1−d
λmin(G)/parenrightbiggk
(87)
= 2.28278k. (88)
This shows that the lower bound on the chromatic number in the right-hand side of ( 68) may be
looser than the simple lower bound that is equal to the produc t of the clique numbers of each
factor. This may happen if some of the factors, which are regu lar graphs, are not either strongly
regular, or both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive.26
E. The Shannon capacity of strongly regular graphs
The Lov´ asz θ-function of a strongly regular graph is expressed in closed -form in Corollary 1,
being also an upper bound on the Shannon capacity of such a gra ph [65, Theorem 1]. The
independence number of a graph is, on the other hand, a lower b ound on the Shannon capacity.
The Shannon capacity of such a graph is therefore determined if these upper and lower bounds
coincide. The following examples show such cases of coincid ence for strongly regular graphs.
The ﬁrst one reproduces (in a different way) the Shannon capa city of the Petersen graph, a result
dating back to Lov´ asz [ 65]. The rest of the examples provide new results that determin e the
Shannon capacity of some strongly regular graphs.
Example 12: LetGbe the Petersen graph, whose Shannon capacity is equal to 4. I t is a
special case of [ 65, Theorem 13], which gives the Shannon capacity of Kneser gra phs
Θ/parenleftbig
K(m,r)/parenrightbig
=/parenleftbiggm−1
r−1/parenrightbigg
, m≥2r. (89)
Then, the capacity of the Petersen graph is obtained in [ 65, Corollary 6] by viewing it as an
isomorphic graph to the Kneser graph K(5,2).
As an alternative way to determine its Shannon capacity, the Petersen graph is a strongly
regular graph with parameters srg(10,3,0,1)[19, Section 10.3]. By Corollary 1, it follows that
θ(G) = 4 . This value coincides with the independence number α(G) = 4 , soΘ(G) = 4 .
Example 13: LetGbe the Shrikhande graph, which is strongly regular with the p arameters
srg(16,6,2,2)[19, Section 10.6]. By Corollary 1, it can be veriﬁed that θ(G) = 4 . Its chromatic
number is χ(G) = 4 , and its independence number is α(G) = 4 (soα(G)χ(G) =n, which
implies that the n= 16 vertices in Gare partitioned into four color classes, where each color
class is a largest independent set in Gof size 4). Hence, the graph capacity is equal to Θ(G) = 4 .
The capacity of every graph Gof ordernthat is self-complementary and vertex-transitive is
Θ(G) =√n(see [ 65, Theorem 12]). It should be noted, however, that although th e capacity of
the Shrikhande graph is a case where Θ(G) =√n(withn= 16 ), it does not follow from [ 65,
Theorem 12] since the Shrikhande graph is vertex-transitiv e, but it is notself-complementary.
Example 14: Consider the Hall-Janko graph G, which is strongly regular with parameters
srg(100,36,14,12)[19, Section 10.32]. By Corollary 1,θ(G) = 10 . The independence number
of this graph is α(G) = 10 (this was obtained by the SageMath software [ 85]). Hence, the
Shannon capacity of the Hall-Janko graph is Θ(G) = 10 . This graph is vertex-transitive but it is
not self-complementary so, similarly to Example 13, this result does not follow from the capacity
result in [ 65, Theorem 12] for ﬁnite graphs that are vertex-transitive an d self-complementary.
Example 15: The Hoffman-Singleton graph Gis a strongly regular graph with parameters
srg(50,7,0,1)[19, Section 10.19]. By Corollary 1, it follows that θ(G) = 15 . The independence
number of this graph is α(G) = 15 , so the Shannon capacity of this graph is Θ(G) = 15 .
Example 16: The Schl¨ aﬂi graph Gis strongly regular with parameters srg(27,16,10,8)[19,
Section 10.10]. By Corollary 1, it follows that θ(G) = 3 . The independence number of this
graph isα(G) = 3 , so the Shannon capacity of this graph is Θ(G) = 3 .
Example 17: The Sims-Gewirtz graph Gis strongly regular with parameters srg(56,10,0,2)
(a.k.a. the Gewirtz graph) [ 19, Section 10.20]. By Corollary 1,θ(G) = 16 , and also α(G) = 1627
(it can be veriﬁed by the SageMath software [ 85]). The Shannon capacity of the Sims-Gewirtz
graph is therefore equal to Θ(G) = 16 .
Example 18: TheM22graph (a.k.a. Mesner graph) Gis strongly regular with parameters
srg(77,16,0,4)[19, Section 10.27]. Its independence number is α(G) = 21 , and by Corollary 1
alsoθ(G) = 21 . Consequently, the Shannon capacity of the M22graph isΘ(G) = 21 .
Example 19: The Cameron graph Gis strongly regular with parameters srg(231,30,9,3)(see
[19, Section 10.54]). By Corollary 1,θ(G) = 21 , which coincides with the independence number
ofG, i.e.,α(G) = 21 . The Shannon capacity of the Cameron graph is, hence, equal t oΘ(G) = 21 .
Example 20: Consider the three non-isomorphic Chang graphs. These are s trongly regular
graphs with the same set of parameters srg(28,12,6,4)[19, Section 10.11]. By Corollary 1,
the Lov´ asz θ-function of these graphs is equal to 4, which coincides with their independence
number. The Shannon capacity of each of these three graphs is therefore equal to 4.
Remark 17: Examples 12–20provide several strongly regular graphs for which their Lov ´ asz
θ-function coincides with their independence number, thus d etermining the Shannon capacity of
these graphs. This, however, is not the case in general for st rongly regular graphs. For example,
in continuation to Example 16, the Lov´ asz θ-function of the complement of the Schl¨ aﬂi graph G
(it is a strongly regular graph srg(27,10,1,5)) is equal to θ(G) = 9 . Indeed, θ(G)θ(G) = 27 is
the order of G. It was proved, however, by the rank-bound of Haemers [ 43] that the capacity of
the complement of the Schl¨ aﬂi graph is at most 7. It can be als o veriﬁed that the independence
number of G(i.e., the clique number of the Schl¨ aﬂi graph G) is equal to 6. This overall gives
that6 =ω(G)≤Θ(G)≤7<9 =θ(G).
We end this section by studying some capacity results of afﬁn e polar graphs.
Example 21: Afﬁne polar graphs (see, e.g., [ 19, Section 3.3]) are constructed by considering
a vector space Vof dimension dover a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fqwithqelements, equipped with a non-
degenerate quadratic form Q. The vertices in the graph are represented by the vectors in V, and
any two vectors uandv(i.e., a pair of vertices in the graph) are adjacent if Q(u−v) = 0 .
The resulting graph is denoted by VO+(d,q),VO−(d,q), andVO(d,q)when the quadratic form
Qis hyperbolic, elliptic or parabolic, respectively. In the ﬁrst two cases, dis even, and in the
third case, dis odd; in all cases, qis a positive integral power of a prime number (as it is the
cardinality of the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq). Under these conditions on dandq, the graphs VO+(d,q)and
VO−(d,q)are strongly regular. Let d= 2ewithe∈N. The parameters of G+=VO+(2e,q),
which is a strongly regular graph srg(n+,d+,λ+,µ+), are given by (see [ 19, Section 3.3])
n+=q2e, (90)
d+= (qe−1+1)(qe−1), (91)
λ+=q(qe−2+1)(qe−1−1)+q−2, (92)
µ+=qe−1(qe−1+1), (93)
λ2(G+) =qe−qe−1−1, (94)
λn+(G+) =−qe−1−1, (95)
andG−=VO−(2e,q), a strongly regular graph srg(n−,d−,λ−,µ−), has the parameters
n−=q2e, (96)
d−= (qe−1−1)(qe+1), (97)28
λ−=q(qe−2−1)(qe−1+1)+q−2, (98)
µ−=qe−1(qe−1−1), (99)
λ2(G−) =qe−1−1, (100)
λn−(G−) =−qe+qe−1−1. (101)
By Corollary 1, combined with the parameters (and eigenvalues) in ( 90)–(101), it follows that
θ(G+) =qe=√
n+, (102)
θ(G+) =qe, (103)
θ(G−) =q(qe−qe−1+1), (104)
θ(G−) =q2e−1
qe−qe−1+1. (105)
Consequently, it can be veriﬁed that for some of these afﬁne p olar graphs (with the free
parameters qandeas above), their Lov´ asz θ-function and independence number coincide. (The
numerical computations of the independence numbers of thes e graphs were performed by the
SageMath software [ 85].) This gives, for example, that
Θ/parenleftbig
VO+(4,2)/parenrightbig
= 4,Θ/parenleftbig
VO+(6,2)/parenrightbig
= 8, (106)
Θ/parenleftbig
VO+(4,3)/parenrightbig
= 9,Θ/parenleftbig
VO+(6,3)/parenrightbig
= 27, (107)
as the exact values of the Shannon capacities of these strong ly regular graphs, whose parameters
are, respectively, srg(16,9,4,6),srg(64,35,18,20),srg(81,32,13,12), andsrg(729,260,97,90).
IV. P ROOFS
A. Proofs for Section III-A
1) Proof of Proposition 1:LetGbe ad-regular graph on nvertices. The rightmost inequality
in (24) is provided in [ 65, Theorem 9], together with a sufﬁcient condition that it hol ds with
equality if Gis edge-transitive. Another sufﬁcient condition for that i nequality to hold with
equality is obtained later in this proof.
We ﬁrst prove the leftmost inequality in ( 24), and also obtain sufﬁcient conditions that it holds
with equality. By ( 18) (see [ 65, Corollary 2]),
θ(G)≥n
θ(G)(108)
and, by [ 65, Theorem 8], equality holds in ( 108) ifGis vertex-transitive (or, equivalently, if G
is vertex-transitive). Since Gis an(n−d−1)-regular graph of order n, an application of ( 19)
(see [ 65, Theorem 9]) to Ggives
θ(G)≤ −nλn(G)
(n−d−1)−λn(G), (109)
with equality in ( 109) ifGis edge-transitive. Combining ( 108) and ( 109) gives
θ(G)≥1−n−d−1
λn(G), (110)
with equality in ( 110) ifGis vertex-transitive and edge-transitive (recall that a ve rtex-transitive
graph is regular). By the regularity of G, we have from ( 5),
λn(G) =−1−λ2(G). (111)29
Combining ( 110) and ( 111) gives the leftmost inequality in ( 24), together with the conclusion
that it holds with equality if Gis both vertex-transitive and edge-transitive. Next, ( 25) is obtained
from ( 24) by replacing GwithG(sodis replaced by (n−d−1)sinceGisd-regular, and Gis
(n−d−1)-regular), and by relying on equality ( 111). A sufﬁcient condition that the leftmost
inequality in ( 25) holds with equality is therefore the same condition that th e leftmost inequality
in (24) holds with equality, while replacing GwithG; this means that the leftmost inequality
in (25) holds with equality if Gis vertex-transitive and edge-transitive. Likewise, the r ightmost
inequality in ( 25) holds with equality under the same condition that the right most inequality in
(24) holds with equality, while the graph Gin (24) is replaced by its complement Gin (25). This
means that the rightmost inequality in ( 24) holds with equality if Gis edge-transitive (recall that,
unlike vertex-transitivity that is a property of Gif and only if it is a property of its complement
G, this is not the case for edge-transitivity).
We ﬁnally prove that if Gis a strongly regular graph, then the four inequalities in ( 24) and
(25) hold with equalities. Let Gbe a strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ). Then, the largest,
second-largest, and smallest eigenvalues of Gare given by
λ1(G) =d, (112)
λ2(G) =r/defines1
2/bracketleftBig
λ−µ+/radicalbig
(λ−µ)2+4(d−µ)/bracketrightBig
, (113)
λn(G) =s/defines1
2/bracketleftBig
λ−µ−/radicalbig
(λ−µ)2+4(d−µ)/bracketrightBig
, (114)
wherep1,2in (10) are replaced here with randsin (113) and ( 114), respectively. (Recall that
if the strongly regular graph Gis disconnected, then µ= 0 andλ=d−1by (9), which then
indeed gives that λ2(G) =d=λ1(G)). The substitution of ( 113) and ( 114) into ( 24) and ( 25)
gives
n−d+r
1+r≤θ(G)≤ −ns
d−s, (115)
and
1−d
s≤θ(G)≤n(1+r)
n−d+r. (116)
We show as follows that the rightmost and leftmost terms in ( 115) coincide, turning the two
inequalities in ( 115) into equalities. The coincidence of the rightmost and left most terms in ( 115)
is equivalent to proving the equality
(n−d+r)(d−s)+ns(1+r) = 0. (117)
Indeed, we get
(n−d+r)(d−s)+ns(1+r)
=nd−d2+d(r+s)+(n−1)rs (118)
=nd−d2+d(λ−µ)+(n−1)(µ−d) (119)
=−d(d−λ−1)+µ(n−d−1) (120)
= 0, (121)
where ( 118) and ( 120) hold by straightforward algebra; ( 119) holds by ( 113) and ( 114); (121)
holds by the identity in ( 9).30
The same conclusion also holds for the rightmost and leftmos t terms in ( 116), which can be
shown to coincide if Gis a strongly regular graph, thus turning the two inequaliti es in ( 116) into
equalities. It holds in a similar way to the previous part of t he proof since the complement of a
strongly regular graph is also strongly regular, and the sec ond-largest and smallest eigenvalues of
Gin (115) (i.e., respectively, rands) are replaced in ( 115) by the second-largest and smallest
eigenvalues of G(i.e., respectively, −1−sand−1−r). This proves that each of the four
inequalities in ( 24) and ( 25) holds with equality if Gis a strongly regular graph.
2) Proof of Corollary 1:LetGbe a strongly regular graph srg(n,d,λ,µ). By Proposition 1,
θ(G) =n−d+r
1+r(122)
=−ns
d−s, (123)
and
θ(G) = 1−d
s(124)
=n(1+r)
n−d+r, (125)
whererandsare given in ( 113) and ( 114), respectively. Their substitution into the right-hand
sides of ( 123) and ( 124) gives ( 26) and ( 28), respectively, with the auxiliary parameter tas
deﬁned in ( 29). Equality ( 27) is trivial by ( 122)–(125). This veriﬁes ( 26)–(28) for all strongly
regular graphs.
Since the multiplicities of the distinct eigenvalues of a st rongly regular graph Gare integers,
it follows from ( 11) that if2d+(n−1)(λ−µ)/ne}ationslash= 0, thentin (29) should be an integer. This
implies that, under the latter condition, θ(G)andθ(G)are necessarily rational numbers.
B. Proofs for Section III-B
1) Proof of Corollary 2:LetGbe ad-regular graph of order n, which is non-complete and
also non-empty. Straightforward algebra gives ( 30) by combining the rightmost and leftmost
inequalities in ( 24). Inequalities ( 30) and ( 31) can be veriﬁed to be equivalent by relying on
the inequality d+(n−1)λn(G)<0(this holds since λn(G)≤ −1andd < n−1for a non-
complete and non-empty d-regular graph Gonnvertices). Equality holds in ( 30) if and only if
the rightmost and leftmost terms in ( 24) are equal to θ(G)(i.e., if the two inequalities in ( 24)
are satisﬁed with equalities). According to Item (a) of Prop osition 1, equality holds in ( 30) and
(31) ifGis a strongly regular graph.
We next show that the latter sufﬁcient condition is also nece ssary. To that end, we provide
a second proof that relies on linear algebra. Let A=A(G)andA=A(G)be the adjacency
matrices of GandG, respectively. Let JnandIndenote the n-times-nall-ones and identity
matrices, respectively. Then, by ( 2),A=Jn−In−A. Letjnbe the all-ones n-length column
vector, so jnjT
n=Jn, and
A+c1In+c2Jn= (c1−1)In+(c2+1)Jn−A, (126)31
for allc1,c2∈R. SinceGis ad-regular graph, the largest eigenvalue of Ais equal to dwith
jnas an eigenvector. The vector jnis also an eigenvector of JnandInwith eigenvalues nand
1, respectively. By ( 126), and since Gisd-regular,
(A+c1In+c2Jn)jn=/bracketleftbig
c1−1+n(c2+1)−d/bracketrightbig
jn, (127)
which means that jnis an eigenvector of the matrix A+c1In+c2Jn. The other n−1eigenvectors
of the symmetric matrix A+c1In+c2Jncan be made orthogonal to the eigenvector jn(since
eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix, which correspond to dis tinct eigenvalues, are orthogonal
with respect to the standard inner product in Rn; furthermore, eigenvectors that correspond to
the same eigenvalue can be made orthogonal by the Gram-Schmi dt procedure). Let vbe such
an eigenvector, different from jn. ThenJnv=jn(jT
nv) =0, so by ( 126)
(A+c1In+c2Jn)v= (c1−1)v−Av, (128)
which means that vis also an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix A(since, by assumption, v
is an eigenvector of the matrix A+c1In+c2Jnin the left-hand side of ( 128)). The equality
Av=λvholds, and λ∈ {λ2(G),...,λ n(G)}withλ2(G)being the largest among them. This
gives that λ≤λ2(G). The symmetric matrix A+c1In+c2Jnis positive semi-deﬁnite if and
only if all its eigenvalues are nonnegative, i.e. (see ( 127) and ( 128)),
c1−1+n(c2+1)−d≥0, (129)
c1−1−λ2(G)≥0. (130)
Setting the two conditions in ( 129) and ( 130) to be satisﬁed with equalities gives
c1= 1+λ2(G), c 2=−n−d+λ2(G)
n, (131)
which implies that (see the left-hand side of ( 126))
A+/parenleftbig
1+λ2(G)/parenrightbig
In−/parenleftbiggn−d+λ2(G)

Jn/{ollowsequal0 (132)
is a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix. Clearly, also
A−λn(G)In/{ollowsequal0 (133)
is positive semi-deﬁnite. The trace of a product of two n-times-npositive semi-deﬁnite matrices
is nonnegative, so it follows from ( 132) and ( 133) that
tr/parenleftBigg/parenleftbigg

In−/parenleftbiggn−d+λ2(G)

For an adjacency matrix Aof ad-regular graph G,
tr(AA) = tr(A) = tr(A) = 0, (135)
tr(JnA) =nd, (136)
and
tr(In) = tr(Jn) =n. (137)
By (135)–(137), expanding the left-hand side in ( 134) gives the inequality
−d/parenleftbig
n−d+λ2(G)/parenrightbig
−λn(G)/parenleftbig
d+(n−1)λ2(G)/parenrightbig
≥0, (138)32
which proves ( 30) (we have d+(n−1)λ2(G)>0, by the assumption that the d-regular graph
Gis non-complete and non-empty, so λ2(G)≥0). This alternative proof is next used to ﬁnd the
necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the satisﬁability of (30) with equality. An equality in ( 30)
holds if and only if ( 134) holds with equality (i.e., the trace of the product of the tw o positive
semi-deﬁnite matrices in the left-hand sides of ( 132) and ( 133) is equal to zero). This holds if
and only if the column spaces of the two matrices in the left-h and sides of ( 132) and ( 133) are
orthogonal. [Clariﬁcation: if B,C/{ollowsequal0are positive semi-deﬁnite matrices, then B=SSTand
C=QQTfor some matrices SandQ. Hence, under the assumption that tr(BC) =0,
0 = tr(BC) = tr(SSTQQT) = tr(STQQTS) = tr(STQ(STQ)T) =n/summationdisplay
i=1n/summationdisplay
j=1/parenleftbig
STQ/parenrightbig2
i,j(139)
implies that STQ=0, so alsoBC=S(STQ)QT=0. SinceBandCare symmetric matrices
withBC=0, it means that the column spaces of BandCare orthogonal]. These column
spaces, however, can be orthogonal only if Ahas no eigenvalues other than d,λ2(G)and
λn(G); otherwise, there is a joint eigenvector of Ain the two column spaces of the matrices in
the left-hand sides of ( 132) and ( 133), so these two column spaces cannot be orthogonal in the
latter case. [Clariﬁcation: suppose that Ahas an eigenvector vthat corresponds to an eigenvalue
λ∗/ne}ationslash∈ {d,λ2(G),λn(G)}. Then, by ( 128) and the value of c1in (131), the right-hand side of ( 128)
is equal to (λ2(G)−λ∗)v, and(A−λn(G)In)v= (λ∗−λn(G))v. Both coefﬁcients of vin
these two expressions are nonzero, so vbelongs to the two column spaces of the two matrices in
the left-hand sides of ( 132) and ( 133). These column spaces are therefore not orthogonal under
the assumption of the existence of a distinct eigenvalue λ∗ofA, as above]. We next distinguish
between two cases in regard to the connectivity of the graph G.
(a) If the d-regular graph Gis connected, then λ1(G) =d > λ2(G). By assumption, Gis also
non-complete and non-empty graph, so λ2(G)> λn(G). The connected regular graph Gthus
has exactly three distinct eigenvalues, so it is strongly re gular.
(b) If the d-regular graph Gis disconnected, then λ1(G) =d=λ2(G). If, by assumption,
inequality ( 30) holds with equality, then λn(G) =−1. This means that Gis a disjoint union
of equal-sized complete graphs Kd+1, so it is an imprimitive strongly regular graph (i.e.,
there are no common neighbors of any pair of non-adjacent ver tices inG).
We therefore conclude that, for a non-complete and non-empt yd-regular graph on nvertices,
the condition that Gis strongly regular is also necessary (and not only sufﬁcien t, as it is shown
in the ﬁrst proof) for the inequality in ( 30) to hold with equality. Equivalently, Gbeing strongly
regular is a necessary condition for the inequality in ( 31) to hold with equality. This completes
the proof of the necessity and sufﬁciency of the condition on the strong regularity of G.
2) Proof of Corollary 3:LetGbe ad-regular graph of order n, which is non-complete and
non-empty.
Proof of Item (a) : By the deﬁnition of g2(G)andgn(G)in (32), and in light of the equalities
λn(G) =−1−λ2(G)andλ2(G) =−1−λn(G)(see ( 4)), it can be readily veriﬁed that
the rightmost and leftmost inequalities in ( 33) are equivalent to ( 30) and ( 31), respectively.
Furthermore, in light of Corollary 2, each inequality in ( 33) holds with equality if and only if
Gis strongly regular.33
Proof of Item (b) : LetGbe a strongly regular graph. We next prove the claim about the
dichotomy in the number of distinct values in the sequence {gℓ(G)}n
ℓ=1.
(1) For a d-regular graph on nvertices,λ1(G) =d, andλ1(G) =n−d−1. Substituting these
eigenvalues into ( 32) gives that g1(G) =n−d−2≥0(Gis non-complete, so d≤n−2).
(2) The graph Gand its complement Gare both strongly regular, so each one of them has at
most three distinct eigenvalues.
(3) For a strongly regular graph, by Item (a), g2(G) =−1 =gn(G), andgℓ(G) =−1if either
(i)λℓ(G) =λ2(G)andλℓ(G) =λ2(G), or (ii)λℓ(G) =λn(G)andλℓ(G) =λn(G).
(4) By assumption, Gis a strongly regular graph, which implies that so is G. Due to their
regularity, λ1(G)≥λ2(G), andλ1(G)≥λ2(G)with equalities, respectively, if and only if
GorGare disconnected graphs. The sequence {gℓ(G)}n
ℓ=1gets an additional (third) distinct
value if and only if the multiplicities of the smallest and th e second-largest eigenvalues
ofGin the subsequence (λ2(G),...,λ n(G))are distinct. Indeed, in the latter case, only
one of the following two options is possible: (iii) λℓ(G) =λ2(G)andλℓ(G) =λn(G), or
(iv)λℓ(G) =λn(G)andλℓ(G) =λ2(G). This holds since, by ( 4), the multiplicity of the
second-largest eigenvalue of Gis equal to the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue of G,
and similarly, the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue ofGis equal to the multiplicity of
the second-largest eigenvalue of G. It therefore follows that the third distinct value (as abov e)
is attained by the sequence {gℓ}n
ℓ=1a number of times that is equal to the absolute value of
the difference between the multiplicities of the second-la rgest and the smallest eigenvalues
ofGin the subsequence (λ2(G),...,λ n(G))(provided that the latter two multiplicities are
distinct).
Proof of Item (c) : LetGbe self-complementary and d-regular on nvertices. Then,
d=1
2(n−1), λ2(G) =λ2(G), λn(G) =λn(G). (140)
Combining the rightmost inequality in ( 33) and the equalities in ( 140) readily gives
2λ2(G)2−1
2(n+1)
1+2λ2(G)≥ −1. (141)
SinceGis non-complete and non-empty, we get λ2(G)>0, which then gives from ( 141) the
quadratic inequality
2λ2(G)2+2λ2(G)−1
2(n−1)≥0. (142)
Its solution gives ( 34) (n >1as otherwise, G=K1, butGis by assumption non-complete).
Hence, it also follows that
λn(G) =λn(G) (143)
=−1−λ2(G) (144)
≤ −1−1
2(√n−1) (145)
=−1
2(√n+1), (146)
where ( 143) holds since Gis (by assumption) self-complementary; ( 144) holds by ( 4) sinceG
is regular, and ( 145) holds by ( 34).
Proof of Item (d) : IfGis self-complementary and strongly regular, then in light o f Items (b)
and (c) here, both inequalities in ( 34) and ( 35) hold with equality.34
3) Proof of Corollary 4:Let{Gℓ}ℓ∈Nbe a sequence of regular graphs where Gℓisdℓ-regular
of ordernℓ, such that nℓ→ ∞ anddℓ
nℓ→0as we let ℓtend to inﬁnity. Then,

where ( 147) holds by the leftmost inequality in ( 16); (148) holds by the rightmost inequality in
(25); (149) holds by the assumption that nℓ→ ∞ , and since the eigenvalues of Gℓare bounded
(in absolute value) by dℓwithlim

nℓ= 0. This leads to inequality ( 40), by a ﬂoor operation in
the right-hand side of ( 149), since clique numbers are integers.
We next prove inequality ( 41). For any graph Gonnvertices,
α(G)χ(G)≥n. (150)
(This well-known inequality holds since the independence n umberα(G)denotes the size of a
largest independent set in G, and in coloring the vertices in Gwithχ(G)colors, all color classes
are independent). Additionally, ω(G) =α(G), so
ω(G)χ(G)≥n. (151)

where ( 152) holds by ( 151); (153) is trivial, and ( 154) holds by ( 40).
4) Proof of Corollary 5:Inequalities ( 43) and ( 45) readily follow from Corollary 4since if
{Gℓ}ℓ∈Nis a sequence of Ramanujan d-regular graphs ( dis a ﬁxed degree of the vertices), then
(by deﬁnition)
λ2(Gℓ)≤2√
d−1, (155)
for allℓ∈N. By the assumption that the graph Gℓhas order nℓwithlim
ℓ→∞nℓ=∞, inequalities
(43) and ( 45) are obtained by combining, respectively, ( 40) and ( 41) with ( 155).
Inequality ( 44) is obtained by combining the leftmost inequality in ( 24) with ( 155). Indeed,
since|λ2(Gℓ)| ≤d(where the degree of the vertices of Gℓis, by assumption, equal to a ﬁxed
valued), it follows that
θ(Gℓ)≥nℓ−2d
1+λ2(Gℓ)≥nℓ−2d
1+2√
d−1, (156)
which then yields ( 44).35
5) Proof of Corollary 6:LetGbe a Ramanujan d-regular graph on nvertices. If G=Knis
the complete graph, which is a Ramanujan (n−1)-regular graph if n≥3, then inequality ( 46)
clearly holds with equality (since ω(Kn) =n). Otherwise, if Gis non-complete, then combining
the leftmost inequality in ( 16) and the rightmost inequality in ( 25) gives that
ω(G)≤/floorleftbiggn/parenleftbig
1+λ2(G)/parenrightbig
n−d+λ2(G)/floorrightbigg
, (157)
where the ﬂoor operation in the right-hand side of ( 157) is justiﬁed since ω(G)is an integer. Since
0≤λ2(G)≤2√
d−1is satisﬁed for every Ramanujan d-regular graph Gthat is non-complete,
and since the function f1: (−1,∞)→(0,∞)that is given by
f1(x)/definesn(1+x)
n−d+x, x >−1, (158)
is monotonically increasing, inequality ( 46) then follows from ( 157) and the monotonicity of the
functionf1. Eq. ( 48) follows from ( 46), (151), and since the chromatic number is an integer.
Inequality ( 47) holds with equality if G=Kn(both sides are then equal to 1). Otherwise,
(47) holds by the leftmost inequality in ( 24), since (as mentioned above) 0≤λ2(G)≤2√
d−1
is satisﬁed for every Ramanujan d-regular graph Gthat is non-complete, and since the function
f2: (−1,∞)→(0,∞)that is given by
f2(x)/definesn−d+x
1+x, x >−1, (159)
is monotonically decreasing.
C. Proofs for Section III-C
1) Proof of Proposition 2:LetG1,...,Gkbe regular graphs such that, for all ℓ∈[k], the
graphGℓisdℓ-regular on nℓvertices. Let G=G1⊠...⊠Gkbe the strong product of these k
regular graphs. We next prove the two items of Proposition 2.
(a) By the leftmost inequality in ( 24), unless G=Kn,
θ(G)≥n(G)−d(G)+λ2(G)
1+λ2(G), (160)
wheren(G)andd(G)denote, respectively, the order and valency of the strong pr oduct, which
is a regular graph (since, by assumption, each factor is regu lar). The following equalities
hold as a result of the strong product operation:
n(G) =k/productdisplay
ℓ=1nℓ, (161)
d(G) =k/productdisplay
ℓ=1(1+dℓ)−1, (162)
θ(G) =k/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ). (163)
Indeed, equality ( 161) holds since the cardinality of a Cartesian product of ﬁnite sets is
equal to the product of the cardinalities of each set; equali ty (162) can be justiﬁed by ﬁrst36
verifying the special case of a strong product of two regular graphs, and then proceeding by
a mathematical induction on k. Finally, equality ( 163) holds by ( 17) (see [ 65, Theorem 7]).
Combining the bound in ( 160) with equalities ( 161)–(163) gives
k/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ)≥1+k/producttext
ℓ=1nℓ−k/producttext
ℓ=1(1+dℓ)
1+λ2(G). (164)
Unless all Gℓ(withℓ∈[k]) are complete graphs, the left-hand side of ( 164) is strictly larger
than 1, and then rearrangement of the terms in ( 164) gives the lower bound on λ2(G)in (52).
Next, the possible loosening of the lower bound in the right- hand side of ( 52) to the lower
bound in the right-hand side of ( 53) holds by ( 19) (see [ 65, Theorem 9]). Inequality ( 53)
holds with equality if each regular factor Gℓis either edge-transitive (by [ 65, Theorem 9])
or strongly regular (by Item (a) of Proposition 1).
(b) Combining ( 19) with equalities ( 161)–(163) gives, with n=n(G)andd=d(G),
k/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ) =θ(G) (165)
≤ −nλn(G)
d−λn(G)(166)
=−k/producttext
ℓ=1nℓ·λn(G)
k/producttext
ℓ=1(1+dℓ)−1−λn(G). (167)
Unless all Gℓ(withℓ∈[k]) are empty graphs, the denominator in the right-hand side of
(167) is strictly positive. This gives ( 54) after rearrangement of terms. Finally, the transition
from ( 54) to ( 55) is justiﬁed if
θ(Gℓ) =−nℓλmin(Gℓ)
dℓ−λmin(Gℓ),∀ℓ∈[k]. (168)
As above (the end of the proof of Item (a)), the condition in ( 168) holds if the regular graph
Gℓis either edge-transitive or strongly regular.
2) Proof of Corollary 7:LetGad-regular graph of order n. The lower bound on the second-
largest eigenvalue λ2(G⊠k)in the right-hand side of ( 59) follows from ( 52) by setting there
G1,...,Gkto be all identical to G. The upper bound on the smallest eigenvalue λmin(G⊠k)in
the right-hand side of ( 60) follows in a similar way from ( 54).
3) Proof of Proposition 3:LetGbe a connected d-regular graph on nvertices, which is
non-empty and non-complete, and let k∈N. Then,G⊠kis a connected regular graph, which is
non-complete and non-empty (so, its largest eigenvalue is o f multiplicity 1). By ( 59),
λ2(G⊠k)≥nk−(1+d)k
θ(G)k−1−1. (169)
In order to prove that the k-fold strong power G⊠kis non-Ramanujan, it is sufﬁcient to show
that the lower bound on its second-largest eigenvalue in the right-hand side of ( 169) is larger37
than2√dk−1(see the right-hand side of ( 7)); here,dk= (1+d)k−1is the valency of the
strong power G⊠k. SinceGisd-regular and non-complete (i.e., d < n−1andθ(G)>1), the
right-hand side of ( 169) scales asymptotically like/parenleftBig
n
θ(G)/parenrightBigk
(for a sufﬁciently large k), whereas
the expression 2√dk−1scales asymptotically like 2(1+d)k
2. Comparing these two exponents
gives that if
θ(G)<n√
1+d, (170)
then the exponential growth rate (in k) of the right-hand side of ( 169) is larger than that one of
2√dk−1. Hence, for sufﬁciently large k, the strong power G⊠kis a (highly) non-Ramanujan
graph under the condition in ( 170). This means that there exists k0∈Nsuch that the strong
powerG⊠kis non-Ramanujan for all k≥k0. We next obtain an explicit value of such k0, which
is not necessarily the smallest one, proving that such a vali d value for k0is given by ( 63). To
that end, based on the above explanation, one needs to deal wi th the inequality
nk−(1+d)k
θ(G)k−1−1>2/radicalBig
(1+d)k−2. (171)
In order to obtain a closed-form solution, we strengthen the condition in ( 171) to
nk−(1+d)k
θ(G)k−1≥2(1+d)k

Dividing both sides of ( 172) by(1+d)k

2, (176)
withk≥3. Solving inequality ( 176) implies that inequality ( 171) is satisﬁed for all k≥k0,
with the closed-form expression of k0in (63). It therefore gives that if Gis ad-regular graph
onnvertices, which satisﬁes the condition in ( 170), thenG⊠kis non-Ramanujan for all k≥k0
(it becomes, in fact, a highly non-Ramanujan graph since bot h sides of inequality ( 171) have
different exponential growth rates in k, so the condition for a Ramanujan graph is sharply
violated for the strong power G⊠kwhen the value of kis increased).38
We next specialize this result for graphs that are self-comp lementary and vertex-transitive. For
n= 1, the complete graph G=K1is a self-complementary and vertex-transitive graph, whos e
all strong powers are also isomorphic to K1, so they are therefore non-Ramanujan graphs.
LetGbe a graph of order n >1that is self-complementary and vertex-transitive, so it is
d-regular with d=1
2(n−1). Additionally, for such a graph G, the Lov´ asz θ-function is equal
toθ(G) =√n, and it coincides with the Shannon capacity of G(see [ 65, Theorems 8 and 12]).
Then,

so the condition in ( 62) is fulﬁlled by graphs of order nthat are self-complementary and vertex-

D. Proofs for Section III-D
1) Proof of Proposition 4:
(a) LetG1,...,Gkbeksimple, ﬁnite and undirected graphs,/vextendsingle/vextendsingleV(Gℓ)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=nℓforℓ∈[k], and let
G=G1⊠...⊠Gk. We provide two alternative simple proofs of ( 65).
First proof:
χ(G)≥θ(G) (180)
≥|V(G)|
θ(G)(181)
=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1|V(Gℓ)|
θ(Gℓ), (182)
where ( 180) holds by ( 16), (181) holds by ( 18), and equality ( 182) holds by ( 17) and since
V(G) =V(G1)×...×V(Gk). The ceiling operation can be add to the right-hand side of
(182) since a chromatic number is an integer.
Second proof:
χ(G)≥|V(G)|
α(G)(183)
≥|V(G)|
θ(G)(184)
=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1|V(Gℓ)|
θ(Gℓ), (185)39
where ( 183) holds by ( 150), (184) holds by ( 23), and ( 185) is ( 182).
We next prove ( 66).
χ(G)≥θ(G) (186)
=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ), (187)
where ( 186) holds by ( 15), and ( 187) holds by ( 17).
(b) LetG1,...,Gkbe regular graphs, where Gℓisdℓ-regular of order nℓfor allℓ∈[k].
Inequality ( 67) is ( 65). Inequality ( 68) follows from ( 19) and ( 67). Furthermore, by Item (a)
in Proposition 1, inequality ( 68) holds with equality if each regular graph Gℓ, forℓ∈[k], is
either edge-transitive or strongly regular.
(c) By ( 182), with|V(Gℓ)|=nℓ,
|V(G)|
θ(G)=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1nℓ
θ(Gℓ). (188)
Suppose that, for all ℓ∈[k],Gℓisdℓ-regular, and it is also either edge-transitive or strongly
regular. By Item (a) in Proposition 1, for allℓ∈[k],
θ(Gℓ) =−nℓλmin(Gℓ)
dℓ−λmin(Gℓ). (189)
Combining ( 188) and ( 189) gives
|V(G)|
θ(G)=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1/parenleftbigg
1−dℓ
λmin(Gℓ)/parenrightbigg
. (190)
On the other hand, since G=G1⊠...⊠Gℓisd-regular, with d/definesd(G)as given in ( 70), it
follows from ( 19) that
θ(G)≤ −|V(G)|λmin(G)
d(G)−λmin(G). (191)
It should be noted, in regard to ( 191), that even if all Gℓ’s are regular and edge-transitive
graphs, their strong product Gis not necessarily edge-transitive. In fact, Gis not edge-
transitive, unless all the kfactors{Gℓ}k
ℓ=1are complete graphs (see [ 47, Theorem 3.1]).
For this reason, ( 191) does not hold in general with equality (see [ 65, Theorem 9]). Finally,
combing ( 190) and ( 191) gives inequality ( 69).
(d) LetG1,...,Gkbe regular graphs, where Gℓisdℓ-regular on nℓvertices for all ℓ∈[k]. Then,
under the assumptions of Item (d),
(1)
k/productdisplay
ℓ=1|V(Gℓ)|
θ(Gℓ)=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ) (192)
≥k/productdisplay
ℓ=1ω(Gℓ) (193)
where ( 192) holds since, by assumption, each of the graphs G1,...,Gkis vertex-
transitive or a strongly regular graph (this is because [ 65, Theorem 8] and ( 27) provide40
different sufﬁcient conditions for inequality ( 18) to hold with equality). Inequality ( 193)
holds by the leftmost inequality in ( 16).
(2)
k/productdisplay
ℓ=1/parenleftbigg
1−dℓ
λmin(Gℓ)/parenrightbigg
=k/productdisplay
ℓ=1|V(Gℓ)|
θ(Gℓ)(194)
≥k/productdisplay
ℓ=1ω(Gℓ) (195)
where, by Item (a) of Proposition 1, equality ( 194) holds since (by assumption), for all
ℓ∈[k], the graph Gℓis either regular and edge-transitive, or a strongly regula r graph.
Inequality ( 195) holds under the same reasoning as of ( 192) and ( 193).
To summarize, it shows that under proper assumptions, the lo wer bound on the chromatic
number of Gin the right-hand side of ( 65), or even its loosened bound in the right-hand
side of ( 68), are larger than or equal to the lower boundk/producttext
ℓ=1ω(Gℓ).
(e) By ( 66),
χ(G)≥k/productdisplay
ℓ=1θ(Gℓ). (196)
Let, for all ℓ∈[k], the graph Gℓbedℓ-regular on nℓvertices, and suppose that it is either
edge-transitive or strongly regular. Then, by Item (a) of Pr oposition 1,
θ(Gℓ) =−nℓλmin(Gℓ)
dℓ−λmin(Gℓ),∀ℓ∈[k]. (197)
Combining ( 196) and ( 197), followed by taking a ceiling operation on the lower bound o n
the chromatic number χ(G), gives ( 71).
(f) By the assumption that G1,...,Gkare self-complementary,
θ(Gℓ) =θ(Gℓ),∀ℓ∈[k]. (198)
Furthermore, by the assumption that for all ℓ∈[k],Gℓis a graph on nℓvertices that is
either vertex-transitive or strongly regular,
θ(Gℓ)θ(Gℓ) =nℓ,∀ℓ∈[k]. (199)
Combining ( 198) and ( 199) gives
θ(Gℓ) =√nℓ,∀ℓ∈[k]. (200)
Consequently, by ( 65) and ( 200),
χ(G)≥/ceilingleftBiggk/productdisplay
ℓ=1nℓ
θ(Gℓ)/ceilingrightBigg
(201)
=/ceilingleftBigk/productdisplay
ℓ=1√nℓ/ceilingrightBig

(204)
=/ceilingleftBigk/productdisplay
ℓ=1√nℓ/ceilingrightBig
(205)
=/ceilingleftbig√n/ceilingrightbig
. (206)
This proves ( 72) and ( 73), and it completes the proof of Proposition 4.
2) Proof of Corollary 8:The rightmost inequality in ( 78) is a well-known upper bound on
the chromatic number of strong products (see [ 11], [15, Theorem 3]). The leftmost inequality
in (78) gives a lower bound on the chromatic number of a strong produ ct of (not necessarily
distinct) non-complete, and strongly regular graphs. It re adily follows by combining equality ( 26)
in Corollary 1, together with inequality ( 65) in Proposition 4. Finally, by Part 1 of Item (d) in
Proposition 4, the leftmost term in ( 78) is larger than or equal to the product of the clique
numbers of {Gℓ}k
ℓ=1.
