A perfect Kagome lattice features ﬂat bands that usually lead to strong electronic correlation
eﬀects, but how electronic correlation, in turn, stabilizes a perfect Kagome lattice has rarely been
explored. Here, we study such eﬀect in a superconducting ( Tc∼7.8 K) Kagome metal LaRu 3Si2with
a distorted Kagome plane consisting of pure Ru ions, using density functional theory plus Uand plus
dynamical mean-ﬁeld theory. We ﬁnd that increasing electronic correlation can stabilize a perfect
Kagome lattice and induce substantial ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations in LaRu 3Si2. By comparing the
calculated magnetic susceptibilities to experimental data, LaRu 3Si2is found to be on the verge of
becoming a perfect Kagome lattice. It thus shows moderate but non-negligible electronic correlations
and ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations, which are crucial to understanding the experimentally observed non-
Fermi-liquid behavior and the pretty high superconducting Tcof LaRu 3Si2.

I. INTRODUCTION
A perfect Kagome lattice features ﬂat bands due to
the destructive interference of electron hoppings within
the geometrically frustrated structure1–5. When ﬂat
bands are near the Fermi level, it usually induces strong
electronic correlation eﬀects such as unconventional su-
perconductivity6–11, magnetism2,3, topological phases5
and exotic charge density waves12,13. In recent years,
these ﬂat-bands-induced correlation eﬀects have been
widely studied in Kagome metals, for example, FeSn14,15,
FeGe13,16, Fe 3Sn217–19, CoSn20–24, RT 6Ge6(R=rare-
earth elements, T=Mn, Cr)25,26. But how electronic cor-
relation, in turn, stabilizes a perfect Kagome lattice has
rarely been explored. Here, we study such eﬀect in a
Kagome metal LaRu 3Si227–31, using density functional
theory (DFT) plus U32and plus dynamical mean-ﬁeld
theory (DMFT)33–35.
LaRu 3Si2is a superconductor with a highest Tc∼7.8
K27among the known Kagome superconductors at am-
bient conditions. It is a paramagnetic metal at high-
temperate. Non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior was in-
ferred from transport experiments, indicating substantial
electronic correlations from Ru-4 dorbitals29. A recent
DFT calculation based on the electron-phonon coupling
mechanism yields a Tc∼1.2 K, much smaller than the
experimental value30, also indicating other factors such
as electronic correlations and magnetic ﬂuctuations must
be considered to understand its superconductivity.
The perfect Kagome structure of LaRu 3Si2with space
group P6/mmm is shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(c). The
Kagome layer consists of pure Ru atoms, diﬀerent from
most other Kagome materials in which an anion usually
resides in the center of the hexagon of the Kagome struc-
ture. Adjacent to the Kagome layer is a layer consisting
of a triangular lattice of La and a honeycomb lattice of Si.
However, a previous X-Ray diﬀraction study shows that
LaRu 3Si2, in reality, crystallizes into a slightly distorted

space group P6 3/m27(see Fig. 1(b) and 1(e)). Given
only one kind of ion (Ru) present in the Kagome layer of
LaRu 3Si2, it provides an ideal platform for studying its
electronic correlation eﬀects on stabilizing a perfect Ru
Kagome lattice, since it rules out possible crystalline ﬁeld
eﬀects of anion on the stability of the Kagome lattice.
Our calculations ﬁnd that increasing electronic corre-
lation can stabilize a perfect Kagome lattice and induce
substantial ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations in LaRu 3Si2. ByarXiv:2303.12273v1  [cond-mat.str-el]  22 Mar 20232
comparing the calculated magnetic susceptibilities to ex-
perimental data, LaRu 3Si2is found to be on the verge
of the transition from a distorted to a perfect Kagome
lattice. It thus shows moderate but non-negligible elec-
tronic correlations and ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations, con-
sistent with the experimentally observed NFL behav-
ior29. Furthermore, our calculations show that the dis-
torted Kagome structure of LaRu 3Si2may hold higher
symmetry (space group P6 3/mcm, see Fig. 1(d)) than
that reported by previous experiment (P6 3/m)27, which
should be further examined by high-resolution crystal
structure reﬁnement with high-quality samples.
II. METHODS
We perform DFT+U calculations using the VASP
package37,38, with exchange-correlation functional of
both local density approximation (LDA) and general-
ized gradient approximation (GGA)39. The energy cutoﬀ
of the plane-wave basis is set to be 500 eV, and a Γ-
centered 21×21×21 K-point grid is used. The internal
atomic positions are relaxed in the non-magnetic states,
until the force of each atom is smaller than 1 meV/ ˚A.
The rotationally invariant DFT+U method introduced
by Liechtenstein et al.40is used, which is parameterized
by Hubbard Uand Hund’s coupling JH(LDAUTYPE=1
or 4). It turns out that the spin-orbital coupling (SOC)
of Ru would not change the main conclusions, so we only
present the non-SOC results in the main text, and a SOC
result is presented in the Supporting Information (Fig.
S1)41. The energies of two magnetic orders, ferromag-
netic (FM) and A-type anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) (Fig.
S2)41, are also calculated by GGA+U.
We also perform fully charge self-consistent
LDA+DMFT calculations in the paramagnetic states of
LaRu 3Si2, using the code EDMFTF developed by Haule
et al.42,43based on the WIEN2K package44. We choose
a wide hybridization energy window from -10 to 10 eV
with respect to the Fermi level. All ﬁve Ru-4 dorbitals
are considered as correlated ones and a local Coulomb
interaction Hamiltonian with rotationally invariant form
is applied. The local Anderson impurity model is solved
by the continuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC)
solver45. We use an “exact” double counting scheme
invented by Haule46. The self-energy on real frequency
Σ(ω) is obtained by the analytical continuation method
of maximum entropy. We follow the method introduced
by Haule et al.47to perform structure relaxation in
the framework of LDA+DMFT. All the calculations
are preformed at T= 290 K. Following Ref.43, we use
the Yukawa representation of the screened Coulomb
interaction, in which there is an unique relationship
betweenUandJH. IfUis speciﬁed, JHis uniquely
determined by a code in EDMFTF48. Their values are
tabulated in the Supporting Information (Table S1)41
and are also used for the DFT+U calculations.

stabilizing a perfect Kagome lattice in LaRu 3Si2, (1) we
vary the Hubbard Ufrom 0 to 6 eV in our calculation;
(2) we perform a comparative study on a hypothetical
crystal structure LaFe 3Si2with the same lattice parame-
ters and initial atomic positions as LaRu 3Si2, since Fe-3d
orbitals are expected to show stronger electronic correla-
tions than Ru-4 dorbitals. To uncover how the adjacent
LaSi 2layers aﬀect the stability of the Ru 3Kagome layer,
we also perform comparative calculations by varying the
lattice parameter ratio c/awith the ﬁxed crystal volume
from experiment. The experimental lattice parameters
area= 5.676˚A,c= 7.12˚A, which gives a volume of
198.65 ˚A327. Crystal structure with space group P6 3/m
and Ru sites at ( x= 0.52,y= 0.01,z= 0.25) is con-
structed as the starting point for relaxation (see Fig. 1(b)
and 1(e)). However, all the relaxations converge to the
higher symmetry structure with space group P6 3/mcm3
(x/negationslash= 0.5,y= 0,z= 0.25), where an additional C2and
mirror symmetry is present (see Fig. 1(d)). Therefore,
we will only discuss the results of space group P6 3/mcm
below.
III. RESULTS
Fig. 2(a)-(b) and (d)-(e) show the fractional coordi-
natexof Ru (Fe) relaxed by LDA+U, GGA+U and
LDA+DMFT methods, for diﬀerent c/a ratio. For
LaRu 3Si2, as increasing U, all the methods yield a ten-
dency thatxis decreasing and approaching to the value of
a perfect Kagome lattice (= 0 .5). We note that LaFe 3Si2
converges to the perfect Kagome structure even at U= 0.
Comparing to LDA+U, the GGA+U method that is ex-
pected to better describe the correlation eﬀects, gives
smallerx(dashed curves in Fig. 2(a)). Fig. 2(c) and
(f) show the LDA+DMFT calculated orbital-resolved
quasi-particle mass-enhancement, m⋆/mDFT= 1/Z, due
to the electronic correlation eﬀects, where Zis quasi-
particle weight. The system is more correlated as 1 /Z
deviates more from 1. The electronic correlation be-
come stronger as increasing U, and LaFe 3Si2shows much
stronger correlation than LaRu 3Si2as expected. The
most correlated orbital is dx2−y2which contributes to
the ﬂat bands near the Fermi level (see below). There-
fore, these results indicate that strong electronic correla-
tion would stabilize a perfect Kagome lattice consisting
of transition metal ions in the system of LaX 3Si2(X=Ru,
Fe).
Fig. 2(a)-(b) also show that increasing the lattice pa-
rameter ratio c/a, i.e., longer distance between the Ru 3
Kagome layer and LaSi 2layer, tends to increase xand
distort the Kagome plane. Thus, larger Hubbard Uis
required to stabilize a perfect Kagome lattice at larger
ratio ofc/a.
Fig. 3(a) and (d) show the local magnetic suscepti-
bilitiesχloc(T) calculated by LDA+DMFT for diﬀerent
U. For LaRu 3Si2,χloc(T) shows Pauli paramagnetism
behavior at U= 3 eV, while it shows a Curie-Weiss-
like behavior at U= 5 eV. In between, χloc(T) slightly
increases as decreasing temperate, which is consistent
with that measured by experiment (see Fig.7 in Ref.29).
Based on this, we infer that the actual Hubbard Ufor
LaRu 3Si2is about 4 eV. At this Uvalue, LaRu 3Si2is
thus found to be on the verge of crystallizing into a per-
fect Kagome structure, according to the relaxation re-
sults at the experimental lattice parameters shown as
the orange curves in Fig. 2(a),(b). At U= 4 eV, the
mass-enhancement of the most correlated orbital dx2−y2
is about 1.63 (Fig. 2(c)). This indicates a moderate elec-
tronic correlation in LaRu 3Si2, consistent with a slightly
large Wilson ratio R= 2.88 (R= 1 for non-interacting
electron gas) and a NFL contribution to the electronic
speciﬁc heat, found by the transport experiment29. In
contrast,χloc(T) shows a well-deﬁned Curie-Weiss be-
havior for LaFe 3Si2, indicating much stronger electronic

Fig. 3(b) and (e) show the energies of the FM and AFM
orders with respect to the non-magnetic phase calculated
by GGA+U, and Fig. 3(c) and (f) show the correspond-
ing ordered magnetic moments. LaFe 3Si2has very low
energies in magnetic states compared to its non-magnetic
state and large ordered magnetic moments, suggesting
that it tends to order as decreasing temperature. Its
FM and AFM states are very close in energies, indi-
cating comparable inter-layer FM and AFM couplings.
LaRu 3Si2shows much weaker magnetism compared to
LaFe 3Si2, but the FM and AFM states are still found to
be energetically stable at the static mean-ﬁeld level. Its
FM state has signiﬁcantly lower energy than the AFM
state. Although no magnetic orders have been observed
experimentally in LaRu 3Si2, the stable FM state found
by GGA+U calculation suggests that substantial FM
ﬂuctuations may exist in LaRu 3Si2. Such FM ﬂuctu-
ations should be attributed to the ﬂat bands near the
Fermi level, derived from the Kagome lattice.

eV andJH= 0.782 eV in the paramagnetic states. Ex-
tremely ﬂat bands with dx2−y2characters clearly exist
near the Fermi level in LaFe 3Si2. However, such bands
in LaRu 3Si2are not as ﬂat as that in LaFe 3Si2. By com-
paring the band structures between the distorted and
perfect Kagome lattice of LaRu 3Si2, we found that the
magnitude of distortion of the Kagome lattice have small
eﬀects on the ﬂat bands in LaRu 3Si2. Actually, it is
mainly caused by the more extended 4 dorbitals that will
induce non-vanishing hoppings among distant Kagome
lattice sites and result in imperfect destructive interfer-
ence of hoppings. In LaRu 3Si2, the ﬂat bands would in-
duce substantial FM ﬂuctuations, as shown in Fig. 3(b).
IV. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
To summarize, by taking the Kagome system LaX 3Si2
(X=Ru, Fe) as an example, we have demonstrated that
strong electronic correlations could play important roles
in stabilizing a perfect Kagome plane. We show that
LaRu 3Si2is on the verge of becoming a perfect Kagome
lattice and it thus exhibits moderate electronic correla-
tion and substantial ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations. Previ-
ous study has shown that the electron-phonon couplingsalone are not nearly enough to account for a supercon-
ductingTcof 7.8 K in LaRu 3Si230. The electronic corre-
lations and ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations found in our study
may play signiﬁcant roles in enhancing Tcof LaRu 3Si2,
which is worthy of further study.
As shown in the Fig. S3 in the Supporting Informa-
tion41, the only obvious diﬀerence in the simulated pow-
der diﬀraction pattern of LaRu 3Si2between the space
group P6 3/mcm and P6 3/m is an additional reﬂection at
(1 0 1) for P6 3/m. However, its intensity is very weak
compared to the main peak such that it is very diﬃcult
to be resolved experimentally. Further high-resolution
crystal structure reﬁnement with high-quality sample is
required to determine whether LaRu 3Si2crystallizes into
the space group P6 3/mcm or not. Our result thus pro-
vides a reference for the crystal structure reﬁnement of
LaRu 3Si2.
