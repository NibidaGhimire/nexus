We propose an e fficient circuit structure of variational quantum circuit Ans¨ atze used for the variational quan-
tum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in calculating gapped topological phases on the currently feasible noisy
intermediate-scale quantum computers. An e fficient circuit Ansatz should include two layers: the initialization
layer and the variational layer. In the initialization layer, a fixed depth circuit state with a compatible entangle-
ment structure to the target topological phase is constructed. The circuit state is further adjusted subsequently to
capture the details of the local correlations, which is dictated with the Hamiltonian, in the parametrized varia-
tional layer. Based on this strategy, we design a circuit Ansatz to investigate the symmetry-protected topological
Haldane phase in a non-exactly solvable alternating spin-1 /2 Heisenberg chain by VQE calculations. Main
characterizations of the Haldane phase, including the long-ranged string order, the four-fold nearly degenerate
ground states associated with four di fferent localized edge mode patterns for the system with open boundaries,
and the two-fold degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum, are all observed for the optimized shallow circuit
state with only one depth variational layer both in numerical simulations and on real quantum computers. We
further demonstrate that the computational capacity (i.e., expressibility) of this quantum circuit Ansatz is deter-
mined not by the system size but only by the intrinsic correlation length of the system, thus implying that the
scalable VQE calculation is possible.
I. INTRODUCTION
Exploring exotic phenomena that emerge in quantum
many-body systems is one of the prominent issues in modern
condensed matter physics. However, because of its exponen-
tially increased complexity, one still lacks an e fficient theo-
retical tool to investigate these systems in general. Quantum
simulation [1], which has been proposed for a long time [2],
provide a promising solution by realizing them in control-
lable synthetic quantum systems and exploring their proper-
ties. Nevertheless, realizing such a well-controlled artificial
quantum device is also an extremely challenging task [3].
Recently, quantum simulation has attracted increasing in-
terest since the successful realization of the analog quantum
simulators in cold atom systems [4–6] and the digital quan-
tum simulators using programmable superconducting tran-
somons [7] and trapped ions [8]. Specially, the latter ones,
i.e., circuit-based quantum computers, have received particu-
lar attention because of their flexibility to universal quantum
computing, although a generic quantum circuit with any depth
cannot be evolved with high fidelity on the current implemen-
tation, hence regarded as the noisy intermediate-scale quan-
tum (NISQ) device [9]. On the other hand, the algorithms
suitable for the NISQ device, which usually involves shallow
circuits, are currently under investigation [10].
Many interesting phases of matter have been realized on the
NISQ device, such as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT)
phase [11, 12] and a topological quantum spin liquid [13],
byprecisely constructing these states in shallow quantum cir-
cuits. These exact circuit states usually correspond to some
exquisitely exactly solvable Hamiltonians, such as the cluster
model [14] (realized in Refs. [11, 12]) and the Kitaev toric
code model [15] (realized in Ref. [13]). However, it is usuallyimpossible to obtain the exact solution of a more generic and
realistic many-body Hamiltonian.
Generally, a quantum many-body state, considered as the
ground state of some complex Hamiltonian, can be pre-
pared on the circuit-based quantum computer by performing
digitized adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) process [16–
18] (for a review, see Ref. [19]), which is also known as
quantum annealing (QA) [20] or adiabatic state preparation
(ASP) [21]. However, the AQC usually requires deep circuits,
thus challenging for the present NISQ device. Following the
same spirit of the quantum approximate optimization algo-
rithm [22], the quantum adiabatic path itself can be optimized
variationally to obtain the desired state with a relatively shal-
low circuit [23–27], and various auxiliary techniques such as
circuit recompiling [28, 29] and counterdiabatic driving [30–
33] have also been proposed.
Apart from preparing a certain quantum state, we can di-
rectly evaluate the ground state of the desired quantum many-
body Hamiltonian Hby solving the related eigenvalue prob-
lem on the NISQ device. One of the most extensively studied
algorithms for this purpose is the variational quantum eigen-
solver (VQE) [34–36]. In the VQE scheme, a variational
circuit Ansatz|Ψ(θ)⟩parametrized with the variational pa-
rameters θ=(θ1,θ2,θ3,...) is evolved on a quantum com-
puter to estimate the associated variational energy E(θ)=
⟨Ψ(θ)|H|Ψ(θ)⟩as a cost function (for a considerable system, it
is almost unattainable on a classical computer), and the varia-
tional parameters θare updated on a classical computer. This
quantum-classical loop is repeated until the variational pa-
rameters θconverge so as to minimize the variational energy
E(θ). The resulting|Ψ(θ∗)⟩with the optimized variational pa-
rameters θ∗can be considered as a good approximation for
the ground state of H.arXiv:2303.17187v2  [quant-ph]  18 Aug 20232
In principle, the VQE scheme asserts to solve the ground
state (as well as excited states) for any quantum many-body
Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, the practical applications are still
questioned. One of the main issues is how to design the varia-
tional circuit Ansatz that can be evolved on the present NISQ
device with high fidelity. High fidelity implies that the circuit
should be designed with a shallow depth. However, the cir-
cuit depth usually diverges with the problem size in the circuit
Ansatz currently applied widely, such as quantum alternating
operator Ansatz [37], which is also inspired by the Trotterized
quantum adiabatic transformation.
Here, we propose an e fficient variational quantum circuit
structure for the VQE calculations of the ground state in a
gapped topological phase. The e fficient variational quan-
tum circuit consists of an initialization layer where the ba-
sic entanglement structure of the targeted topological phase is
built, followed by a variational layer which is adapted to fit
the model-parameter-specific fine correlation structure of the
ground state. We employ this Ansatz strategy to explore the
SPT Haldane phase in a realistic, not exactly solvable model,
i.e., an alternating Heisenberg chain (AHC). We demonstrate
that a nearly exact ground state can be obtained by a very shal-
low parametrized circuit Ansatz in a finite range of the model
parameter space. Furthermore, the four-fold nearly degenerate
ground states associated with di fferent edge mode patterns are
obtained in the circuit states by specifying the initializations at
the edges of the system. By implementing these circuit states
on IBM quantum computers, we reveal that all the character-
istic features of the SPT Haldane phase, including the string
order parameter, edge modes, and two-fold degenerate entan-
glement spectrum, can be clearly observed on the real devices.
Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that (i) a deeper vari-
ational layer is necessary if the entanglement structure is not
correctly set up in the initialization layer and (ii) the computa-
tional capacity of an appropriately constructed circuit Ansatz
is determined by the correlation length of the system, not by
the system size. Finally, we discuss that this circuit Ansatz has
the potential to achieve the quantum advantage on the current
NISQ device.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first briefly
summarize the relation between quantum entanglement and
a topological phase, and propose an e fficient variational cir-
cuit structure in Sec. II. Next, we introduce the AHC model,
which is a realization of the SPT Haldane phase in a spin-
1/2 system, and summarize the main characterizations of the
SPT Haldane phase in Sec. III. In Sec. IV, we develop a spe-
cific variational circuit Ansatz for the VQE calculations of the
AHC model and examine its symmetry properties. We also
explain briefly the VQE scheme employed in this study, in-
cluding the optimization method and the parameter setup. In
Sec. V, using both numerical simulations and real quantum
devices, we characterize the features of the VQE optimized
circuit states. In Sec. VI, we discuss expressibility of the cir-
cuitAnsatz . Finally, we conclude this paper by summarizing
our results, and discuss several further extensions and the rele-
vance to the quantum advantage. Degeneracy of entanglement
spectrum of the parametrized circuit states introduced in this
study is further examined in Appendix A. The circuit Ansatzdepth dependence of the string order in the VQE simulations
of the SPT Haldane phase is discussed in Appendix B, and
the comparison with a generic circuit Ansatz without elabo-
rate structures is also provided in Appendix C.
II. EFFICIENT VARIATIONAL CIRCUIT STRUCTURE
A. Quantum entanglement and topological phase
Exotic quantum phases, which cannot be described by the
Landau’s symmetry-breaking paradigm and are not character-
ized by local order parameters, are usually considered to hold
topological orders [38, 39]. One of the primary characteris-
tics of a topological phase is the nontrivial quantum entan-
glement structure, which distinguishes it from a trivial direct-
product state [40]. The nontrivial entanglement structure im-
plies that it cannot be easily disentangled to a direct-product
state by local unitary transformations. Therefore, the intrinsic
(symmetry-protected) topological phase can be defined, in an
operational way, as a state that cannot be connected to a direct-
product state by any (certain symmetric) finite-depth quantum
circuit composed of local gates in the thermodynamic limit.
On the other hand, two states can be connected by a quantum
circuit with finite depth in the thermodynamic limit when they
are in the same topological phase [41].
Generating a topological state in a quantum computer can
be considered as the inverse procedure of the above op-
erational definition. On the digital circuit-based quantum
computer, we start from a direct-product initial state, e.g.,
|0,0,···,0⟩, and apply a quantum circuit to evolve the ini-
tial state to a topologically nontrivial final state. Therefore, it
is generally expected that the depth of a quantum circuit in-
creases with the system size in order to prepare an intrinsic
topological phase [13] or an SPT phase (considering a sym-
metry preserved quantum circuit) [29].
B. E fficient circuit structure for a topological phase
From another perspective, the operational definition of a
topological phase described above provides an idea on how
to design an e fficient variational circuit Ansatz to represent a
topological state. As the first step, we construct a quantum cir-
cuit (as shallow as possible), which can transform the initial
product state to a state sharing the same nontrivial topolog-
ical characterization, i.e., in the same topological phase, as
the desired final state. This part of the circuit is referred to
as the initialization layer hereafter. For example, inspired by
the idea of the renormalization group, the fixed-point state of
the topological phase with zero correlation length is a suitable
choice to be constructed in the initialization layer, such as the
toric code state [42] and the cluster state [12]. However, a
quantum circuit state representing the ground state of a more
generic Hamiltonian cannot be obtained unless its local cor-
relations are further incorporated. We hence need a second
step, in which a parametrized circuit, referred to as the varia-
tional layer, is introduced to correct the quantum circuit state3

generated in the initialization layer. Since the quantum cir-
cuit state generated in the initialization layer already has the
same entanglement structure as the desired topological phase,
we expect that the depth of the variational layer does not in-
crease with the system size. This is indeed the case, as will be
demonstrated in Sec. VI.
Therefore, an e fficient variational circuit Ansatz has the
form
|Ψ(θ)⟩=ˆC(θ)ˆC0|0⟩, (1)
where ˆC0is the initialization layer and ˆC(θ) represents the
variational layer with a set of variational parameters θ.|0⟩is
the initial state where all the quantum registers are set to be
zero. While the depth of ˆC0increases with the system size if
the target final state is an intrinsic topological phase, it is in-
dependent of the system size if the target final state is an SPT
phase, assuming that the symmetry protecting its nontrivial
topology of the SPT phase is broken in the initialization layer.
On the other hand, the depth of ˆC(θ) is always finite and does
not scale with the system size. Indeed, the number Dof lay-
ers in the circuit ˆC(θ) is determined by the local correlation
length of the system. Figure 1 illustrates a flow chart of the
calculation scheme to utilize this circuit Ansatz for simulating
topological phases, which will be employed in the following
sections.
The circuit Ansatz in Eq. (1) can also be regarded as
an AQC process when the initialization layer constructs the
ground state of a Hamiltonian, for example, the fixed point
Hamiltonian, which is adiabatically connected to the final tar-
get Hamiltonian by tuning some model parameters. How-
ever, we should emphasize that the quantum circuit state con-
structed in the initialization layer can also be independent of
any related microscopic Hamiltonians and can be chosen as,

III. SPT HALDANE PHASE IN A SPIN-1 /2 SYSTEM
The original Haldane phase in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain
is hard to be implemented straightforwardly on most of the
currently available quantum computing platforms since a sin-
gle quantum bit is based on a spin-1 /2 object. Nevertheless,
if the Hamiltonian is allowed to break partially the transla-
tional symmetry, the Haldane phase can also exist in a spin-
1/2 chain. One of the examples is the AHC [44], which is
considered in this paper.
The AHC is described by the following Hamiltonian:
H=L/2−1X
i=0 J′S2i·S2i+1+JS2i+1·S2(i+1), (2)
where Lis the number of sites, assumed to be a multiple of 4,
andSkis the spin-1 /2 operator located at site k, enumerated
from 0 to L−1 with SL=S0under periodic boundary condi-
tions. Considering that neighboring two spins at sites 2 iand
2i+1 form an unitcell labeled by i, the number of unitcells is
thus even for Lbeing a multiple of 4 and J′(J) is the intra-
unitcell (inter-unitcell) spin coupling [see Fig. 2(a)]. Without
losing generality, we fix J=1 as the energy unit in this paper.
The ground state phase diagram of the AHC has been well
studied [44] and is shown schematically in Fig. 2(b). At the
J′=1 point, the Hamiltonian Hin Eq. (2) is restored to
the isotropic spin-1 /2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, for
which the ground state has a gapless spin excitation and ex-
hibits power-law decay of the spatial correlation function. For
J′>1, the ground state is in a spin-singlet dimer phase (i.e., a
singlet dimer formed in each unitcell) with a trivial gap. The4
fixed point of this trivial dimer phase is at J′=∞, where
no correlation is built between the neighboring unitcells. For
J′<1, the ground state is a gapped SPT phase sharing the
same nature as the spin-1 Haldane phase [44]. The AHC is
equivalent to the spin-1 Haldane chain at the limit of J′=−∞,
where two spins in the unitcell are grouped to form an e ffec-
tive spin-1 spin with an e ffective inter-unitcell spin coupling
J/4. This SPT Haldane phase is protected by either the Z2×Z2
symmetry with respect to πrotations referring to a pair of or-
thogonal axes [45], the time-reversal symmetry, or the bond
(in the AHC case, the bond connecting two neighboring unit-
cells) centered inversion symmetry [39, 46]. The fixed point
of this SPT phase is at J′=0.
To characterize the nontrivial topological property of the
SPT Haldane phase, similar to the case for the spin-1 model,
we can define the corresponding non-local string operator for
the AHC:
Ostr(d)=Sz
kk+d−1Y
l=k+1exp(iπSz
l)Sz
k+d, (3)
where the spin operator Sz
krepresents the zcomponent of the
total spin in the k-th unitcell, i.e.,Sz
k=Sz
2k+Sz
2k+1. The string
order parameter Ostrcan be defined as Ostr≡lim d→∞⟨Ostr(d)⟩
in the thermodynamic limit, where ⟨···⟩ implies the expec-
tation value over the ground state. For a finite system, we
can evaluate the expectation value of the string operator at the
longest reachable distance din the system, approximating the
string order parameter. In addition, for the system under open
boundary conditions (OBC), localized edge modes provide a
four-fold nearly degenerate ground state, which is also an es-
sential characterization of the Haldane phase. Moreover, this
SPT phase is further characterized uniquely by the two-fold
degeneracy of its entanglement spectrum [45, 46]. To demon-
strate all these three main features of the SPT Haldane phase,
we will focus on the finite AHC under OBC [see Fig. 2(a)] in
the following calculations.
IV . VQE SETUP DETAILS
Following the strategy for the e fficient circuit construction
described in Sec. II, here we first design a variational quantum
circuit Ansatz with eSWAP gates for the VQE calculations of
the AHC. We then discuss comprehensively the symmetry of
thisAnsatz to verify that it is appropriate for the calculation of
the AHC. Furthermore, we briefly explain the natural gradient
descent optimization method with its parameter setup, which
will be employed in the VQE calculations given in Sec. V A.
A. Variational quantum circuit Ansatz
Inspired by the circuit structure in Eq. (1), we construct the
quantum circuit Ansatz for the AHC by separately designing
the initialization layer and the variational layer. For the ini-tialization layer, we consider the following six circuit states:
ˆCs
0|0⟩=|s⟩1,2|s⟩3,4···|s⟩L−1,0≡|ϕs⟩ (4)
ˆC00
0|0⟩=|0⟩0|s⟩1,2|s⟩3,4···|s⟩L−3,L−2|0⟩L−1≡|ϕ00⟩(5)
ˆC01
0|0⟩=|0⟩0|s⟩1,2|s⟩3,4···|s⟩L−3,L−2|1⟩L−1≡|ϕ01⟩(6)
ˆC10
0|0⟩=|1⟩0|s⟩1,2|s⟩3,4···|s⟩L−3,L−2|0⟩L−1≡|ϕ10⟩(7)
ˆC11
0|0⟩=|1⟩0|s⟩1,2|s⟩3,4···|s⟩L−3,L−2|1⟩L−1≡|ϕ11⟩(8)
ˆCd
0|0⟩=|s⟩0,1|s⟩2,3···|s⟩L−2,L−1≡|ϕd⟩, (9)
where|0⟩i(|1⟩i) is the local state at qubit i, corresponding to
siteiin the AHC, with ˆZi|0⟩i=|0⟩i(ˆZi|1⟩i=−|1⟩i) and ˆZibe-
ing the Pauli Z gate at qubit i, and|s⟩i,jindicates a singlet state
formed by two spin-1 /2 spins located at sites iandj. The first
five initialization layers initialize the circuit state to a product
of singlets connecting two neighboring unitcells (except for
|s⟩L−1,0being associated with sites 0 and L−1), which are all
the ground states of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (2) with J′=0
(i.e., the fixed point state for the SPT Haldane phase), recall-
ing that the singlet pair formed at sites 0 and L−1 across
the boundaries in ˆCs
0|0⟩, referred to as|ϕs⟩, does not a ffect the
energy expectation value under OBC. Notice also that among
the states generated in the initialization layers ˆC00
0|0⟩,ˆC01
0|0⟩,
ˆC10
0|0⟩, and ˆC11
0|0⟩, simply referred as |ϕ00⟩,|ϕ01⟩,|ϕ10⟩, and
|ϕ11⟩, respectively, only the local states at the boundary sites 0
andL−1 are distinct and|ϕs⟩can be indeed obtained by a lin-
ear combination of |ϕ10⟩and|ϕ01⟩, i.e.,|ϕs⟩=1√
2(|ϕ10⟩−|ϕ01⟩).
In contrast, the last one ˆCd
0|0⟩in Eq. (9), referred to as |ϕd⟩,
initializes the circuit state to a product of singlets within each
unitcell, which is the J′=∞ground state, i.e., the fixed point
state for the trivial dimer phase.
In detail, the spin singlet |s⟩i,jformed at sites iandj, which
appears in Eqs. (4)–(9), can be generated by the two-qubit
unitary ˆUs
i j, i.e.,
|s⟩i,j=ˆUs
i j|0⟩i|0⟩j (10)
with
ˆUs
i j=ˆCX i jˆHiˆXjˆXi, (11)
where ˆXi(ˆHi) is the Pauli X (Hadamard) gate at qubit iand
ˆCX i jis the controlled-NOT gate with qubit ibeing the control
qubit, resulting in |s⟩i,j=1√
2(|0⟩i|1⟩j−|1⟩i|0⟩j). The quantum
circuits for these six initialization layers in Eqs. (4)–(9) are
explicitly shown in Fig. 3.
Note that the proper basic entanglement structure can be es-
tablished by the corresponding initialization layers for specific
phases, because|ϕs⟩,|ϕ00⟩,|ϕ01⟩,|ϕ10⟩, and|ϕ11⟩in Eqs. (4)–
(8) are all the fixed point state for the SPT Haldane phase,
and|ϕd⟩in Eq. (9) is the fixed point state for the trivial dimer
phase. Indeed, as shown in Appendix A, these circuit states
already exhibit the degeneracy of entanglement spectrum ex-
pected for these two phases. We should also emphasize that
this can be achieved with the depth of the circuit that does not
scale with the system size, although the number of gates ap-
parently increases linearly with the system size. Notice also5

that the four edge mode patterns in the SPT Haldane phase
can be engineered by implementing their precursors in the ini-
tialization layer, as in |ϕ00⟩,|ϕ01⟩,|ϕ10⟩, and|ϕ11⟩, which are
mutually orthogonal.
For the variational layer, we consider a group of brick-
wised eSWAP gates [47–52], which is repeated Dtimes,
hence the depth of the circuit Ansatz being represented by
D. As shown in Fig. 4, the explicit arrangement of eSWAP
gates depends on the initialization layer, acting them first on
the pairs of qubits in which the singlets are not formed in the
initialization layer. A single eSWAP gate acting at qubits iand
jis defined by the two-qubit unitary ˆUi j(θ) as [52]
ˆUi j(θ)=exp(−iθˆPi j/2)
=cos(θ/2)ˆI−isin(θ/2)ˆPi j, (12)
where ˆPi jis the SWAP gate acting at qubits iandj, andθis a
variational parameter assumed real. Therefore, each eSWAP
gate contains a single variational parameter, denoted by θ(d)
i j
for the eSWAP gate acting at qubits iand jin the d-th unit
of the variational layer ˆC(θ) (see Fig. 4), and these variational
parameters θare treated as independent variables.
The physical insight of employing the eSWAP gate comes
from its relation to the resonating valence bond (RVB)
state [53, 54], known as a very faithful variational state to ap-
proximate various many-body ground states of quantum spin
systems [55]. A series of eSWAP gates acting on a particular
direct product of many singlets which covers the lattice, i.e.,
a valence bond solid (VBS) state, can mix up these singlets to
create an RVB state, although the coe fficients of each valence
bond are correlated in someway [52]. For the simplest exam-
ple, considering one eSWAP gate acting on two singlets, we
have
ˆUjk(θ)|s⟩i,j|s⟩k,l=cos(θ/2)|s⟩i,j|s⟩k,l−isin(θ/2)|s⟩i,k|s⟩j,l,
(13)
thus generating di fferent two singlets. The eSWAP circuit
Ansatz has been applied to the VQE calculations of the
one-dimensional (1D) spin-1 /2 isotropic antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model and obtained very accurate results [52].

five initialization layers in Fig. 3 and (b) the last initialization layer
in Fig. 3. Here, we assume L=8 and the elementary unit con-
taining 7 eSWAP gates (denoted by “ e”) is repeated Dtimes in the

eSWAP gates, given by θ(d)
i jfor the eSWAP gate acting on qubits i

Having constructed the explicit form of the variational
quantum circuit Ansatz , we shall now discuss its symmetry
properties. For the initialization layer, its building block, ˆUs

breaks the time-reversal symmetry and the Z2×Z2symme-
try with respect to πrotations referring to a pair of orthogo-
nal axes. Accordingly, ˆC0also breaks these two symmetries.

breaks the bond central inversion symmetry (i.e., odd parity),6
while ˆC0in|ϕd⟩preserve this symmetry (i.e., even parity), as-
suming that Lis a multiple of 4 [56].
Considering now the variational layer, it is straightforward

spect toπrotations referring to a pair of orthogonal axes, i.e.,
ˆUi j(θ(d)

i j), but breaks the time reversal symme-
try, i.e., ˆUi j(θ(d)
i j)T−→ ˆUi j(−θ(d)
i j). Consequently, as the product
of a serial of eSWAP gates, the variational layer preserves the
Z2×Z2symmetry (for any case) and the bond central inversion
symmetry (for the case with reflectable parameters {θ(d)
i j}) but
breaks the time-reversal symmetry. We should note that the
entanglement structure implemented in the initialization layer
is not destroyed by these eSWAP gates in the variational layer,
regardless of the values of variational parameters θ, provided
that the number Dof layers is not large enough to propagate
the quantum information throughout the whole system, i.e.,
D<L/4 (see Appendix A).
Finally, it is instructive to explicitly give an example show-
ing that the SPT state can indeed be connected to a trivial
state by a finite depth quantum circuit that breaks certain sym-
metries. For instance, we can construct a specific circuit ˆC′,
which evolves the SPT state |ϕ00⟩to the trivial dimer state |ϕd⟩,
i.e.,
|ϕd⟩=ˆC′|ϕ00⟩ (14)
with
ˆC′=ˆCd
0(ˆC00
0)−1. (15)
ˆC′has a finite depth not scaling with the system size and
breaks all symmetries which protect the SPT Haldane phase.
In contrast, we will numerically demonstrate in Sec. VI that a
finite depth circuit cannot perform a similar deformation when
the circuit preserves at least one of the symmetries protecting
the SPT phase (also see Appendix A).
B. Optimization method
The variational parameters θinˆC(θ) are optimized by em-
ploying the natural gradient descent (NGD) method [57]. The
variational parameters at the k-th iteration, θk, are updated
fromθk−1as
θk=θk−1−α1
ReG(θk−1)∇E(θk−1), (16)
where E(θ)=⟨Ψ(θ)|H|Ψ(θ)⟩is the variational energy and α
is the descent step. G(θ) is the metric tensor [58] of the pa-
rameter space θassociated with the variational wavefunction
|Ψ(θ)⟩, whose matrix element reads as
[G(θ)]i j=⟨∂θiΨ(θ)|∂θjΨ(θ)⟩−
⟨∂θiΨ(θ)|Ψ(θ)⟩⟨Ψ(θ)|∂θjΨ(θ)⟩. (17)Here,|∂θiΨ(θ)⟩is the partial derivate of |Ψ(θ)⟩with respect
toθi. The NGD optimization has been successfully applied
in the previous VQE study of the 1D Heisenberg model [52].
Moreover, relevant numerical methods sharing the same idea
with the NGD method [59–61] have been widely used to study
quantum many-body systems.
In the calculation of ∇E(θ) and G(θ), we need to fre-
quently calculate the partial derivative, |∂θiΨ(θ)⟩. Here, we
employ the parameter-shift rule [52, 62–65], and apply it as
|∂θiΨ(θ)⟩=1
2|Ψ(θ+πˆi)⟩, (18)
where ˆiis the unit vector for the ith dimension in the parame-
ter space.
For the numerical simulations in Sec. V, we choose the
initial variational parameters θ0=0since we deliberately
start the optimization of the variational parameters in the vari-
ational layer that is applied onto the fixed-point state con-
structed in the initialization layer. We fix α=0.01 and per-
form 1000 steps of optimization to reach the well-converged
state.
V . EXPLORING SPT HALDANE PHASE
With the help of the circuit Ansatz constructed on the ba-
sis of the strategy introduced above, we can obtain the ground
state of the AHC with high accuracy by the VQE calculations.
In this section, we demonstrate this by showing that the SPT
Haldane phase in the AHC can be fully represented by the
shallowest circuit state with D=1 both in numerical simula-
tions and on real quantum devices.
A. Numerical simulations
We simulate the VQE calculations for the ground state of
theL=16 AHC under OBC using the statevector method
provided by Qiskit [66]. Furthermore, the ground state and
the low-lying excited states are also obtained by performing
the exact diagonalization (ED) calculations. In the following
simulations, we always adopt |ϕs⟩as the circuit state in the
initialization layer, unless otherwise stated.
1. Ground state energy and wavefunction fidelity
The ground-state energy deviations of the VQE optimized
circuit state with D=1 from the exact ground state are sum-
marized in Fig. 5(a). For comparison, the energy gap obtained
by the ED method is also plotted in the same figure. Here, as
the energy gap, we consider for J′<1 the Haldane gap given
approximately by the excitation energy to the fourth excited
state because of the four-fold ground state degeneracy in the
SPT phase. For J′>1, the trivial gap of the system is esti-
mated as the excitation gap to the first excited state.
As shown in Fig. 5(a), the energy deviations are smaller
than the energy gap for −2.1≤J′≤0.7, indicating that the7

method as the excitation energy to the fourth (first) excited state. The

circuit Ansatz is a suitable variational Ansatz for the SPT Hal-
dane phase in a finite parameter region. In particular, the en-
ergy deviations are significantly small ( <10−3) in the region
near the J′=0 fixed point.
In addition to the variational energy, the wavefunction fi-
delity between the circuit state |Ψ(θ)⟩and the exact ground
state|Ψ0⟩, defined as
F=|⟨Ψ(θ)|Ψ0⟩|, (19)
is also a crucial evaluation for the circuit Ansatz . Compatible
with the variational energy results, we find in Fig. 5(b) that the
wavefunction fidelity Fare always larger than 0.9 for −2≤
J′≤0.6, implying a high quality approximation to the ground
state. Note also that the wavefunction fidelity Fdecreases
rapidly when J′approaches further closely to the critical point
J′=1 and exhibits a very small value ∼0.25 once it crosses
the critical point in the trivial dimer phase, where this circuit
Ansatz fails to describe the ground state.
2. String order parameter
To measure the nonlocal string operator ⟨Ostr(d)⟩in the
present finite systems, we fix the reference point to the left
end of the system and consider the string order parameter as
Ostr=⟨Ostr(d=L/2−1)⟩. Without losing generality, we
choose four typical values of J′, i.e., J′=−2.1,−0.9, 0.1, and
0.5, in the SPT Haldane phase and display the spatial depen-
dence of the string operator in Fig. 6(a). The results for the

For comparison, the corresponding exact results are also shown by

parameter Ostr=⟨Ostr(d=L/2−1)⟩as a function of J′for the VQE
optimized circuit states with D=1 (red circles) and the exact ground
states (blue circles). Here, the system size is L=16.
VQE optimized circuit states with D=1 are in good quantita-
tive agreement with the exact results, although a slight devia-
tion is observed for J′=−2.1, which is close to the boundary
of the region where the ground state is faithfully expressed by
theD=1 circuit Ansatz (see Fig. 5). In all of these four dif-
ferent J′values, the string operator does not obviously decay,
indicating the long-range string order.
Figure 6(b) shows the string order parameter Ostras a func-
tion of J′. We find that these results for the VQE optimized
circuit state with D=1 are also quantitatively compatible
with the exact results, except for the region close to the crit-
ical point J′=1. Therefore, we conclude that the shallow
circuit state with D=1 can already represent the string-type
correlation rather well.
3. Ground-state degeneracy and edge modes
One of the hallmarks of the SPT Haldane phase is the
four-fold degeneracy of the ground state associated with edge
modes when the system has open boundaries. Using the
eSWAP circuit Ansatz with the circuit states |ϕ00⟩,|ϕ01⟩,|ϕ10⟩,
and|ϕ11⟩in the initialization layer, we can obtain all these
four-fold degenerate ground states in the corresponding opti-
mized circuit states.8
In practice, since ˆC(θ)|ϕ00⟩(ˆC(θ)|ϕ01⟩) and ˆC(θ)|ϕ11⟩
(ˆC(θ)|ϕ10⟩) are related by a global unitary transformation
ˆUX=L−1Y
i=0ˆXi, (20)
i.e., ˆUXˆC(θ)|ϕ00⟩=−ˆC(θ)|ϕ11⟩and ˆUXˆC(θ)|ϕ01⟩=
−ˆC(θ)|ϕ10⟩forLbeing a multiple of 4, and ˆUXHˆUX=H,
we only perform the VQE simulations for the circuit Ans¨ atze
with|ϕ00⟩and|ϕ01⟩in the initialization layer and reuse the
optimized parameters to generate the optimized circuit states
with|ϕ11⟩and|ϕ10⟩in the initialization layer.
As in the case of the string order in Fig. 6, we consider the
four typical J′values, i.e., J′=−2.1,−0.9, 0.1, and 0.5, in
the SPT Haldane phase. For all these di fferent J′values, we
find that the ground-state energies obtained for the VQE opti-
mized circuit states, containing only a D=1 layer, with the
four di fferent circuit states in the initialization layer are nearly
degenerate, and their deviations from the exact ground-state
energies are always smaller than the corresponding Haldane
gap. Furthermore, these four states are orthogonal with each
other; the VQE optimized circuit states ˆC(θ)|ϕ00⟩(ˆC(θ)|ϕ01⟩)
and ˆC(θ)|ϕ11⟩(ˆC(θ)|ϕ10⟩) are exactly orthogonal by construc-
tion and the wavefunction fidelities among other circuit states
are found numerically to be <10−9. Therefore, we have four
mutually-orthogonal nearly-degenerate states in the ground
state manifold.
To further explore the properties of these four VQE opti-
mized circuit states, we probe the edge mode by evaluating the
on-site magnetization ⟨Sz
i⟩. As shown in Fig. 7, we indeed find
distinct edge mode patterns associated with the specific initial-
ization. It is also confirmed that the localization length of the
edge mode is shorter when J′is closer to 0. The results for
the VQE optimized circuit states are in good agreement with
the exact results, although they are slightly deviated from the
exact values for J′=−2.1, which is close to the expressibility
limit of the D=1 variational circuit state (see Fig. 5). These
results clearly demonstrate that the properly constructed vari-
ational quantum circuit state with shallow circuit layers can
capture the details of exotic quantum many-body phases, such
as the edge modes of an SPT phase by engineering four edge
mode patterns in the initialization layer.
B. Real quantum device demonstration
To demonstrate that the circuit Ansatz is also suitable for the
real quantum devices, here the VQE optimized circuit states
obtained classically by the numerical simulations are evolved
on the real quantum devices. As a demonstration, we consider
theL=8 system with J′=0.15 and the VQE optimized
circuit states with D=1 for evaluating the string order and
the spatial distribution of ⟨Sz
i⟩. By performing the quantum
tomography for the L=4 system, we also evaluate bipartite
entanglement spectra in the SPT Haldane phase at J′=0.1
and the trivial dimer phase at J′=10 using the VQE opti-
mized circuit states with D=1.

for completeness.
For this purpose, we employ the quantum devices
(ibmq manila andibmkawasaki ) provided by IBM Quan-
tum [67]. The qubit allocations in the quantum devices used
for the L=4 and 8 systems are shown in Fig. 8(a). As shown
in Fig. 8(b), the eSWAP gate defined in Eq. (12) is further de-
composed into 8 single qubit gates and three CNOT gates in
general [68, 69] (up to a global phase factor). After the tran-
spilation using Qiskit , the number of CNOT gates contained
in the VQE optimized circuit state with D=1 is as many
as 24 (10) for the L=8 (4) system in total when the circuit
state|ϕ00⟩,|ϕ01⟩,ϕ10⟩, or|ϕ11⟩is employed in the initialization
layer. However, note that additional SWAP gates, which are
converted with additional CNOT gates, are required when |ϕs⟩
is employed in the initialization layer. Each experiment runs
8192 shots to collect the data. To estimate the statistical error,
the same experiment with 8192 shots is repeated 10 times.9

1. String order
We should first notice that because of eiπSz
j=iˆZj, the ex-
pectation value of the string operator Ostr(d) in Eq. (3) can be
evaluated simply by measuring all the bit strings in the com-
putational basis on the quantum device. Furthermore, since
thezcomponent of the total spin, Sz
tot=P
jSz
j, is conserved
in the circuit Ansatz , the ideal measurement of each set of all
bit strings in the computational basis must also conserve the
total spin Sz
totat every single experiment. This implies that
the real device noise can be mitigated in each experiment by
post-selecting only those shots which respect Sz
tot=0 (or any
particular value) [29]. For comparison, we also evaluate the
string order in the trivial dimer phase at J′=10 using the
VQE optimized circuit state containing a D=1 layer with
|ϕd⟩in the initialization layer.
As shown in Fig. 9, even in the small system with L=8,
the distinction between the SPT Haldane phase and the trivial
dimer phase can be clearly identified by measuring the string
operator. In the real device experiments, the string operator
shows a smaller value with a slightly faster decay as compared
with the numerical one in the SPT Haldane phase due to the
noise, while it is close to zero in the trivial dimer phase. After
post-selecting the shots respecting Sz
tot=0, the string operator
becomes flatter in the SPT Haldane phase, clearly demonstrat-
ing that these two circuit states can be distinguished on the real
quantum hardware.

system size is L=8 and the VQE optimized circuit state containing

The error bars are estimated as the standard error of the mean from
10 independent sets of the same experiments with each having 8192
shots. For comparison, the numerical results obtained for the same
VQE optimized circuit states (indicated as “ideal”) are also shown
by blue circles. Note that the three results for the trivial dimer phase
are indistinguishable in this scale.
2. Edge modes
Similar to the numerical simulations in Sec. V A 3, the four-
fold nearly degenerate ground states can also be generated on
the real quantum device by constructing the VQE optimized
circuit states containing a D=1 layer with the four di fferent
circuit states,|ϕ00⟩,|ϕ01⟩,|ϕ10⟩, and|ϕ11⟩, in the initialization
layer. Here, we evolve these four optimized circuit Ans¨ atze on
the real device and evaluate the spatial distribution profile of
⟨Sz
i⟩by a series of measurements of individual qubits in the
computational basis. As shown in Fig. 10, the profiles of ⟨Sz
i⟩
exhibit four clearly distinguished patterns, depending on the
different settings in the initialization layer, and they are also
consistent with the numerical results obtained for the same
VQE optimized circuit states.
3. Entanglement spectrum
The SPT phase can also be characterized against the trivial
product state by exploring the degeneracy of the entanglement

ordered in the ascent order. The entanglement spectra of the
SPT Haldane phase exhibit at least two-fold degeneracy for
each spectrum level [46]. In contrast, this degeneracy is split
generally in the trivial dimer phase.
The reduced density matrix for a circuit state can be eval-
uated by quantum tomography [70]. Since a direct procedure
of the quantum tomography involves the measurements of all
Pauli strings referring to the target segment of the system, the
system size which can be treated on the real device is strongly
limited. Therefore, we only consider the L=4 system. Here,
we evolve the two VQE optimized circuit Ans¨ atze with D=1,
which refer to the SPT Haldane phase at J′=0.1 (having
|ϕ00⟩in the initialization layer) and the trivial dimer phase
atJ′=10 (having|ϕd⟩in the initialization layer), on the
real device and perform the quantum tomography to obtain
the reduced density matrices. Figures 11(b) and 11(d) show
the obtained entanglement spectra for the SPT Haldane phase
and the trivial dimer phase, respectively. For comparison, the
corresponding numerical results for the same VQE optimized
circuit states as well as the exact results are also shown in
Figs. 11(a) and 11(c).
We observe that although the spectrum levels slightly devi-
ate from the numerical results, these two circuit states exhibit
a distinguishable entanglement spectrum even on the real de-
vice. Namely, the first and second spectrum levels are quasi-
degenerate in the SPT Haldane phase [see Fig. 11(b)], while
only a single leading spectrum level is observed in the trivial
dimer phase [see Fig. 11(d)], indicating that the state in the
latter is close to a direct-product state. Based on these results,
we confirm that the SPT Haldane phase hosted in the AHC

merical simulations and those in (b) and (d) are evaluated on the IBM

to be doubly degenerate.
can be fully captured by the shallowest circuit states on a real
quantum device.
VI. EXPRESSIBILITY OF CIRCUIT ANSATZ
In the previous section, we have demonstrated that a shal-
low circuit Ansatz with D=1 can already correctly describe
the details of the characteristic features of the SPT Haldane
phase in a finite range of the model parameter J′. Here, in this
section, we discuss the expressibility of this circuit Ansatz and
in particular show that, as in the definition of a SPT phase, a
deeper circuit Ansatz is indeed required to connect the SPT
Haldane phase to the trivial dimer phase if the Ansatz pre-
serves the symmetry protecting the SPT phase. We also show
that the expressibility (i.e., computational capacity) of the
fixed depth circuit Ansatz with the appropriate initialization
is insensitive to the system size and scales with the spin cor-
relation length. Therefore, the scalable VQE calculations for
a gapped topological phase can be achieved once the circuit
representation of a fixed-point state in the gapped topological
phase is first correctly constructed in the initialization layer.
A. Connecting the Haldane phase to the dimer phase
In order to test how deep a circuit is necessary to connect
an SPT state to a trivial state, we perform numerically the
VQE calculations for the L=12 system in the trivial dimer
phase at J′=5 employing the circuit Ansatz with|ϕs⟩, i.e., a
fixed-point state of the SPT Haldane phase, in the initializa-
tion layer. Since the variational layer preserves the symmetry
which protects the SPT Haldane phase, we expect that a triv-
ial state cannot be obtained in the optimized circuit when its11
depth is too shallow. Here, we employ the degeneracy of the
entanglement spectrum to di fferentiate the SPT Haldane phase
from the trivial dimer phase.

uated from the reduced density matrix of the VQE optimized
circuit states with di fferent depths. Here, the reduced density
matrix is obtained by bipartitioning the system exactly at half
about the center. We find that the lowest four spectrum lev-
els are always degenerate when the circuits are too shallow
(D≤2), indicating these circuit states still host a SPT state.
As a sharp di fference, the entanglement spectrum of the op-
timized circuit Ansatz with D=3 is highly consistent with
the exact result, especially in the lowest-lying part of the en-
tanglement spectrum, suggesting that the evolution from an
SPT state to a trivial product state is accomplished. Indeed,
the number of layers composed of local unitary operators nec-
essary to convert two states with di fferent topological indices
should scale with the system size L[40], and in this particular
system with L=12, the D=3 layers correspond exactly to
the point where the causality cone set by the Lieb-Robinson
bound for propagating the information via the local two-qubit
gates exceeds the system size [27]. More discussion on the de-
generacy of entanglement spectrum for the circuit states con-
sidered here is found in Appendix A.
B. Expressibility vs. correlation length
One measure for the expressibility of a particular circuit
Ansatz for a ground state is to simply monitor the energy devi-
ation of the circuit Ansatz with the optimized parameters from
the exact ground-state energy. Although the spin correlation
length is hard to determine straightforwardly in a small finite
system, we can use the spin correlation function at a fixed dis-
tance from the edge as a reasonable approximation.Figure 13 shows the relation between the expressibility of
the circuit Ansatz with D=1 and the spin correlation func-
tion for the SPT Haldane phase in the AHC. The result clearly
reveals that the expressibility for di fferent system sizes has
the same scaling behavior with the correlation length, imply-
ing that the expressibility of the circuit Ansatz with a fixed
depth considered here is dictated not by the system size but
rather by the correlation length. Moreover, since the energy
deviation does not increase with the system size, the compu-
tational complexity of the VQE calculations with a given ac-
curacy scales only linearly with the system size (not because
of the increase of the circuit depth, but simply because of the
increase of the the number of qubits).

VII. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
In summary, we have proposed a strategy to e fficiently con-
struct a variational circuit Ansatz for calculating a ground state
of a gapped topological phase on NISQ devices. To properly
handle both the nontrivial basic entanglement structure con-
tained in the topological phase and the fine structure in the en-
ergy landscape depending on the details of the Hamiltonian,
an efficient circuit Ansatz should be designed in a two-layer
structure. In the first layer (i.e., the initialization layer), the
basic entanglement structure is constructed by a shallow cir-
cuit with a fixed depth that does not scale with the system
size (or a circuit with a well-designed structure for an intrinsic
topological phase). For the SPT Haldane phase in the AHC,
the initialization layer constitutes the ground state of the fixed
point Hamiltonian with J′=0. In the second layer (i.e.,
the variational layer), a parametrized circuit inspired by the12
Hamiltonian itself is considered to further optimize the state
to fit the finite correlations determined by the Hamiltonian pa-
rameter away from the fixed point. In the AHC, a brick-wised
eSWAP circuit is adapted to respect the SU(2) symmetry of
the Hamiltonian and preserve one of the symmetries protect-
ing the SPT Haldane phase. All the main features of the SPT
Haldane phase, including the long-range string order parame-
ter, the four-fold nearly degenerate ground states correspond-
ing to edge mode patterns in the open system, and the two-fold
degenerate entanglement spectrum, have been captured cor-
rectly by the optimized circuit state with a very shallow depth
(D=1) both in numerical simulations and on real quantum
devices. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the computa-
tional capacity is only sensitive to the correlation length and is
independent of the system size. Therefore, the scalable VQE
calculation is achieved in this system.
Although we have only considered the simplest 1D SPT
phase in this paper, the circuit Ansatz structure proposed here
can be directly applied to higher-dimensional cases. Espe-
cially for a two-dimensional (2D) SPT phase, whose fixed-
point wavefunction is easily constructed by a very shallow cir-
cuit [71], a similar variational layer that preserves the symme-
try protecting the SPT phase can also be constructed straight-
forwardly to treat a fine structure of the Hamiltonian. The
same idea can also be applied to a gapped topological spin
liquid, for which further investigation is however required as
to how to generally construct a circuit state for a particular
spin liquid phase.
Moreover, recalling that the depth of the variational layer
does not increase with the system size to represent a gapped
topological phase with a given accuracy, we realize the po-
tential of achieving the quantum advantage by employing the
scheme proposed here. At first glance, the computational
complexity for the VQE calculation scales linearly with the
system size. However, we should point out that, in principle,
all the computation components, such as the calculation of the
partial derivative for each parameter and the procedure of en-
ergy measurement, can be fully parallelized. In contrast, the
computational complexity of the current state-of-the-art ten-
sor network algorithms [72], which are considered to be the
most e fficient classical methods to simulate quantum many-
body systems, increases at least linearly with the system size.
Therefore, the quantum advantage can be achieved when the
system size is very large in one dimension or simply when a
2D system is considered.

Appendix A: Entanglement spectrum of the circuit Ansatz
In this Appendix, we shall examine the degeneracy of the
entanglement spectrum extracted from the circuit Ansatz pro-
posed in Sec. IV A. Without losing generality, we fix the sys-
tem size to L=12 and choose the circuit state |ϕ00⟩in the
initialization layer (a fixed-point state for the SPT Haldane
phase). For comparison, we also consider a circuit state with
|ϕd⟩in the initialization layer, corresponding to a fixed-point
state for the trivial dimer phase. After applying di fferent
number Dof layers in the variational layer composed of the
eSWAP gates with randomly chosen variational parameters θ,
we evaluate the entanglement spectrum of the resulting circuit
state by numerically diagonalizing the reduced density matrix
for the left half of the system.
For the circuit states initialized to the fixed-point state of the
SPT phase, the entanglement spectrum shows robust (at least)
two-fold degeneracy when the depth Dof the variational layer
is smaller than L/4 [see Figs. 14(a)–14(c)]. Note that the num-
ber of nontrivial entanglement spectral levels (i.e., nonzero
eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix) increases with D
as 2×4D. In sharp contrast, this two-fold degeneracy is lifted
entirely once the depth of the variational layer D≥L/4, as
shown in Figs. 14(d)–14(f). This clearly demonstrates that a
sufficiently deep circuit is required to transform an SPT state
to a trivial state if the circuit respects the symmetry protect-
ing the SPT phase. In order to support this assertion, we also
consider exactly the same circuit state with D=1 but with an
additional single CNOT gate, which breaks the symmetry pro-
tecting the SPT phase, acting after the eSWAP gate on qubits 5
and 6 [see, e.g., Fig. 4(a) for L=8], and find that only a single
CNOT gate is enough to generally lift the two-fold degeneracy
of the entanglement spectra, as shown in Fig. 14(b) by solid
diamonds. We should also note that the circuit depth D=L/4
corresponds exactly to the point where the causality cone set
by the Lieb-Robinson bound for propagating the information
via local two-qubit gates reaches the system size L[27]. It
is also interesting to notice that only the circuit states having
D=L/4 layers or more can describe all 2L/2entanglement
spectral levels of the reduced density matrix for a general 1D
quantum state when it is bipartitioned exactly half.
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 15, the circuit states
initialized to the fixed-point state of the trivial dimer phase
exhibit a distinguishable single leading entanglement spectral
level when D<L/4, while this feature disappears in general
when D≥L/4. Note that the number of the nontrivial entan-
glement spectral levels in this case increases with Das 4D.13

Din the variational layer composed of the eSWAP gates for which
the variational parameters θare chosen randomly. The system size
is set to L=12 and the the entanglement spectrum is evaluated by
numerically diagonalizing the reduced density matrix of the system
bipartitioned exactly half. Note that the results shown here are ob-
tained for a single set of random parameters, but we have checked
that qualitatively the same results are obtained for other sets of ran-
dom parameters. For comparison, the results for the same circuit
state with D=1 having the same random variational parameters θ,
but containing an additional single CNOT gate acting on qubits 5 and
6 are also plotted by solid diamonds in (b).
Appendix B: Ddependence of string order
In Sec. V, we demonstrate that the shallow D=1Ansatz
can faithfully describe the SPT Haldane phase in a wide pa-
rameter region. Here, we examine numerically how the ac-
curacy of the VQE calculation is further improved with in-
creasing the circuit Ansatz depth D. Figure 16(a) shows the
expectation value of string operator, ⟨Ostr(d)⟩, evaluated nu-
merically for the VQE optimized circuit Ans¨ atze|Ψ(θ)⟩with
D=1, 2, and 3. We can indeed confirm that, for a fixed J′, it
approaches to the exact value with increasing D. Accordingly,
as shown in Fig. 16(b), the string order parameter Ostralso be-
comes closer to the exact value, even for J′away from J′=0
within−2.5<J′<1, indicating that more fine correlations
of the ground state can be captured quantitatively by a deeper
circuit Ansatz .

this circuit Ansatz asSO(4) brick wall Ansatz . The number
of parameters in SO(4) brick wall Ansatz scales with Das
6×(L−1)×D. Note that since the ground state of the AHC
can always be represented by a real wavefunction, utilizing a
real state|Φ⟩as an Ansatz , instead of a circuit Ansatz based
on more general SU(4) two-qubit gates, is advantageous for
reducing the variational search space.
We perform VQE simulations for typical values of J′in
the SPT Haldane phase using SO(4) brick wall Ans¨ atze with
D=1, 2, and 3, and the results of the ground-state energy are
compared with those for the VQE optimized circuit Ans¨ atze
|Ψ(θ)⟩with D=1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 17. While the SO(4) brick
wall Ansatz has more variational parameters, the VQE opti-
mized circuit Ansatz|Ψ(θ)⟩consistently obtains better energy
with the deviation from the exact value at least one order of
magnitude smaller than the SO(4) brick wall Ansatz . More-
over, the convergence to the exact value with increasing D,
i.e., the number of the variational parameters, is much faster
for the circuit Ansatz|Ψ(θ)⟩. This comparison clearly demon-
strates the superiority of the circuit Ansatz|Ψ(θ)⟩proposed in14
