instrument at the VLT,and an in-depth analysis of this compact group. To obtain a complete understanding of the system, we
derived radial velocity and dispersion velocity maps, maps of the ionization mechanism of the system, chemical abundances
and their distribution over the whole system, star formation rates and ages of the diÔ¨Äerent star-forming regions, and the spatial
distribution of the Wolf-Rayet stellar population. We also reconstructed the star formation history of the galaxies HCG 31 A,
C, B and F, measured the emission-line Ô¨Çuxes, and performed a stellar population synthesis. Our main Ô¨Åndings are: (i) that
there is clearly disturbed kinematics due to the merger event that the system is experiencing; (ii) that the ionization is produced
exclusivelyviastarformationexceptforthenucleusofthegalaxyHCG31A,wherethereisasmallcontributionofshocks;(iii)
that there is low oxygen abundance distributed homogeneously through the system; (iv) that there is a prominent population of

1 INTRODUCTION
The processes of formation and transformation of galaxies are cru-
cial for understanding their evolution. According to the hierarchical
modelofgalaxyformation,theinteractionsbetweensmallgalaxiesat
highredshiftarethefoundationsfortheformationofcurrentgalaxies
(Toomre & Toomre 1972), therefore, a detailed study of local inter-
acting/merging galaxies can provide important information regard-
ing diÔ¨Äerent phenomena that were common in the distant universe.
Agreatadvantageofstudyinggalaxymergersandinteractionsinthe
local universe is the high spatial resolution that we have due to the
proximityoftheseobjects.Althoughvariousstudieshavebeendone
comparingthepropertiesofgalaxiesinthelocalanddistantuniverse
(Epinat et al. 2010, P√©rez-Montero et al. 2021, Izotov et al. 2021),
it should be noted that there are clear diÔ¨Äerences between studying
galaxy mergers in the local universe and studying at high redshift.
For example, the mass of the gas has evolved with redshift and also
thestarformationrates(SFR)(Mannuccietal.2010,Behroozietal.
2013,Madau & Dickinson 2014, Amor√≠n et al. 2015, Boyett et al.
2022). Thus, the comparison of physical processes and phenomena

2020).
Duringthepastfewyears,severalauthorshavestudiedinteracting
galaxies by analyzing their physical properties (Zaragoza-Cardiel

et al. 2018), as well as from the point of view of their kinematic
properties(Planaetal.2003,Amrametal.2007,Torres-Floresetal.
2010).TheseeÔ¨Äortshaveallowedustounderstandtheroleofgalaxy
interactions in their evolution, however, several questions remain
open,withnoclearanswers.Forexample,becauseoftheinteraction
between galaxies an increase in their SFR was expected. Various
authors have proposed diÔ¨Äerent scenarios to explain this increase.
Xuetal.(2010)studiedasampleofpairsofspiral-ellipticalgalaxies
and found that most spiral galaxies did not show an increase in their
SFRs. On the other hand, Patton et al. (2011) studied a sample of
galaxy pairs and found that they did increase their SFRs, which was
expectedduetotheinteractionprocessesbetweengalaxies.Addition-
ally, Ellison et al. (2011) found that galaxies associated in pairs had
a higher fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to iso-
lated galaxies. Rupke et al. (2010a) found that interacting galaxies
exhibited more Ô¨Çattened metallicity gradients than those observed
in isolated galaxies, a phenomenon that could be produced by the
interaction between galaxies.
There are other processes in galaxy interactions that result in the
formation of new galaxies. Duc & Mirabel (1998) studied the inter-
acting system NGC 5291, where they found star-forming objects in
theintergalacticmedium.Theauthorsclaimedthatthissuggestedthe
existence of newly formed tidal dwarf galaxies in NGC 5291. These
objectsshouldbefreeofdarkmatterandshouldhavehighmetallic-
ities (considering their masses). In addition to the TDGs detected in
NGC5291,otherauthorshavedetectedandstudiedTDGcandidates
in diÔ¨Äerent interacting systems (Weilbacher et al. 2003, de Mello
et al. 2012).
As shown before, interacting and merging systems are ideal lab-
oratories for understanding the diÔ¨Äerent physical and kinematical
processesthattakeplaceinouruniverse.Variousobservationaltech-
niques have been used over the years to investigate these systems,
such as optical imaging, longslit spectroscopy, Fabry-Perot data, HI
data cubes, and recently, 3D spectroscopy. The integral Ô¨Åeld spec-
troscopytechnique(IFS)isoneofthemostpowerfulapproachesfor

gravitational encounters are quite common.
InthisworkwedevelopedadeepspectroscopicstudyoftheHick-
son Compact Group 31, which is a complex interacting system of
dwarf galaxies located in the nearby universe (Rubin et al. 1990).
Several authors (Iglesias-Paramo & Vilchez 1997, L√≥pez-S√°nchez
et al. 2004, Mendes de Oliveira et al. 2006, Amram et al. 2007,

2015) have studied this object but none of them have combined a
well-adapted spatial coverage with a broad spectral coverage, which
is the case for the MUSE data presented in this work. Thus, this
paper provides, for the Ô¨Årst time, a complete view of this group,
based on MUSE/VLT data of the main galaxies of the system and
of the southern tidal tail. Therefore, the analyses presented in this

are presented in sections 6 and 7, respectively.2 THE HICKSON COMPACT GROUP 31
Our object of study consists of a speciÔ¨Åc group of galaxies, the
Hickson Compact Group 31 (RA [Deg] = 75.409572, DEC [Deg] =
-4.257011). This group lies at a distance of 59.38 4.16 Mpc. That
distancewasmeasuredassumingaredshiftof ùëß=0¬ï013470¬ï00002
(Wong et al. 2006) and a value of the Hubble constant of ùêª0=

This group consists of many low-mass galaxies with low-
metallicities(MendesdeOliveiraetal.2006),andallofthemarein

makesHCG31anideallaboratorytostudygalacticyinteractionsand

DuetoitsconÔ¨Åguration,HCG31isaverywell-studiedobjectand
many authors have contributed information about this system, (e.g
Rubin et al. 1990, Iglesias-Paramo & Vilchez 1997, L√≥pez-S√°nchez
et al. 2004, Amram et al. 2007, Alfaro-Cuello et al. 2015, Torres-
Flores et al. 2015, among others). Hickson (1982) classiÔ¨Åed it as a
compact group of galaxies. In this study the authors detected four
members in this group, HCG31 A, B, C and D. Rubin et al. (1990)
detected four new members, HCG31 E, F, G and Q, and concluded
that member D was not part of the group due to its higher redshift.
More recently, Mendes de Oliveira et al. (2006) detected another
memberofthesystem,HCG31R.Currently,weaccepttheevidence
that HCG31 consists of nine galaxies: A, B, C, E, F, G, H, Q and
R. Figure 1 presents an optical image of the group with eight of the
members labeled (member R is not seen due to its low brightness).
The entire group is embedded in a common envelope of neutral
hydrogen, which has a total HI mass of 2¬ï11010ùëÄ(Williams
etal.1991).TheseauthorsalsofoundthattheHIdistributionpeaked
at the overlap region between HCG31 A and HCG31 C.
L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. (2004) performed a complete study of this
system. They developed a deep analysis of the physical properties
by using optical imaging, near-infrared (NIR) imaging, and optical
medium-resolution long-slit spectroscopy. An interesting result ob-
tained by these authors was the detection of a Wolf-Rayet bump in
the spectrum of the galaxy HCG31 C, which indicates the presence
of Wolf-Rayet stars with very young ages (< 4 Myrs). This bump
can be identiÔ¨Åed with the blend of the spectral lines He ùêºùêºùúÜ4686√Ö,
Cùêºùêºùêº/CùêºùëâùúÜ4650√Ö and NùêºùêºùêºùúÜùúÜ4634¬ñ4640√Ö. Moreover, the most
important emission in the bump arises from the helium lines. The
presence of such stars is strong evidence of a young starburst in
this system. In addition, these authors found that all the members
of the group displayed low oxygen abundance, spanning a range of

traced stellar emission (at this redshift). The LZR obtained by the
authors suggested that galaxies C, G and B followed that relation-
ship. Members H, R, E and F showed higher metallicities for their
luminosities, which led the authors to suggest that these members
couldbetidaldebrisorTDGcandidates,becausethistypeofobject
retains the metallicity of its parent galaxy (Weilbacher et al. 2003).
AdeepstudyofthecentralregionofHCG31wasdonebyAlfaro-
Cuello et al. (2015). The authors used IFS observations taken with
GMOS/Gemini, centered in the overlap region between galaxies A
and C, and found a high SFR density in the central region. Using
the same data Torres-Flores et al. (2015) detected a Ô¨Çat gradient in
the oxygen abundance map linking galaxies A and C. This gradient
suggested gas mixing in the interface between galaxies A and C
(Torres-Floresetal.2015).Alfaro-Cuelloetal.(2015)alsodetected
a super star cluster (SSC) near the nucleus of galaxy HCG31 C.

These authors speculated that this SSC was currently triggering star
formation in their surroundings.
As shown above, HCG31 oÔ¨Äers an ideal place to seek for an-
swers to diÔ¨Äerent open questions in the Ô¨Åeld of interacting/merging
galaxies.

(WFM), where each Ô¨Åeld covers a Ô¨Åeld-of-view of 1x1 arcmin2,
with a spatial sampling of 0.2arcsec and a spectral range of 4750-
9350√Ö for a 1.25√Ö step. The mean seeing during the observations
was0.9arcsec, with a mean airmass of 1.15. Considering the dis-
tance to the system (59.38 Mpc) our mean seeing implies a spatial

anism of ionization, and the measurement of line-emission Ô¨Çuxes,
stellar population synthesis (SPS) and kinematics.
4.1 Emission-line measurement
The emission lines have been measured using two codes: FADO3
(Ô¨Åtting analysis using diÔ¨Äerential evolution optimization, Gomes &
Papaderos 2017) and /i.pc/f.pc/s.pc/c.pc/u.pc/b.pc/e.pc4(Ruschel-Dutra & Dall‚ÄôAgnol De
Oliveira 2020). The Ô¨Årst is designed to perform spectral popula-

aP/y.pc/t.pc/h.pc/o.pc/n.pc5package of spectral analysis routines which Ô¨Åt Gaussian
proÔ¨Åles to emission lines. We used /i.pc/f.pc/s.pc/c.pc/u.pc/b.pc/e.pcto obtain the radial ve-
locity and velocity dispersion maps because FADOs not optimized
for such calculations. Due to the spectral resolution of the MUSE
data (average R3000), we Ô¨Åtted a single Gaussian proÔ¨Åle to the
observed line instead of performing a multi component analysis.
In Figure 2 we show the line-emission maps obtained for H ùõΩ,

4.2 Kinematics: Radial velocity and velocity dispersion
Kinematic analysis was done by using /i.pc/f.pc/s.pc/c.pc/u.pc/b.pc/e.pcon the Hùõºemission
line. The uncertainties of radial velocities were calculated using the
formulas of Lenz & Ayres (1992) and the Ô¨Åtting parameters were
derived by using /i.pc/f.pc/s.pc/c.pc/u.pc/b.pc/e.pc.
The width of a Gaussian proÔ¨Åle is usually determined by the full

ing to the formula given by Lenz & Ayres (1992) with the Ô¨Åtting
parameters of /i.pc/f.pc/s.pc/c.pc/u.pc/b.pc/e.pc.
The stellar kinematic analysis were not perfomed due to the in-
strinsic weak continuum of the spaxels, which makes the Ô¨Åt of the
stellar absorption lines diÔ¨Écult.
4.3 Oxygen abundances
The metallicity distribution in spiral galaxies has been extensively
studiedduringthelastyears(vanZeeetal.1998Bresolinetal.2012,S√°nchezetal.2014).Mostofgiantgalaxiesshowaclearabundance
gradient, with the center of the galaxy being more metallic than

proven that interacting galaxies show Ô¨Çatter abundance gradient.
Owing to the spectral range of our data it was not possible to derive
theoxygenabundanceusingthedirectmethodbecausewecouldnot

use the strong-line methods as oxygen abundance indicator, given
thatthesemethodsmainlyusestrongemission-lineswhichtypically

We use the calibrations obtained by Marino et al. (2013) for the
N2 and O3N2 calibrators
MNRAS 000, 1‚Äì20 (2023)5
We also use the code HII-CHI M/i.pc/s.pc/t.pc/r.pc/y.pc (P√©rez-Montero 2014)
which is a collection of python scripts that analyze the intensities
fromseveralbrightemissionlinesobservedintheoptical(inourcase
Hùõº, HùõΩ, [N/i.pc/i.pc]ùúÜ6584√Ö and [O /i.pc/i.pc/i.pc]ùúÜ5007√Ö). This code estimates
the oxygen abundance by using grids of photoionization models.
4.4 Star formation rate determination
The SFR is a key parameter in galaxy evolution and represents the
amount of gas that is converted into stars per unit of time. Several
authors have studied how the environment plays a role in the star
formation rate of interacting/merging systems (Mihos & Hernquist
1996,Boselli&Gavazzi2006,Xuetal.2010,Teyssieretal.2010,Pat-
ton et al. 2011,Pontzen et al. 2017).
Kennicutt & Evans (2012) reviewed the most used SFR calibra-
tors to date, and they reÔ¨Åned the equations, including for ùêªùõº. They
propose, for ùêø¬πùêªùõº¬∫, the following expression, assuming a Chabrier
IMF, and a continuous SF process:
ùëôùëúùëîùëÜùêπùëÖ¬πùëÄùë¶ùëü 1¬∫=ùëôùëúùëîùêø¬πùêªùõº¬∫¬πùëíùëüùëîùë† 1¬∫ 41¬ï27 (2)
On this paper we use H ùõºas tracer of SFRs. The uncertainties are
calculated by propagating the Ô¨Çux errors given by FADOand using
an uncertainty on the distance of 4.16 Mpc (explained in section 2).
4.5 H alpha equivalent width and age determination
The Hùõºequivalent width EW( ùêªùõº) gives us a good estimation of
the ratio between ionizing photons of massive stars and continuum
photonsoftheunderlyingstellarpopulationanditiscommonlyused
todatestarformationevents.Oneofthemodelsusedtoestimateages
is given by STARBURST99 (Leitherer 1990), which is used in this
work, given that it was previously used in the analysis of HCG31
(L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. 2004, Alfaro-Cuello et al. 2015). Therefore,
we will be able to compare our Ô¨Åndings with these previous studies.
STARBURST99 generates models for the evolution of diÔ¨Äerent
properties of a single stellar population, considering an instanta-
neous burst or a continuous star formation process. The predictions
are available for Ô¨Åve diÔ¨Äerent stellar metallicities: ( 2ùëç,ùëç,0¬ï4ùëç,
0¬ï2ùëç, and 0¬ï005ùëç), and for three diÔ¨Äerent initial mass functions,
covering ages from 106to109years. On this work we used a model
for a Z = 0.004 and Z = 0.008 metallicities, based on the observed
oxygen abundance of the system.
4.6 Ionization mechanism: BPT diagnostic diagrams
Distinguishing the diÔ¨Äerent ionization mechanism in a galaxy is
a very important and challenging topic in extragalactic astronomy.
Baldwin et al. (1981) used a database of extragalactic objects to
classifythemaccordingtotheirionizationmechanism.Thepredom-
inant ionization mechanism in an extragalactic object could be i)
photo-ionization by OB stars, ii) a power-law continuum source,
and iii) shock wave heating (Baldwin et al. 1981). In this con-
text, diagnostic diagrams based on emission line ratios, for instance

tensivelyusedduringthelastdecadestodetermineionizationmech-
anisms (hereafter, BPT diagrams).
ThelimitswhichdividethediÔ¨Äerentionizationmechanismsisnot
fully clear. Kewley et al. (2001) studied the properties of starburst
galaxies using the codes PEGASE andSTARBURST99 , which al-
lowed them to derive an upper limit for the starburst region in the
BPT diagrams.KauÔ¨Ämannetal.(2003)studiedasampleof22623AGNsat 0¬ï02¬ü

Kewley et al. (2001), and the zone between both limits corresponds
to the so-called composite region, which probably host a mixture

FADOallows us to reconstruct the Star Formation History (SFH)
of some object by Ô¨Åtting a combination of Single Stellar Popula-
tion (SSP) to the spectrum of the galaxy, obtaining a population
vector. This population is based on the Bruzual & Charlot (2003)
stellar libraries. In order to calculate the ages and metallicities of
the best-Ô¨Åtting vector FADOsubstracts the nebular continuum from
the observed spectra. The resulting stellar population is used to vi-
sualizetheSFHofthegalaxybytheluminosityatthenormalization
wavelenght of the diÔ¨Äerent SSPs (see Gomes & Papaderos 2017 for
details). For HCG31, we use 5100 √Ö as the normalization wave-
length.

HCG31 shows a complex kinematics, and we could not assign
a single rotating pattern for the whole system (Amram et al. 2007
hereafterA07).WeidentiÔ¨ÅedthreediÔ¨Äerentkinematicentities:i)the
centralregion(A+C),(ii)awesternmembercalledgalaxyB,and(iii)
the southern tidal tail composed of three sub-regions (E1, E2), (H1,
H2, H3) and (F1, F2, F3). These three entities are labeled with gray
ellipsesintheleftpanelofFigure3.Thegroupcoversaverynarrow
range in velocity space ( 200km s 1), which was also reported by
other authors (Rubin et al. 1990, Richer et al. 2003, L√≥pez-S√°nchez
et al. 2004, Amram et al. 2007). This indicates that the system has a
very low velocity dispersion, which is expected for compact groups
composed of late-type (or gas-rich) galaxies Hickson et al. (1988).
The central region shows a rotating pattern from East to West,
with a position angle (PA) 120. A07 derived diÔ¨Äerent kinematic
parameters for this region. They estimated a mass of approximately
4¬ï5109ùëÄ,PA=1303,andaninclinationof52 5.Theam-
plitude in radial velocity for this central region is about 150km
s 1. To analyze the velocity gradient of galaxy A, we simulated the
PAusedbyVerdes-Montenegroetal.(2005)intheanalysisoftheHI
mapofHCG31(Figure3,leftpanel,horizontallineinregionA+C).
The velocity gradient, shown in Figure 5, displays values similar to
those presented by previous researchers.
It should be noted that the slit passes through the zone where
the Hùõºdouble components are seen in the high-resolution Fabry-
Perotdataofthissystem(A07).Thus,thevelocitygradientshownin

To conÔ¨Årm the kinematic nature of the central merger, we em-
ployedtheMocKinGcode6describedinMercieretal.(2022)which
allowsonetoÔ¨ÅtarotatingdiskmodeltothevelocityÔ¨ÅeldwithÔ¨Åxed
projection parameters across the galaxy (position angle of major
axis, center, inclination and systemic velocity). We used a Courteau
rotation curve model (Courteau 1997) described by the following
equation:

the sharpness of the turnover after ùëüùë°. We useùõΩ=0to reduce the
number of free parameters as done in G√≥mez-L√≥pez et al. (2019).
We also Ô¨Åxed the center to a position inferred from the geometrical
center of the continuum emission.
MocKinG uses a forward modeling approach that takes into ac-
count the limited spatial resolution of the data by weighting the
velocity by the Ô¨Çux distribution within the point spread function
and across each pixel (see Appendix of Epinat et al. 2010, for more
details). It can use either a Levenberg-Markwardt algorithm (Mark-
wardt 2009) or the multimodal nest sampling algorithm Multinest
(Feroz & Hobson 2008; Buchner et al. 2014) to Ô¨Ånd the Ô¨Åt param-
eters. We used the latter solution that is much more robust to local
minima.

The kinematics parameters obtained from the Ô¨Åt were: PA =

hibitingarotationalpattern.Thisreinforcesthehypothesisproposed
byA07,wheretheysuggestthatwhatweareobservinginthecentral
region is the merging of the HCG 31 A and HCG 31 C galaxies.
There are also two sub-structures, A1 and A2, in the central re-
gion (Fig. 3, left panel). These sub-structures are part of the north-
ern tidal tail of the group (Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2005). These
sub-structures are most likely composed of material stripped from
member A due to the interaction, which now are falling back into
thegalaxy(MendesdeOliveiraetal.2006,Amrametal.2007).The
slit in these objects does not show a considerable velocity variation
inA1,butthereisalowamplitudeinA2( 40kms 1).Thelatteris
counter-rotating relative to A+C, which suggests that it is currently
falling back (A07). In contrast, A1 does not show a considerable
velocitygradient.Probablyitisrotatingtangentially,anditsrounded
shape may be evidence of that. In any case, the projected distance
to the central merger ( 9kpc) is quite small and it does not have
enough mass to gravitationally separate from the central merger (

For galaxy B, A07 derived the following kinematic parameters;

Our velocity gradient (applying an inclination correction assuming
ùëñ= 605) is consistent with the determinations of A07 and also
with the HI map presented by Verdes-Montenegro et al. (2005).

it is noteworthy that an interesting pattern is observed with negative
residuals in the central regions and positive residuals in the outer
parts.
The southern tidal tail is the most extended structure in our Ô¨Åeld-
of-view,(20,kpcfromE1toF3).Itiscomposedofthreestructures,

Galaxy E presents a steep velocity gradient with amplitude of

because of its counter-rotation. Within this structure we identiÔ¨Åed
two main knots of star formation that we denominated E1 and E2
(Figure 3, left panel). The diÔ¨Äerence in velocity between these two

Wespeculatethatthiskinematicbehaviorisaresulttorotationonthe

arguingthatthisexplanationisveryunlikelybecauseoftheextended
morphology of object F. The velocity of F1 and F2 is 3980km
s 1, which is consistent with the HI motions, and more like the
velocity of the E member. Considering the velocity of member H,
the values obtained for member F could lead to misinterpretations
aboutthenatureofthetail,whichshowstheimportanceofstudying
2DvelocityÔ¨Åelds.Usinglong-slitdata,L√≥pez-S√°nchezetal.(2004)
obtained a velocity gradient for the tidal tail, but they interpreted
it as being two diÔ¨Äerent kinematic structures contained in the same

tail that connects A+C with G.

south of F2 and F3 is seen on our velocity gradient, suggesting that
they are part of the same object. Comparing our velocity Ô¨Åeld with
the HI velocity map of the tail we see that F1, F2, and F3 are part
of the region kinematically detached from the tail. This explanation
favors the scenario in which F is a TDG in formation.5.2 Velocity dispersion
TheHùõºvelocitydispersion( ùúéùëñùëõùë°)(Fig.3,rightpanel)wasobtained
by using the parameters derived from a single gaussian Ô¨Åtting per-
formedby /i.pc/f.pc/s.pc/c.pc/u.pc/b.pc/e.pcandadeconvolutionofinstrumentalandthermal
dispersion.
Objects A1, A2, B, E, H, and F show low values of velocity
dispersion (5km s 1<ùúéùëñùëõùë°¬ü30km s 1) (Fig. 3, right panel).
However, high-resolution data is required to understand the internal
kinematicsofthesesourcesindetail,giventhattheMUSEresolution
(50km s 1) is not high enough to search for expanding shells using
diagnostic diagrams; therefore, our determinations on these values
areupperlimitsforthesesources.Nonetheless,accordingtoMoiseev
et al. (2015), these velocity dispersion values (10 km ùë† 1¬ü ùúéùëñùëõùë°<
30 km s 1) are quite typical for H /i.pc/i.pcgalaxies and giant H /i.pc/i.pcregions
(Firpo et al. 2011).
The A+C complex is the most interesting zone in the velocity
dispersion map. It hosts the highest values of ùúéùëñùëõùë°in the HCG31
system,withapeakof 95kms 1,anditsdistributionisnotspatially
correlated with H ùõºcontours. The two main H ùõºknots in the central
region show similar velocity dispersion values of 50km s 1.

5.3 Extinction: A 2D view of the dust distribution in HCG 31
The values of E(B-V) range from 0 to 0.4. In some spaxels we
detected negative value, which indicates that the coeÔ¨Écient H ùõº/HùõΩ
is below the theoretical value of 2.86. However, this value implies
speciÔ¨Åcconditions( ùëõùëí=100ùëêùëö 2,ùëáùëí=104ùêæ)whichisnotexactly
thecaseforeveryzoneinHCG31(L√≥pez-S√°nchezetal.2004).Thus,
with diÔ¨Äerent conditions, diÔ¨Äerent values of the coeÔ¨Écient H ùõº/HùõΩ
were determined. In these cases, we assumed that the extinction
was null. The highest E(B-V) values were in an H ùõºknot that is
part of member A. The mean values of E(B-V) for each member of
HCG31 are presented in Table 1 col (7) for the map average and
col (8) for the integrated spectra. Our values are consistent, within
the uncertainties, with previous determinations using spectroscopic
data (L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. 2004) or from estimates performed with
the HI density column (Williams et al. 1991). However, our current
analysis signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the spatial coverage of this system.
Objects A1, A2, and A3 show very similar values of E(B-V),
considering their uncertainties. In those regions our values of the
SNRinHùõºandHùõΩarerelativelylow(5-10),andmanyspaxelswith
negative extinction are found, limiting the number of spaxels with
conÔ¨Ådent determinations of E(B-V). Therefore, in these regions we
measuredtheextinctionnearthemostintenseH ùõºknot,maximizing
the SNR and minimizing the uncertainties.
ObjectsAandA+ClieintheregionwiththehighestSNRonour
FoV, because of the overlapping of two MUSE Ô¨Åelds (Ô¨Åelds 1 and 2
on Figure 1). Thus, these objects present the lowest uncertainties in
our E(B-V) determinations.
Object A, in particular, hosts the knot with the highest extinction
on HCG31, with a value of E(B-V) 0¬ï400¬ï06. For A+C the ab-
sorptionislower,anditisspatiallycorrelatedwiththeH ùõºemission.
In the south of A+C, there are several knots with high extinction
(E(B-V)0¬ï4) that are clearly distinguished in Figure 6 (top left
panel).
In object B, the extinctions of its three main knots seem similar,
withB2beingthemostextinguished.Inthisgalaxyweusethesame
procedureasinA1,A2andA3toobtaintheextinction,weaveraged
the E(B-V) values for the points belonging to the peak in H ùõº. It
should be noted that this method only gives us an approximation of
the extinction. The bridge at the NE of this object shows a mean
extinction value of E(B-V) 0¬ï120¬ï08. The two main knots in
object E show similar values of E(B-V), with E2 being the one with
the highest extinction and where the H ùõºemission is strongest. For
themainbodyofE,theextinctionwasE(B-V) 0 0¬ï1.Inmember

5.4 Electron Density
In Figure 7 we show an electron density map, derived from the line

presentedinP√©rez-Montero(2014).TheblackcontoursrepresentH ùõº

In general, electron densities in HCG31 are in the low-density
region(nùëí<100 cm 3),withapeakintheknotslocatedinmembers
AandC.TheknotinmemberAhasanaverageelectrondensityofn ùëí

In all the other members, the electron density remained below 100cm 3. These measurements were consistent with the values known
for extragalactic H /i.pc/i.pcregions (nùëí< 500 cm 3Bresolin et al. 2005).
Several authors have studied the eÔ¨Äects of interaction on electron
density. For example, Krabbe et al. (2014) studied seven pairs of
interactinggalaxiesanddeterminedthatthesesystemsshowedhigher
electron densities (n ùëí= 24-532 cm 3) than isolated galaxies (n ùëí=
40 - 137 cm 3). Our values are consistent with those ranges.
5.5 Oxygen abundance determinations
To have a complete view of the oxygen abundance in HCG31, we
obtained oxygen abundance maps using the strong-line empirical
calibrators,N2andO3N2.Theabundancemapsobtainedwiththese
calibrators are presented on the top right and bottom left panels
of Figure 6, respectively. In addition, in the bottom right panel of
Figure6weshow,thecorrespondingoxygenabundancemapderived
by code HII-CHII-M/i.pc/s.pc/t.pc/r.pc/y.pc .
InFigure6(toprightpanel)theslitsusedtoobtainthemetallicity
gradients of the system are shown (see section 5.6). In this Ô¨Ågure
we observed a slight transition from 12¬∏ùëôùëúùëî¬πùëÇ¬ùùêª¬∫=8¬ï230¬ï16

A. Inspecting Figure 6 (bottom left panel), especially in the central
region of HCG31, we observed a very similar trend, with a more
metallic knot in the south (knot A).
Using GMOS-IFU data, Torres-Flores et al. (2015) studied the
central zone of HCG31, and found a metallicity gradient in the line
thatconnectsthemainburstofstarformationinHCG31AandC.Our

tures (Fig. 6, top right panel). In the southern tidal tail, we used the
same slit as deÔ¨Åned in section 5.1. In galaxy B we split the slit into
two parts to cover the connection between the knots B1, B2 and B3,
including the bridge between B and A+C. The slits had a width of 1
arcsec and we binned the gradients in 1 arcsecs to match the seeing
(seeing1 arcsecs).
The oxygen abundance gradients derived for the diÔ¨Äerent slits
are presented in Figure 8. The data were Ô¨Åtted using the package
/c.pc/u.pc/r.pc/v.pc/e.pc_/f.pc/i.pc/t.pc of/s.pc/c.pc/i.pc/p.pc/y.pc(Virtanen et al. 2020) which allowed us to con-

rameters obtained for the Ô¨Åts are listed in Table 2. Error bars in Fig-

At the top right of Figure 8 we show the dispersion associated with
each calibrator (0.16 dex for N2, red bar; 0.18 dex for O3N2, blue

Inspecting the gradient of galaxy B, we noted a somewhat steep
gradient in the main body of the galaxy , with a peak uncorrelated
with the center of the galaxy. This oÔ¨Äset was about 5 arcsec (1.4
kpc), and it was also observed in the HII-CHI-M/i.pc/s.pc/t.pc/r.pc/y.pc estimates.
For the bridge of galaxy B, which starts at around 17 arcsecs on
Figure 8 (top panel), a quite Ô¨Çat metallicity gradient was observed.
We performed a linear Ô¨Åt on the metallicity distribution of
member B, using the measurements on its main body and bridge
and the results are shown in Table 2. We found a gradient of
ùõº= 0¬ï0120¬ï002¬ªùëëùëíùë•¬ùùëòùëùùëê¬º, with the N2 method, suggesting
a Ô¨Çat oxygen distribution which is expected for a galaxy with inter-
action signatures (Kewley et al. 2010, Rich et al. 2012).
We compared this metal distribution with results obtained for
galaxies NGC4656 and NGC55, which displayed similar morpho-
logical types (SB(s)m, taken from NED) and whose gradients were
studied by Mu√±oz-Elgueta et al. (2018) and Magrini et al. (2017)

B and the southern tidal tail with the diÔ¨Äerent methods
The drop in the central metallicities observed in HCG31 B is an
interesting feature that could be related to gas inÔ¨Çows in the galaxy.
S√°nchezetal.(2014)foundsimilarresultsforsomegalaxiesoftheir
sample. They proposed that in many cases this drop was produced
by the presence of a star formation ring in the nuclear region of the
galaxy. This scenario is diÔ¨Écult to prove in HCG31 B because its
position is nearly edge-on, therefore we cannot discard it. However,
we can speculate that a gas inÔ¨Çow induced by the interaction with
the HCG31 A+C complex is diluting the central metallicities and
triggeringstarformationatthecentralzoneofthisgalaxy,producing
the central drop in the metallicity gradient.
In the bottom panel of Ô¨Ågure 8 we show the oxygen abundance
gradientofthesoutherntidaltail,whichincludesmembersE,Hand
F, and on the top right are represented the associated dispersion of
the empirical calibrators (0.16 dex for N2 and 0.18 dex for O3N2).
The gradient begins at the midpoint between knots A and C (HCG
31 A+C complex) because some authors suggested that this tail was
formed from material detached from galaxy C (Amram et al. 2007).
OnFigure8(bottompanel)weincludetheoxygenabundancedistri-

extends for70 kpc, while the southern tail of HCG 31 starts at 3
kpc and extends about 20 kpc.
Flat oxygen abundance gradients can be explained by gas Ô¨Çows
inducedduringgalaxy-galaxyinteractions(e.gRupkeetal.2010a).
Assuming that was the cause, one would expect to Ô¨Ånd a velocity
gradient through the tidal tail; but, as explained in Section 5.1, the
position-velocity diagram through the southern tidal tail revealed a

These Ô¨Åndings suggested that gas Ô¨Çows could be the explanation of

gas accretion that triggers star formation (Amram et al. 2007) could
be the explanation for its slightly lower metallicity.

by Kennicutt & Evans (2012). In the central zone of the system,
we obtained a total SFR of 2¬ï990¬ï49ùëÄùë¶ùëü 1(Fig. 9, black

mass plane (Atek et al. 2014) we Ô¨Ånd that the system lies at the
locus of galaxies located with redshifts of 0¬ï7¬ü ùëß ¬ü 1¬ï0. This fact
is indicative of the strong episode of starburst that the system is
experiencing, which is similar with respect to the SFRs of galaxies
located at higher redshifts. If we consider the ùêª2mass concentrated

zone of HCG31. The blending of all these lines in the spectra of
a galaxy is the so-called blue bump and it is widely used in the
literature to estimate the number of WN stars in a galaxy (Vacca &
Conti1992,L√≥pez-S√°nchez&Esteban2010).InthecaseofHCG31,
L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. (2004) also detected the blue bump in their
long-slit spectra. In our case, the spectral coverage of our data did

by theùê∂ùêºùëâ5808 √Ö line. In the case of HCG31 this feature is very
weak and diÔ¨Écult to detect. For example, Guseva et al. (2000) and
L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. (2004) did not detect this line in their spectra,
probably because the WR population of this system was dominated
by WN stars (Guseva et al. 2000, L√≥pez-S√°nchez & Esteban 2010).

Nevertheless,inourdatawecandetectthisweakfeatureatthecentral

To map the red bump, we performed a linear Ô¨Åt in the continuum

Using the continuum-subtracted spectra we collapsed the datacube

in the range of 5838 √Ö to 5934 √Ö, producing a 2D image. This map
is shown in Ô¨Ågure 10, where we detected the red bump only in the

We integrated all the spectra of the spaxels seen in Figure 10 and

is important to note that previous studies determined the number
of WCE stars using long-slit spectroscopy instead of integral Ô¨Åeld
spectroscopy; therefore, aperture eÔ¨Äects cannot be neglected.
5.10 Ionization mechanism
We used standard diagnostic diagrams to elucidate the ionization
mechanisms in HCG31. In Figure 11 we show the spatially re-
solveddiagnosticdiagrams,wherethetop,middleandbottompanels

Inspecting the central zone, we found that knot A was in the

etal.2015).However,diÔ¨Äerentregionscanbeobservedalonglineof
sight. Therefore these values of sigma could indicate shocks. Also,
asmentionedinprevioussections,thewidthsthatwemeasuredwere
likely to be overestimated due to multiple unresolved components,
thus the velocity dispersion that we present is an upper limit for
this region. This allowed us to conclude that this knot was ionized
by a combination of shocks and star formation. This scenario was
supported by a high EW(H ùõº), a high Hùõºluminosity (SF evidence)
andthelineratiosobtained(shocks/compositeionizationevidence).
Themainionizationmechanismfortheremaininggalaxiesisthestar

Wealsoincludedacolor-codedpanelforsigmainthethreediÔ¨Äer-
ent BPT diagrams. We did not observe a strong correlation between
theincreaseinvelocitydispersionandthecontributionofshocks,at
least in the sulfur and oxygen diagrams (middle and bottom panels,
respectively). In the BPT diagram using nitrogen, we did observe
a weak correlation between the increase in velocity dispersion and
proximity to the composite zone. This may indicate stronger evi-dence that shocks are contributing signiÔ¨Åcantly to the ionization of
the central region of the system.
5.11 The mass-metallicity relation of HCG 31
It is well established that there is a correlation between the stellar
mass of galaxies and their gas-phase metallicities (Tremonti et al.
2004,Yatesetal.2020).Thiscorrelation,knownasmass-metallicity
relation (MZR), has been widely used to study the formation and
evolution of galaxies. Weilbacher et al. (2003) showed that TDGs
did not follow the MZR, thus, plotting this relation for the mem-
bers of HCG31 and inspecting the positions of the diÔ¨Äerent objects
should give us clues about their formation. Several works studied
theluminosity-metallicityrelationofHCG31forthepurposeofdis-
criminating among the primordial and tidal dwarf galaxies in this
group. Richer et al. (2003) and L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. (2004) stud-
ied the Mùêµvs 12 + log(O/H) relation for this group and Mendes de
Oliveira et al. (2006) studied the M ùêævs 12 + log(O/H) relation. In
the case of the M ùêµvs 12 + log(O/H) relation, the data suggest that
the members, A, B, C and G, are very luminous for their respective
metallicity. This could be explained by the fact that the magnitude
ontheB-bandÔ¨Ålterisprobablycontaminatedbytheluminosityfrom
the star formation processes in the system (L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al.
2004). In contrast, Mendes de Oliveira et al. (2006) posited that the
Mùêævs 12 + log(O/H) relation suggested that members, F1, F2, E2,
A1, H and R, are TDGs or tidal debris.
To plot the MZR for HCG31, we integrated the spectra of nine
diÔ¨Äerent objects: A1, A2, A3, A, A+C, B, E, F1 and F2. We ran
FADOon each spectrum, allowing us to obtain the stellar mass of
each galaxy. The metallicities for each spectrum were based on the
average of N2 and O3N2, and on HII-CHI-M/i.pc/s.pc/t.pc/r.pc/y.pc . The results are
listed in columns (2) and (3) of Table 1. The masses obtained are
listed in column (4) of Table 1. For comparison, we included other
mass estimations derived in previous studies. In column 5 we show
the masses obtained by L√≥pez-S√°nchez & Esteban (2010) for the
diÔ¨Äerent members of HCG31. In column 6 we list stellar masses
derived from the ùêæ ùëèùëéùëõùëëmagnitudes published by Mendes de
Oliveira et al. (2006). In this case we assumed a mass-to-light ratio
foreachmember,basedontheir ùëî0 ùëü0colors(seeBelletal.2003),
and assuming a solar ùëÄùêæ=5¬ï08¬ªùëöùëéùëî¬ºWillmer (2018).

6.1 Abundance gradients and the inÔ¨Çuence of the environment
The metallicity distribution in spiral galaxies has been extensively
studied in recent years (van Zee et al. 1998 Bresolin et al. 2012,
S√°nchez et al. 2014). Most giant galaxies show a clear abundance
gradient, with the center of the galaxy being more metallic than the
outskirts. However, several observational studies have proven that
interacting galaxies show Ô¨Çatter abundance gradients than isolated
galaxies (Kewley et al. 2010, Torres-Flores et al. 2014, Olave-Rojas
etal.2015).NumericalsimulationsshowedthatthisÔ¨Çatteninginthe
gradients was mainly produced by gas inÔ¨Çows towards the nuclear
zones that were triggered by gravitational encounters and mergers
(Torrey et al. 2012). In addition, observational studies have shown
that dwarf galaxies have small abundance gradients or none. (Roy
etal.1996,Hunter&HoÔ¨Äman1999,Croxalletal.2009,Izotovetal.
2006).Pilyuginetal.(2015)foundthatirregulardwarfgalaxiescould
presentanabundancegradientdependingontheirsurfacebrightness
proÔ¨Åle, breaking the spiral vs dwarf dichotomy, which says that spi-
ral galaxies display strong abundance gradients, whereas irregular
dwarf galaxiesdo not. RecentlyJames et al.(2020) usedMUSE ob-
servationsofthedwarfgalaxy,JKB18,anddiscoveredthatithadan
inhomogeneouschemicaldistribution,providingmoreevidencethat
not all irregular dwarf galaxies were chemically homogeneous.
In this paper, we present detailed metallicity maps of the HCG
31 system, based on several strong-line empirical calibrators. The
excellent spatial coverage provided by MUSE allowed us to derive
the metallicity gradient for galaxy B, the southern tidal tail and for
the central zone of the system. In the case of galaxy B, we detected
an almost Ô¨Çat metallicity distribution with a slope of ùõº= -0.012
0.002 dex kpc 1(N2 calibrator), which provided informationabout the chemical homogeneity of this system, with no signiÔ¨Åcant
variations in its metallicity. This Ô¨Ånding is expected for a merging
galaxy (Rupke et al. 2010b).
Aninterestingfeatureinthegradientofthisgalaxywasthecentral
drop in metallicity seen at 5 arcsec. This kind of a decrease seems
to be similar to those detected by S√°nchez et al. (2014) in several
galaxiesintheirsample.However,thoseauthorsfoundnocorrelation
betweenthesedecreasesandinteractionfeaturesinthegalaxies.Here
we propose three diÔ¨Äerent scenarios to explain this central drop in
HCG 31 B.
Amrametal.(2007)foundthattherecedingandapproachingsides

disagreementintherotationcurvewasattheinner5arcsec.Amram
et al. (2007) argued that this inner disagreement might be the sign
of a bar, which could be inducing radial motions of gas that were
Ô¨Çattening the central metallicities. However, it should be noted that

drop in metallicity (S√°nchez et al. 2014). Another possibility is that
thegalaxyiscurrentlyaccretingmetal-poorgas,whichisinducingthe
starburstandproducingthecentraldropinmetallicity.Thisscenario
is unlikely because a galaxy that is accreting material shows a drop
in metallicity of-0.5 dex (S√°nchez-Almeida et al. 2014), and the
centraldropthatwedetectedwas ¬ü-0.2dexregardlessofthemethod
used.Accretionofapartiallyenrichedgasofthegroupcouldexplain

Lastly, one other possibility is that the galaxy hosts a central star-
forming ring which constitutes evidence of radial gas Ô¨Çows induced
byresonanceprocesses.ThisisthescenariothatS√°nchezetal.(2014)
used to explain the central drop in the galaxies of their sample.
However, they did not Ô¨Ånd evidence of signs of interaction or bars
in these galaxies. In our case, galaxy B showed both signs, thus,
we speculated that a combination of the presence of a bar and gas
accretioncouldberesponsibleforthecentralmetallicitydropinthis
galaxy.
A nonphysical explanation could be that the drop is artiÔ¨Åcial and

just a random eÔ¨Äect of the strong line methods used. Indeed, if we
consider the 0.16 dex uncertainties of the strong-line methods the
dropdissapears.WeusedthreediÔ¨Äerentmethodstoplotthegradient

the direct method is required to verify the presence of this central

6.2 ArewewitnessingionizationinducedbyshocksinHCG31?
An interesting region located in the central A+C complex is the
brightest Hùõºknot. This knot is usually referred to as the nucleus
ofgalaxyHCG31A(Torres-Floresetal.2015)anditshowsseveral
interestingproperties.ItistheonlyregionintheentireA+Ccomplex
that seems to be ionized not only by star formation, it shows the
highestelectrondensityandH ùõºemissionoftheentiregroup(Alfaro-
Cuello et al. 2015) and the highest metallicity of the system.
Normally, one expects to Ô¨Ånd low metallicities in HII regions
havinghighH ùõºluminosities,becausethestarburstislikelyfuelledby
aninÔ¨Çuxofmetal-poorgas(S√°nchez-Almeidaetal.2014).However,
wedetectedahighoxygenabundanceforthisregionof 12¬∏ùëôùëúùëî¬πùëÇ¬ùùêª¬∫
= 8.220.19, on average. According to Oey & Kennicutt (1993),
systematic variations in nebular density can lead to diÔ¨Äerences in
metallicities of up to 0.5 dex. This eÔ¨Äect cannot be discarded for
this knot, because it shows the highest electron density in the entire
system with ùëõùëí300 cm 3.
This knot is also the region with the highest oxygen abundance
of the system, and it is well known that WR stars can contribute to
enrichingtheinterstellarmedium(P√©rez-Monteroetal.2013,Kehrig
etal.2013).ToconÔ¨Årmtheexistenceofsuchstarsweintegratedthe
spectrum over a box of 1" 1" centered at knot A. The resulting
spectrum is presented in Figure 13. A characteristic red bump was
observed. Krabbe et al. (2014) proposed that the stellar winds and
masslossofWRstarswerethecauseofoneofthedenserandmetal-
rich HII regions in their sample, a scenario very similar to the case
of this knot.
The velocity dispersion on this knot was 55 km s 1, which
seems to be consistent with shocks ionization(Rich et al. 2015). In
thiscontext,thisvelocitycouldbeexpectedconsideringthelocation
of this knot in the BPT diagram, which lies in the composite zone.A good way to disentangle the ionization mechanism is by using
3Ddiagnosticdiagrams(Kewleyetal.2019).Unfortunately,wecould
not apply this type of diagnostic to our data for two main reasons:
one of the axis of the 3D plot needs the galactocentric radius which
is diÔ¨Écult to determine in a merging system such as HCG31, and
more reliable determinations of the velocity dispersion are needed
toavoidoverestimationsbecauseofthemultiplecomponents.High-
resolution spectroscopic data is needed to rule out the presence of
shocks.
6.3 Unveiling the star formation history of a complex compact
group.
Our new spectroscopic information about HCG31 provides evi-
dences that allow us to uncover the star formation history of this
interacting system.
In order to determine the stellar populations in HCG 31 we ran
FADO over the integrated spectra of each galaxy. Figure 14 shows
theluminosityfractionatthenormalizationwavelength(5100 √Ö)for
each of the SSPs Ô¨Åtted, which illustrates the star formation history
of each galaxy. We showed SFHs only for the galaxies with the best
SNR in the continuum (A+C, A, and B). We also included the SFH
of galaxy F1.
TheSFHoftheA+Ccomplexrevealedthatthepeakofstarforma-
tion occurred from 107yrs to 108yrs ago. We Ô¨Ånd that this age is
consistentwiththedateoftheÔ¨Årstencounter,asreportedbyJohnson
etal.(1999)(400Myrs).Inaddition,thesystemexperiencedanother
starburst event between 106yrs and 107yrs ago, which is com-
pletelyconsistentwiththeagesofthestarformingburstsobtainedin
this work.
The SFH of galaxy A is very similar to that of the A+C complex,
with an important underlying old stellar population at 1 Gyr, an-
other peak at 107yrs to 108yrs and the current star formation event
at 106yrs to 107yrs ago. It should be noted that the SFH of galaxy
A represents only the SFH of the extended body that is seen in the
optical images. It is not a representation of the SFH of the galaxy
HCG31 A as whole. It is not possible to completely separate galax-
iesAandCbecausetheyprobablyoverlapeachother(Amrametal.
2007). For galaxy F1, we found a very interesting aspect in its SFH,
with only two peaks of star formation, one at 108yrs to 109yrs
and the other at about 106yrs. We did not Ô¨Ånd evidence of a very
oldstellarpopulationwithages ¬°1Gyr.Ourresultsareinverygood
agreementwiththephotometricagesoftheSSCsfoundbyGallagher
et al. (2010), who reported no evidence of an old population in this
object.
In summary, all the galaxies of the group display an underlying
stellarpopulationof 1Gyroldandarecurrentlyformingstars.The
Ô¨Årst encounter between HCG31 A and HCG31 C occurred about
400 Myrs ago. Galaxy F1 shows a bimodal age distribution, with
intermediate and young stellar populations.
This type of analysis has also been done for other interacting sys-
tems.Forexample,Buzzoetal.(2021)studiedthestellarpopulations
of the merging system NGC 1487. They found an age distribution
very similar to ours for HCG31, with a peak in the younger popula-
tion which correlates with the current SF episode of the system and
an intermediate population with ages of 1-5 Gyrs.
6.4 Is HCG 31F really a TDG candidate?
Oneofthemostfrequentquestionsintheliteratureaboutthissystem
concerns the nature of object F. In optical images, it appears as a

bright tidal object located in the southern tail of the system. The
photometry of this object was quite uncertain because of contami-
nation from a nearby projected star. In addition, Hunsberger et al.
(1996) did not consider the F galaxy as a TDG candidate although
they did consider the other Ô¨Åve objects (E1, E2, A1, A2 and A3) as
TDG candidates. It is probably that they did not obtain good pho-
tometryonF anddiscardeditfromthe analysis.UsingH ùõºimaging,
Iglesias-P√°ramo & V√≠lchez (2001) proposed that objects F1, F2 and
F3 were the most likely TDG candidates in HCG31, based on their
Hùõºluminosities( ¬°1039ergs s 1)andtheirlargeprojecteddistances
from the parent galaxy. A TDG candidate needs to fulÔ¨Åll two main
conditions (based on Weilbacher et al. 2003): (i) it is quite metallic
foritsmass(outoftheMZR),and(ii)itshowsindependentkinemat-
icsdecoupledfromthetail.ToreachtheÔ¨Årstcondition,manyworks
studied the luminosity-metallicity relation for HCG31 using Ô¨Ålters
ùêµandùêæ(Richer et al. 2003, L√≥pez-S√°nchez et al. 2004, Mendes de
Oliveira et al. 2006). In all these works, objects F1 and F2 showed
high metallicities for their luminosities. In section 5.11 we note that
F1andF2seemedtobeoutofthemainMZRofdwarfgalaxies,and
itiswellestablishedthatobjectFhasatidalratherthanaprimordial
origin.The H ùõºkinematicsof memberFis quitepeculiar, becauseit
shows no rotation in any axis (Amram et al. 2007), and, our radial
velocity map (Section 5.1) conÔ¨Årmed that result. The HI kinematics
of F (Verdes-Montenegro et al. 2005) shows that it is kinematically
decoupledfromthetail,withanaxisofrotationthatisperpendicular
to the axis of the tail, suggesting that this object was already decou-

7 SUMMARY
On this paper we perform a deep analysis of the Hickson Compact
group 31 using IFS data observed with MUSE. We used diÔ¨Äerent
maps for analyzing thekinematics, ionization mechanisms, physical
properties, chemical abundances, SFRs, ages, among others. Our
most remarkable results are:
ThegroupshowsacomplexvelocityÔ¨Åeld,withclearevidences
ofanongoingmergerprocessinthecentralregionbetweenHCG31
A and HCG 31 C galaxies.
The central zone shows the higher velocity dispersions, with
velocities up to90ùëòùëö ùë† 1. These high velocities are spatially
correlated with the merging zone of the system. A more detailed
kinematicsanalysis,thatconsidertheresolvedphysicalpropertiesof

The electron density shows a peak in the central zone of the
system with ùëõùëí300ùëêùëö 3. This peak is associated with a very
