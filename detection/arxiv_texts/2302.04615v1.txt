Abstract
We study some divisibility properties of Dedekind numbers. We show that the
ninth Dedekind number is congruent to 6 modulo 210.
1 Introduction
We deﬁne Dnto be the set of all monotone Boolean functions of nvariables. The cardinality
of this set— dnis known as the n–th Dedekind number. Values of dnare described by the
OEIS(On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequence) sequence A000372 (see Table 1).
In 1990, Wiedemann calculated d8[12]. His result was conﬁrmed in 2001 by Fidytek,
Mostowski, Somla, and Szepietowski [ 3]. The impulse for writing our paper came from
the letter from Wiedemann to Sloane [ 13] informing about the computation of the eighth
Dedekind number, speciﬁcally this fragment: “Unfortunately, I do n’t see how to test it...”.
Wiedemann only knew that d8is even. Despite its obvious importance, there is a lack of
studies on the divisibility of Dedekind numbers. As far as we know, the only paper concerning
this question is Yamamoto’s paper [ 14], where he shows that if nis even, then dnis also
even.
Our research aims to ﬁll this lack by proposing new methods to deter mine the divisibility
of Dedekind numbers. As an application of these methods, we compu te remainders of d9
divided by one-digit prime numbers, which (we hope) will help to verify t he value d9after
its ﬁrst computation.
Our main result is the following system of congruences:
1d9≡0 (mod 2) ,
d9≡0 (mod 3) ,
d9≡1 (mod 5) ,
d9≡6 (mod 7) .
By the Chinese remainder theorem, we have
d9≡6 (mod 210) .
2 Preliminaries
LetBdenote the set {0,1}andBnthe set of n-element sequences of B. A Boolean function
withnvariables is any function from BnintoB. There are 2nelements in Bnand 22n
Boolean functions with nvariables. There is the order relation in B(namely: 0 ≤0, 0≤1,
1≤1) and the partial order in Bn: for any two elements: x= (x1,...,x n),y= (y1,...,y n)
inBn,
x≤yif and only if xi≤yifor all 1≤i≤n.
A function h:Bn→Bis monotone if
x≤y⇒h(x)≤h(y).
LetDndenote the set of monotone functions with nvariables and let dndenote|Dn|. We
have the partial order in Dndeﬁned by:
g≤hif and only if g(x)≤h(x) for all x∈Bn.
We shall represent the elements of Dnas strings of bits of length 2n. Two elements of D0
will be represented as 0 and 1. Any element g∈D1can be represented as the concatenation
g(0)∗g(1), where g(0),g(1)∈D0andg(0)≤g(1). Hence, D1={00,01,11}. Each element
ofg∈D2is the concatenation (string) of four bits: g(00)∗g(10)∗g(01)∗g(11) which can
be represented as a concatenation g0∗g1, whereg0,g1∈D1andg0≤g1. Hence, D2=
{0000,0001,0011,0101,0111,1111}. Similarly, any element of g∈Dncan be represented as
a concatenation g0∗g1, whereg0,g1∈Dn−1andg0≤g1. Therefore, we can treat functions
inDnas sequences of bits and as integers. By /precedesequalwe denote the total order in Dninduced
by the total order in integers. Additionally, we shall write x≺yifx/precedesequalyandx/ne}ationslash=y.
For a set Y⊆Dn, byY2we denote the Cartesian power Y2=Y×Y, that is the set of
all ordered pairs ( x,y) withx,y∈Y. Similarly for more than two factors, we write Ykfor
the set of ordered k-tuples of elements of Y. By⊤we denote the maximal element in Dn,
that is⊤= (1...1); and by ⊥the minimal element in Dn, that is ⊥= (0...0). For two
elements x,y∈Dn, byx|ywe denote the bitwise or; and by x&ywe denote the bitwise and.
Furthermore, re( x,y) denotes |{z∈Dn:x≤z≤y}|. Note that re( x,⊤) =|{z∈Dn:x≤
z}|and re(⊥,y) =|{z∈Dn:z≤y}|.
22.1 Posets
Aposet (partially ordered set) (S,≤) consists of a set Stogether with a binary relation
(partial order) ≤which is reﬂexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. Given two posets ( S,≤)
and (T,≤) a function f:S→Tismonotone , ifx≤yimpliesf(x)≤f(y). ByTSwe
denote the poset of all monotone functions from StoTwith the partial order deﬁned by:
f≤gif and only if f(x)≤g(x) for allx∈S.
In this paper we use the following well-known lemma; see [ 11]:
Lemma 1. The poset Dn+kis isomorphic to the poset DBk
n—the poset of monotone functions
fromBktoDn.
2.2 Permutations and equivalence relation
LetSndenote the set of permutations on {1,...,n}. Every permutation π∈Sndeﬁnes
the permutation on Bnbyπ(x) =x◦π(we treat each element x∈Bnas a function
x:{1,...,n} → { 0,1}). Note that x≤yif and only if π(x)≤π(y). The permutation π
also generates the permutation on Dn. Namely, by π(g) =g◦π. Note that π(g) is monotone
ifgis monotone. By ∼we denote an equivalence relation on Dn. Namely, two functions
f,g∈Dnareequivalent ,f∼g, if there is a permutation π∈Snsuch that f=π(g). For
a function f∈Dnitsequivalence class is the set [ f] ={g∈Dn:g∼f}. Byγ(f) we
denote|[f]|. Form > 1, letEn,m={f∈Dn:γ(f)≡0 (modm)}andEc
n,m=Dn−En,m.
For the class [ f], we deﬁne its canonical representative as the one element in [ f] chosen to
represent the class. One of the possible approaches is to choose it s minimal (according to
the total order /precedesequal) element [ 12]. Sometimes we shall identify the class [ f] with its canonical
representative and treat [ f] as an element in Dn. ByRnwe denote the set of equivalence
classes and by rnwe denote the number of the equivalence classes; that is rn=|Rn|. Values
ofrnare described by A003182 OEIS sequence; see Table 1.

33 Divisibility of Dedekind numbers by 2
In 1952, Yamamoto [ 14] proved that if nis even, then dnis also even. Obviously, the parity
ofd9cannot be checked with this property. However, there are other methods to check it.
One of the possible approaches is by using the duality property of Bo olean functions. For
eachx∈Dn, we have dualxdwhich is obtained by reversing and negating all bits. For
example, 1111d= 0000 and 0001d= 0111. An element x∈Dnisself-dual ifx=xd. For
example, 0101 and 0011 are self-duals in D2. Ifxis not self-dual, and y=xd/ne}ationslash=x, then
yd=x. Thus, non-self-duals form pairs of the form ( x,xd), where x/ne}ationslash=xd. Letkndenote
the number of these pairs and let λndenote the number of self-dual functions in Dn. We
have that dn= 2kn+λn. Hence, λn≡dn(mod 2). Values of λnare described by the OEIS
sequence A001206 ; see Table 2. The last known term of this sequence— λ9was calculated in
2013 by Brouwer et al. [ 1].

4 Divisibility of Dedekind numbers by 3
By Lemma 1, the poset Dn+3is isomorphic to the poset DB3
n—the set of monotone functions
fromB3={000,001,010,100,110,101,011,111}toDn. Consider the function Hwhich for
every triple ( x,y,z )∈D3
nreturns the value
H(x,y,z ) = re(⊥,x&y&z)·/summationdisplay
s≥x|y|zre(x|y,s)·re(x|z,s)·re(y|z,s).
Observe that H(x,y,z ) is equal to the number of monotone functions f∈DB3
nwithf(001) =
x,f(010) = yandf(100) = z. Indeed, for f(000) we can choose any value tsatisfying
4t≤x&y&z, which can be done in re( ⊥,x&y&z) ways. For f(111) we can choose any
element in {s∈Dn:s≥x|y|z}. Furthermore, after the value f(111) =sis chosen, then the
valuesf(011),f(101),f(110) can be chosen independently from each other. We can choos e
a value for f(011) in re( x|y,s) ways; a value for f(101) in re( x|z,s) ways; and a value for
f(110) in re( y|z,s) ways.

The value of His invariant under any permutation of its arguments. Let x,y,z∈Dn
and suppose that x/precedesequaly/precedesequalz. We have the following types of equivalence classes:
1.x=y=z, with one element in class
2.x≺y=z, with three elements in class
3.x=y≺z, with three elements in class
4.x≺y≺z, with six elements in class.
A similar property is exploited by Fidytek et al. [ 3, Algorithm 3] to speed up their
computation of d8. However, they work with a more complex level-4-algorithm. After
applying it to our situation, dn+3can be expressed as the following summation:
dn+3=/summationdisplay
x∈DnH(x,x,x ) + 3·/summationdisplay
x,y∈Dnx≺y(H(x,x,y ) +H(x,y,y )) + 6·/summationdisplay
x,y,z∈Dnx≺y≺zH(x,y,z ) (1)
Thus,
dn+3≡/summationdisplay
x∈DnH(x,x,x ) (mod 3) .
Now we can use one more iteration of symmetry exploitation.

Consider the poset Cpresented in Figure 2. Note that/summationtext

number of functions from the poset CtoDn. LetH′denote the function which for each

H′(u,v,w ) =/parenleftig/summationdisplay
s≤(u&v&w)re[s,u&v&w]/parenrightig
·re[u|v|w,⊤]. (2)
Observe that H′(u,v,w ) is equal to the number of monotone functions h∈DC
nwithh(c) =u,
h(d) =vandh(e) =w. Indeed, for h(f) we can choose any value tsatisfying t≥u|v|w,
which can be done in re( u|v|w,⊤) ways. For h(a) we can choose any element in {s∈Dn:
s≤u&v&w}. Furthermore, after the value h(a) =sis chosen, then the value h(b) can be
chosen in re( s,u&v&w) ways. Hence,
/summationdisplay
x∈DnH(x,x,x ) =/summationdisplay
u,v,w∈DnH′(u,v,w ). (3)
The value of H′is invariant under any permutation of its arguments, so we can use t he same
symmetry–based simpliﬁcation as in Equation 1:
/summationdisplay
u,v,w∈DnH′(u,v,w ) =/summationdisplay

u,v∈Dnu≺v(H′(u,u,v ) +H′(u,v,v )) + 6·/summationdisplay
u,v,w∈Dnu≺v≺wH′(u,v,w ) (4)
Thus, we have
dn+3≡/summationdisplay
u∈DnH′(u,u,u ) (mod 3)
Observe that/summationtext
u∈DnH′(u,u,u ) is equal to the number of monotone functions from the path
P4toDn. Szepietowski [ 11] shows that monotone functions from the path P4= (a < b < c <
6d) to a poset S, are connected to the elements of the array M(S)3=M(S)×M(S)×M(S),
whereM(S) is the array of the poset S. Namely, for i,j∈S, we have M(S)[i,j] = 1 ifi≤j,
andM(S)[i,j] = 0 otherwise. Moreover the sum of elements of M(S)3is equal to |SP4|. For
example, for the poset D1={00<01<11}, we have
M(D1) =
1 1 1
0 1 1
0 0 1

and
M(D1)3=
1 3 6
0 1 3
0 0 1

The sum of the elements of ( M(D1)3) is equal to 15, which is equal to |DP4
1|—the number
of monotone functions from P4toD1.
Furthermore, consider the poset D2={0000,0001,0011,0101,0111,1111}and its array
M(D2) =
1 1 1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 1 1
0 0 0 1 1 1
0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 1

Consider now the array
M(D2)3=
1 3 6 6 14 20
0 1 3 3 9 14
0 0 1 0 3 6
0 0 0 1 3 6
0 0 0 0 1 3
0 0 0 0 0 1

The sum of the elements of ( M(D2)3) is equal to 105, which is equal to |DP4
2|—the number
of monotone functions from P4toD2. In a similar we can compute |DP4n|forn= 3,4,5.
Unfortunately, this method cannot be easily applied for n= 6, because the array M(D6) is
too big. However, Pawelski [ 9] proposes another method: |DP4
(n+m)|=|DP4×Bm
n|=|(DP4n)Bm|
(also see [ 11]). Using the same program as used to compute |DP4
5|[9] we can calculate |DP4
6|
and the result (see Table 3) is divisible by 3.
Corollary 3. As|DP4
6|= 868329572680304346696 is divisible by 3, then also d9is divisible
by 3.
One can directly check that dn+3≡ |DP4n|(mod 3) for n≤5.

5 Counting functions from B2toDn
By Lemma 1, the poset Dn+2is isomorphic to the poset DB2
n—the poset of monotone func-
tions from B2={00,01,10,11}toDn. Consider the function Gwhich for every pair
(x,y)∈D2
nreturns the value G(x,y) = re(x|y,⊤)·re(⊥,x&y). Observe that G(x,y) is equal
to the number of functions f∈DB2
nwithf(01) =xandf(10) =y. Indeed, we can choose
f(11) in re( x|y,⊤) ways and f(00) in re( ⊥,x&y) ways. Note that re( ⊥,x&y) = re(xd|yd,⊤),
wherexdis the dual of x.
ForA⊆Dn×DnletG(A) denote/summationtext
(x,y)∈AG(x,y). By Lemma 1, we have that
dn+2=G(Dn×Dn) =/summationdisplay
x∈Dn/summationdisplay
y∈DnG(x,y).
Observe that, for every permutation π∈Snand every x,y∈Dn, we have G(x,y) =
G(π(x),π(y)). Indeed, z≥x|yiﬀπ(z)≥π(x)|π(y). Hence, re( x|y,⊤) = re(π(x)|π(y),⊤).
Lemma 4. LetYbe a subset Y⊆Dnand suppose that π(Y) =Yfor every permutation
π∈Sn; and let xandybe two equivalent, x∼y, elements in Dn. Then:
1.G({x}×Y) =G({y}×Y).
2.G([x]×Y) =γ(x)·G({x}×Y).
3. ifmdividesγ(x), thenmdividesG([x]×Y)
4.mdividesG(En,m×Y) andG(Y×En,m)
Proof. Notice that condition π(Y) =Yimplies that πis a bijection on Y, or in other words,
πpermutes the elements of Y.

(4) Observe that En,m×Yis a sum of disjoint sets of the form [ x]×Y, whereγ(x) is
divisible by m.
8Lemma 5. For each Y=Dn, [y],En,m, orEc
n,m, and each permutation π∈Sn, we have
π(Y) =Y.
As an immediate corollary, we have that
dn+2=/summationdisplay
x∈Rnγ(x)·G({x}×Dn).
Example 6. Consider the poset D2={0000,0001,0011,0101,0111,1111}. There are ﬁve
equivalent classes: namely, R2={{0000},{0001},{0011,0101},{0111},{1111}}. Two el-
ements: 0101 and 0011 are equivalent. For m= 2, we have E2,2={0011,0101}and
Ec
2,2={0000,0001,0111,1111}.Table 4presents values of G(x,y) forx,y∈D2. Let
Y= [0011] = {0011,0101}. For every permutation π∈S2, we have π(Y) =Y. Fur-
thermore, G({0011}×Y) =G({0101}×Y) = 9 + 4 = 13 ; and G([0011]×Y) = 2·13 = 26,
which is divisible by 2.
Similarly, for Z= [0001] = {0001}, we have that π(Z) =Zfor every permutation π∈S2.
Furthermore, G({0011}×Z) =G({0101}×Z) = 6 ; and G([0011]×Z) = 2·6 = 12, which
is divisible by 2. By summing up all values in Table 4we obtain G(D2×D2) = 168 = d4.

By Theorem 7, we have d4≡70 (mod 2). Indeed, d4= 168, which is even.

In the next two sections, we show that similar techniques can be also applied to functions in

Then:

2.H([x]×Y×Z) =γ(x)·H({x}×Y×Z).

Here, again, we identify each class [ x]∈Rnwith its canonical representative.
Proof. LetA1,A2,A3denoteEn,m×Dn×Dn,Dn×En,m×Dn, andDn×Dn×En,m,
respectively. Observe that

Moreover, we have that mdivides the following numbers:
•H(Ai) fori= 1,2,3

Example 11. Consider D4. There are 168 elements in D4and 30 equivalent classes in R4.
The distribution of these equivalence classes based on their γvalue is presented in Table 5.
For instance, there are six equivalent classes [ x] withγ(x) = 1, two equivalent classes with
γ(x) = 3, and so forth. For m= 2, the set Ec
4,2contains only twelve elements and R4∩Ec
4,2
contains eight elements. Similarly, for m= 3, the set Ec
4,3contains 42 elements and R4∩Ec
4,3
consists of 15 elements.
Example 12. We have utilized a Java implementation of the Theorem 10. Forn= 4 and
m= 2,3,4,6,12 we have:
d7≡2320978352 (mod 2), therefore d7mod 2 = 0,
d7≡74128573428 (mod 3), therefore d7mod 3 = 0,
d7≡128268820802 (mod 4), therefore d7mod 4 = 2,
d7≡89637133284 (mod 6), therefore d7mod 6 = 0,
d7≡566167187562 (mod 12), therefore d7mod 12 = 6,
One can check these values directly by dividing d7by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

7 Counting functions from B4intoDn
By Lemma 1, the poset Dn+4is isomorphic to the poset DB4
n—the set of monotone functions
fromB4toDn. Consider the function F, which for every six elements a,b,c,d,e,f ∈Dn,
gets how many functions g∈DB4
nsatisfy:g(0011) = a,g(0101) = b,g(1001) = c,g(0110) =
d,g(1010) = e,g(1100) = f. Or in other words Fcounts in how many ways we can
choose the values of gfor other elements of B4. Observe that the values for upper elements:
12(1111), (0111), (1011), (1101), (1110) can be chosen indepen dently from the values for lower
elements: (0000), (0001), (0010), (0100), (1000).
Consider now how many ways one can choose the values for the uppe r elements: (1111),
(0111), (1011), (1101), (1110). First, we choose g(1111) witch must be greater or equal
than each of the values a,b,c,d,e,f , sog(1111) can be chosen from the values greater or
equal than a|b|c|d|e|f. Next, if the value of g(1111) is chosen, then the values g(0111),
g(1011),g(1101),g(1110) can be chosen independently from each other. And g(0111) must
be greater or equal than each one of g(0011) = a,g(0101) = b,g(0110) = d. Hence
a|b|d≤g(0111)≤g(1111). Thus g(0111) can be chosen in re( a|b|d,g(1111)) ways (remember
that re(u,v) is the number of elements between uandv). Similarly, the value of g(1011)
can be chosen in re( a|c|e,g(1111)) ways; g(1101) in re( b|c|f,g(1111)) ways; and g(1110) in
re(d|e|f,g(1111)] ways.
The number of ways gcan be extended to the upper elements is equal to
H=/summationdisplay
u≥a|b|c|d|e|fre(a|b|d,u)·re(a|c|e,u)·re(b|c|f,u)·re(d|e|f,u).
Similarly one can show that the number of ways gcan be extended to the lower elements is
equal to
h=/summationdisplay
u≤a&b&c&d&e&fre(u,a&b&c)·re(u,a&d&e)·re(u,b&d&f)·re(u,c&e&f).
Altogether there are F(a,b,c,d,e,f ) =H·hfunctions satisfying: g(0011) = a,g(0101) = b,
g(1001) = c,g(0110) = d,g(1010) = e,g(1100) = f.

Y1×Y2×Y3×Y4×Y5and letπ(y1,...,y 5) = (π(y1),...,π (y5)). Observe that, if π(Yi) =Yi
for every i, thenπ(Y) =Yandπpermutes the elements of Y.
Lemma 13. LetYbe a subset Y⊆D5
nand suppose that π(Y) =Yfor every permutation
π∈Sn; and let xandybe two equivalent, x∼y, elements in Dn. Then:
1.F({x}×Y) =F({y}×Y).
2.F([x]×Y) =γ(x)·F({x}×Y).
3. Ifmdividesγ(x), thenmdividesF([x]×Y).
4.mdividesF(En,m×Y).

the elements of Y.
As a corollary we have

Example 15. We utilized a Java implementation of the Theorem 14. Forn= 4 and
m= 2,3,4,6,12 we have:
d8≡53336702474849828, therefore d8mod 2 = 0,
d8≡3019662424037271148 (mod 3), therefore d8mod 3 = 1,
d8≡25754060568741983624 (mod 4), therefore d8mod 4 = 0,
d8≡14729824485525634108 (mod 6), therefore d8mod 6 = 4,
d8≡15054599294580333880 (mod 12), therefore d8mod 12 = 4,
One can check these values directly by dividing d8by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
148 Application
To compute remainders of d9divided by 5 and 7, we chose the algorithm described in Section
5. Our implementation lists all 490,013,148 elements of R7and calculates γ(x) and re( ⊥,x)
for each element x∈R7. This feat was previously accomplished only by Van Hirtum in 2021
[4]. It is worth noting that the number of elements xinRnwithγ(x) =n! forn >1 can be
found in the OEIS sequence A220879 (see Table 6). Using the available precalculated sets,
we can eﬃciently determine the 7th term of the sequence, which is no t recorded in the OEIS.

Table 6: Inequivalent monotone Boolean functions of nvariables with no symmetries.
Our program’s most critical part, the Boolean function canonizatio n procedure, is based
on fast Van Hirtum’s approach [ 4, Section 5.2.9] and implemented in Rust. Our program is
running on a 32-thread machine with Xeon cores.
After the preprocessed data has been loaded into the main memory , the test was per-
formed and the known value of d8was successfully reproduced in just 16 seconds. However,
using this method to check the divisibility of d9for any value of mis signiﬁcantly more
challenging.
In order to determine which remainders can be computed by our met hods, we can use
the information in Table 7. Note that

by 3, the next step is to compute remainders of d9divided by 5 and 7.

therefore by Theorem 7, we have d9mod 5 = 1. We calculated this number in approximately
7 hours. Moreover, using Theorem 14we haved9≡157853570524864492086 (mod 5), which
conﬁrms that d9mod 5 = 1.

half an hour.
