In this paper, we carry out a detailed investigation of Born- Infeld Electrodynamics in the Car-
rollian limit. We explore these theories by looking at expan sion in a small climit at the level of
Lagrangian. Particularly, we study the symmetries and corr elation functions in the presence of
non-linear interactions.
I.Introduction
Maxwell’s Electrodynamics in four spacetime dimensions
exhibits a remarkable property namely the conformal invari -
ance along with the U(1) gauge symmetry. On top of this,
the corresponding equations of motion are linear in the ﬁeld
strength Fµν. From further studies, it has been conﬁrmed
thatagenericquantumtheoryofElectrodynamicsshouldcon -
tain higher order corrections (arising from the loop contri bu-
tions) to the terms linear in Fµνthat is present in the original
Lagrangian [1]. In the low energy limit, it boils down into th e
pure Maxwell term. This makes us wonder, if there exists
other Lagrangian descriptions for U(1) gauge ﬁelds which are
non-linear in Fµνand boils down to a linear theory as an ef-
fective description. These theories give rise to new physic s
at diﬀerent energy scales. Below, we focus on one particular
example that goes under the name of the Born-Infeld (BI)
theory of Electrodynamics.
Born-Infeld theory is a standard example of non-linear
Electrodynamics1. It was ﬁrst introduced by Max Born and
Leopold Infeld [6–9] to remove the divergences in the elec-
tron’s self-energy in the Maxwell’s theory of Electromag-
netism by introducing an upper bound on the electric ﬁeld
strength at the origin. BI Electrodynamics can also be ob-
tained from string theory in its low energy limit [10–12] as
an expansion in powers of derivatives of gauge ﬁelds. Finall y,
BI theory shows good physical properties such as the wave
propagation as in the case of Maxwell’s theory [13].
In the present paper, we explore the Carrollian limit or
the ultra-relativistic limit of BI Electrodynamics. Carro llian
limit was established in [14, 15] where we take the speed of
light (c) going to zero. This limit is a classic example of what
is known as the ultra local Quantum Field Theories (QFT).
The other extreme corner turns out to be the famous Galilean
limit (c→ ∞). In the language of the causal structure of the
space-time, the Carrollian limit corresponds to the closur e
of the light cone along the time direction. A major eﬀect
of Carrollian limit on the Poincar´ e transformation is that it
considers the space as absolute. Under this framework, the
notion ofcausality completely goes away andtheonlypossib le
way for two events to talk to each other is when they are at
same space and time point. For this reason, Carroll limit
is sometimes referred as the “ultra-local” limit of relativ istic
QFTs.
1Another interesting example of non-linear Electrodynamic s isthe
ModMax Electrodynamics [2–5]. It is the non linear generali sa-
tion of Maxwell’s Electrodynamics that preserves both SO(2)
and conformal invariance.As said before, the Carrollian generators can be obtained
from conformal symmetry generators following a c→0 con-
traction. Taking such ultra-relativistic limit has attain ed
renewed interest during past one decade, where there has
been a signiﬁcant amount of research activities in the area o f
ultra-local QuantumField theories that possess an underly ing
(conformal) Carrollian symmetry as its relativistic confo rmal
counterpart (see [16–20]). Carrollian symmetry has made it s
way into many physical systems including black holes [21, 22 ],
plane gravitational waves [23], condensed matter [24, 25] a nd
also it has been portrayed as the candidate for ﬂat space
holography program [26–29]. On the other hand, the mod-
iﬁed versions of Born-Infeld theories have been hypothesis ed
to be used in tachyon cosmology [30].
The purpose of the present article is to explore the Car-
rollian limit of BI Electrodynamics in the electric sector b y
taking the small cexpansion at the level of action [31]. In
particular, we study the symmetries and the correlation fun c-
tions in the presence of non-linear interactions.
The organisation for the rest of the paper is as follows:
•In Section 2, we obtain the Carrollian limit of Born-
Infeld (CBI) Electrodynamics in small cexpansion.
•In Section 3, we investigate the symmetries of CBI
Electrodynamics in the electric limit and compute the
2-point correlation between the components of U(1)
gauge ﬁelds.
•In Section 4, we discuss the symmetries of CBI theory
at an arbitrary order in the BI coupling.
•Finally, in Section 5, we conclude along with some fu-
ture directions.
II.Carrollian limit of Born-Infeld Electrodynamics
We explore the Carrollain limit of BI Electrodynamics in
the electric limit in four-dimensional space-time in small c
expansion.
Born-Infeld Electrodynamics is a non-linear extension of
the standard Maxwell Electrodynamics [6–9]. This theory
aimed to cure the divergences in the electric ﬁeld self-ener gy
of the electron. In order to obtain the ﬁnite self-energy of a
charged particle, the authors in [6] put an upper bound on
the electric ﬁeld at the origin and derive the Lagrangian fro m
the general invariance principle. The BI Lagrangain is give n
below

wherebis theBIcouplinghavingthedimensionofenergyden-
sity and Fµν=∂µAν−∂νAµis the standard electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor.
Alternatively, one can also express the above Lagrangian
density ( 1) in the following form [32]

(2) reduce to the standard Maxwell Electrodynamics.
Using the Lagrangian density ( 2), one can estimate the
upperboundon the electric ﬁeldbydemandingthe expression
inside the square root to be a positive quantity [33]. It turn s
out that the maximum allowed value of the electric ﬁeld is of
the order of BI coupling ( b).
Later, it was found that the BI action emerges as an ef-
fective low-energy action in the open bosonic string theory
[11]. Moreover, in the context of type II superstring theori es,
the BI action eﬀectively describes the D-branes world volum e
theory in 10 space-time dimensions, where the BI coupling is
related to the brane tension [34].
Wewill nowmoveontolookatthesymmetriesofBIaction.
It is noteworthy to mention that the BI Lagrangian ( 2) is
invariant under the gauge and Poincare transformations
δGAµ(x) =∂µα(x), δP
µAν(x) =∂µAν(x), (3a)
δL
µνAρ(x) = (xµ∂ν−xν∂µ)Aρ(x)+ηρµAν(x)−ηρνAµ(x).(3b)
However, if we try to look into the invariance of ( 2) under the
conformal extension of Poincare algebra that includes scal e
(D) and special conformal transformations ( Kµ). The trans-
formations are given by
δDAµ(x) = (xν∂ν+∆)Aµ, (4a)
δK
µAν(x) = (2xµxτ∂τ−x2∂µ+2∆xµ)Aν
−2(xνAµ−ηµνxτAτ),(4b)
where ∆is thescalingweight oftheﬁeldsunderconsideratio n.
It is not invariant under the scale and the special conformal
transformations. It concludes that the relativistic Born- Infeld
theory is only invariant under Poincare transformations an d
not under its conformal extension.
Next, we study the small cexpansion at the Lagrangian
level. In other words, we ﬁrst have to expand the relativisti c
Lagrangian in cand then take the c→0 limit in order to get
the Carrollian version. Moreover, it is technically challe nged
to investigate the symmetries of CBI Electrodynamics for a
general value of BI coupling dueto the presence of square roo t
in the Lagrangian density ( 2). Therefore, we will study the
symmetries of the theory perturbatively in the BI coupling
(equivalently, in large blimit). In the large blimit, the above
Lagrangian density ( 2) boils down2

Now we make an expansion of the Lagrangian density ( 5)
aroundc= 0. The components of gauge ﬁelds can be ex-
panded around c= 0 as follows

as Carrollian Born Infeld (CBI) Electrodynamics. Further-
more, the superscripts ( E) and (M) inLMaxwellandLBI(11)
respectively denotes the Lagrangian in the electric and mag -
netic limit. It should be noted that the electric limit appea rs
at the leading term in ( 11), where the magnetic eﬀects start
appearing at the sub-leading term (coeﬃcient of c2). For the
present purpose, we focus only on the electric limit.

tained by varying the Lagrangian density ( 10) with respect

III.Symmetries and Correlation functions
In this Section, we discuss the symmetries of the CBI Elec-
trodynamics in the electric limit and using the symmetries o f
the theory, we will compute the correlation functions betwe en
the components of U(1) gauge ﬁelds.3
A.Symmetries
In this Section, we discuss the invariance of the CBI ac-
tion (11) under the Carrollian generators and its conformal
extensions.
The Carrollian generators includes translations ( Pi,H), ro-
tations ( Jij), boosts ( Bi) and its conformal extensions con-
tains scale transformation ( D), special conformal transforma-
tions (K,Ki). Together they form what we call as ﬁnite Con-
formal Carrollian algebra (fCCA). It is also possible to giv e a
lift to the ﬁnite CCA. In place of ﬁfteen generators, we will
now have inﬁnite number of generators and still the CCA will
close among itself. We call it as inﬁnite dimensional CCA.
For this paper, we are interested in d= 4 case only. The
inﬁnite extension was proposed only in the supertranslatio n
part [35]:
Mm1,m2,m3=xm1ym2zm3∂t, (18)
wherem1,m2,m3are integers. These generators correspond
to the time translation generators with arbitrary spatial d e-
pendencies. The ﬁnite parts of supertranslations are given by:
H=M0,0,0, Bx=M1,0,0, By=M0,1,0, Bz=M0,0,1,(19a)
K=M2,0,0+M0,2,0+M0,0,2. (19b)
The inﬁnite dimensional CCA (I-CCA) will include the ﬁnite
part along with the supertranslations ( M). The Carrollian
transformations on the gauge ﬁelds can be found by taking
the Carrollian limit directly on ( 3) and (4).
The CBI action ( 11) is completely invariant under transla-
tions (δP≡∂i,δH≡∂t) and rotations ( δJ≡(xi∂j−xj∂i+
Sij), where Sijis thespinmatrix. UndertheCarrollian boost,
the components of gauge ﬁeld transform as [31]
δA(n)
t=/vector g./vector x∂tA(n)
t+t/vector g.∂tA(n−1)
t+/vector g.A(n−1)
t,(20a)
δA(n)
i=/vector g./vector x∂tA(n)
i+giA(n)
t+t/vector g.∂A(n−1)
t,(20b)
where/vector gis the Carroll boost parameter and ncan take values
either 0 or 1.
Using (20a) and (20b), it is now quite straight forward to
checkthattheLagrangian ( 11)in theelectric limit is invariant
under the Carrollian boost (up to total derivative). Moreov er,
theequationsofmotion ( 16)-(17)also remainsinvariantunder
(20a)-(20b).
Next, we explore thevariation of ( 11) underthe scale trans-
formation ( D). The components of gauge ﬁeld ( Ai,At) and
the ﬁeld strength under dilatation ( D) are given by
δDAK= (t∂t+xk∂k+∆)AK, (21)
whereK=t,i. Notice that, the electric piece of the La-
grangian ( 11) is not invariant under the scale transformation
(21), rather it turns out to be
δD/parenleftBig
L(E)
Maxwell+L(E)
BI/parenrightBig

2b2/parenleftBig
E(0)
i/parenrightBig4
,(22)
which vanishes in the strict b→ ∞limit. This is what we
expect from the standard Carrollian Electrodynamics [31].
Under the temporal component of special conformal trans-
formation ( K) and Carrollian supertranslations ( Mm1,m2,m3)
given by
δMAt=xm1ym2zm3∂tAt, (23a)
δMAl=xm1ym2zm3∂tAl+∂l/parenleftbig
xm1ym2zm3/parenrightbig
At,(23b)the action ( 11) remains invariant. On the other hand, it is not
invariant under the spatial component of special conformal
generators ( Kj):
δKjAt= (2∆xj+2xjt∂t+2xixj∂i−xixi∂j)At,(24a)
δKjAl= (2∆xj+2xjt∂t+2xixj∂i−xixi∂j)Al
+2δjlxiAi−2xlAj+2tδljAt.(24b)
B.Correlation functions
Inthis Section, we computethe 2-point correlation between
the diﬀerent components ( At, Ai) of the U(1) gauge ﬁeld in
the electric limit. In order to compute these correlation fu nc-
tions, we use the symmetry generators in the Carrollian BI
limit that preserve the structure of the action up to leading
order (LO) in the BI coupling.
Before proceeding further, it is customary to discuss the
algorithm to compute the 2-point correlation function base d
on [17]. Firstly, we demand that the vacuum state ( |0/angbracketright) be
invariant under all symmetry operators ( O). Here, Ocollec-
tively denotes the temporal and spatial translations ( H,Pi),
rotation ( Jij), boost ( Bi), temporal special conformal trans-
formation ( K) and Carrollian supertranslations ( Mm1m2m3).
The invariance of the vacuum state under symmetry oper-
ators (O) implies that O|0/angbracketright= 0 and /angbracketleft0|O= 0. Using this
fact, one can write down the master equation for computing
the 2-point correlation [17]
/angbracketleft0|[O,f(t1,x1)]g(t2,x2)|0/angbracketright+/angbracketleft0|f(t1,x1)[O,g(t2,x2)]|0/angbracketright= 0,
(25)
wheref(t,x) andg(t,x) represent the components of gauge
ﬁeld (At, Ai). Now, one can easily solve the above diﬀeren-
tial equations ( 25) for various symmetry generators ( O) and
obtain the required correlation functions.
We now move on to estimate all the possible correlation
functions in the Carrollian Born-Infeld limit.
•Case I : Correlation between At(x1,t1) andAt(x2,t2)
The 2-point correlation between the temporal components
of the gauge ﬁeld is deﬁned as
G(E)
00(t1,t2,x1,x2)≡ /angbracketleftAt(t1,x1)At(t2,x2)/angbracketright.(26)
Notice that, the invariance under temporal and spatial tran s-
lation implies that G(E)
00can only depend on the diﬀerence
between the coordinates i.e. τ=t1−t2andri=xi
1−xi
2.
Using this fact and using the boost operator in equation ( 25),
one ﬁnds
ri∂τG(E)
00= 0. (27)
Equation ( 27) suggests that G00can at most depend on
ri. However, one can further reﬁne the form of G(E)
00by re-
quiring that the correlation functions must be invariant un der
rotation, which yields
G(E)
00=c0r2, (28)
wherec0is an arbitrary constant and r2=r2
1+r2
2+r2
3.
Finally, it is straightforward to check that the other
symmetry operators i.e. temporal special conformal trans-
formation ( K) and Carrollian supertranslations ( Mm1m2m3)4
also produce the same result.
•Case II : Correlation between At(x1,t1) andAi(x2,t2)
Two pointcorrelation betweenthe temporal andthespatial
component of the gauge ﬁeld can be expressed as
G(E)
0i(t1,t2,x1,x2)≡ /angbracketleftAt(t1,x1)Ai(t2,x2)/angbracketright.(29)
Similartothepreviouscase, thetemporalandspatialtrans -
lation invariance demand that G(E)
0ican only depend on τand
ri. Furthermore, the boost symmetry implies that
rl∂τG(E)
0i+δliG(E)
00= 0. (30)
Now we solve the above equation ( 30) for diﬀerent values
oflandi. Notice that, for l= 1 and i= 2, we ﬁnd G(E)
02=
F1(ri). However, for l=i= 2, we obtain
G(E)
02=−c0r2
r2τ+F2(ri). (31)
Inordertoobtain auniquesolution/parenleftBig
G(E)
02/parenrightBig
, we mustthere-
fore setc0= 0 together with F1(ri) =F2(ri) =F(ri). Set-
ting,c0= 0 implies that the correlation between the temporal
components of gauge ﬁeld/parenleftBig
G(E)
00/parenrightBig
must vanish in the electric
limit.
The rotational symmetry further restricts the form of G(E)
0i
as follows
G(E)
0i=cir2, (32)
whereci,i= (1,2,3) are the constants. It is now straight-
forward to check that the temporal special conformal
transformation ( K) and the Carrollian supertranslations
(Mm1m2m3) also lead to the same conclusion.
•Case III : Correlation between Ai(x1,t1) andAj(x2,t2)
The two point correlation between the spatial components
of gauge ﬁeld is deﬁned as as
G(E)
ij(t1,t2,x1,x2)≡ /angbracketleftAi(t1,x1)Aj(t2,x2)/angbracketright.(33)
Like before, the temporal and spatial translation invarian ce
restrict the dependencies of G(E)
ijonly toτandri. Moreover,
the invariance of G(E)
ijunder the boost symmetry requires
that
rl∂τG(E)
ij+δliG(E)
0j+δljG(E)
i0= 0. (34)
Next, we solve the above equation ( 34) for diﬀerent values
ofl,iandj. First, we consider a case with l= 1,i= 2,j= 3.
For, these values of ( l,i,j), we ﬁnd G23=K1(ri). On the
other hand, for the choice l=i= 2,j= 3, we obtain
G(E)
23=−c3r2
r2τ+K2(ri). (35)
In order to obtain a unique solution of the correlation func-
tionG23, we must therefore identify the function K1(ri) with
K2(ri) and set, c3= 0. Similarly, one can check that unique-
ness of the other correlation function i.e. G(E)
12andG(E)
31re-
quires to set c2=c1= 0. In other words, the two point
correlation between the temporal and spatial components of
the gauge ﬁeld must vanish in the electric limit.Finally, the rotational symmetry reﬁnes the form of the
correlation function G(E)
ijas
G(E)
ij=cδijr2, (36)
wherecis an arbitrary constant. One can also reach the same
conclusion ( 36) using thetemporal special conformal transfor-
mation ( K) and Carrollian supertranslations ( Mm1m2m3).
Notice that the correlations between the components of the
U(1) gauge ﬁeld grow as Gij∼r2, wherermeasures the spa-
tial separation between two points. On the other hand, in
the conformal Carrollian Electrodynamics, it is inversely pro-
portional to the distance of separation i.e. Gij∼r−2, which
reﬂects the scale invariance of the theory in the Carrollian
limit. Moreover, the theory is ultra-local therefore rcannot
be arbitrarily large.
IV.Comments on higher order corrections
In this Section, we discuss the symmetries of the CBI Elec-
trodynamics (in electric limit) at nthorder in the BI coupling/parenleftbig

Next, we expand the above Lagrangian density ( 37) around
c= 0 using the gauge ﬁelds expansions ( 8) and (9), which
yields

It is now quitestraightforward tocheck that the action ( 38)
as well as the equations of motion ( 39) remain invariant under
theK,Bl, andMtransformations up to total derivative. For
example, under the action of boost Bl, the above equation
(39) transforms as

which vanishes identically. Therefore, we conclude that th e
CBI Electrodynamics in the electric limit is invariant unde r
K,Bl, andMtransformations for all orders in the BI cou-
pling. Similarly, one can also explore the symmetries of the
CBI Electrodynamics in magnetic limit. We leave this excit-
ing direction for future investigations.
V.Conclusion and future direction
Wenowsummarise thekeyﬁndingsof ouranalysis and out-
line some exciting projects down the line. We explore small c5
expansion at the level of the Lagrangian [31]. We then look
into the Carrollian symmetries and ﬁnd that the electric lim it
of Born-Infeld Electrodynamics is completely invariant. T he
surprising result is that the theory is invariant under supe r-
translations ( Mm1,m2,m3). Finally, we see howthe correlation
functions looks in the Carrollian limit for Born-Infeld Ele ctro-
dynamics.
Below, we outline some further directions that might be
worth pursuing in the future.
•It would be nice to explore the “similar feature” in the
Carrollian limit of supersymmetric version of Born-Infeld the-
ory and in particular, one can investigate the connection of
this theory with tensionless limit [36–41] of string theory .
•It would be an interesting project to study the “similar
feature” in the Carrollian gravity coupled with the BI theor y.
In particular, the authors in [42] consider a Carroll gravit y
coupled with Maxwell Electrodynamics and construct variou s
solutions, including the wormholes, black hole solutions e tc.,
and examine the geodesic structure in the Carrollian limit.
Therefore, it would be nice to explore the possible deviatio ns
in the presence of BI interactions in the theory.
