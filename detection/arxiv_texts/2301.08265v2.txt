dense molecular clouds release energetic feedback and momentum
into their surroundings, which then influences the subsequent evo-
lution of the galaxy by setting the equilibrium disc structure and
depletion time.
Acrucialcomponentinthisphasemattercycleisthecoldneutral
medium or CNM. This consists of the neutral atomic hydrogen (H i)
withtemperaturesaround 100K(Kulkarni&Heiles1987;Dickey&
Lockman1990)thatmakesupthebulkoftheneutralgasingalaxies,
alongsidethewarmneutralmedium(WNM)whichhastemperatures
of order 104K. These atomic phases exist together in pressure equi-
librium such that they can be considered as a two-phase medium
(Fieldetal.1969;Wolfireetal.2003;Bialy&Sternberg2019).Itis

molecularcloudswherestarsareborn(e.g.McKee&Ostriker2007;

pre-conditionforstarformationingalaxies,anddeterminingitsdis-
tribution is crucial for any theory of galaxy evolution. In this paper,
we seek to use numerical models to investigate the broad trends of
where the CNM is located in galaxies, what sets this distribution,
and how it corresponds to star formation.
The phases of the ISM are usually explained in terms of pres-
sure equilibrium (Field et al. 1969; McKee & Ostriker 1977). As
summarised by Ostriker & Kim (2022), the midplane pressure is
in vertical dynamical equilibrium with the weight of the ISM. This

backinsettingthisdiscpressure.Similarly,theexistenceofthecold
neutral gas phase should also be related to the local pressure envi-
ronment. Wolfire et al. (2003) have shown that there is a minimum

continuum sources since the emission is dominated by the warm
phase. Using the Millenium Arecibo 21 cm absorption line survey,
Heiles & Troland (2003) found that in the solar neighbourhood the
CNM component makes up about 40%of the neutral gas, whereas
more recently Murray et al. (2018) estimated the CNM was 28%of
thetotalH ibutthat 20%oftheH iwasinathermallyunstablephase.
Dickey et al. (2009) combined multiple 21 cm emission surveys
of the galactic plane to deduce that the CNM in the Milky Way
was similarly located to the WNM. Moreover, recent work with the
Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) by Dickey
etal.(2022)foundthatintheinnerMilkyWay,theCNMhasasimilar
scale height to the molecular gas, but in the outer galaxy the CNM
andWNMarewellmixedandmaintainaconstantCNM/WNMratio
out to radii of at least 40 kpc. Similarly, Strasser et al. (2007) found
CNM at large galactocentric radii in spiral arms in the outer galaxy.
Soler et al. (2022) investigated the filamentary structure in the H i
emission toward the Galactic disk using a Hessian matrix method.
The identified filamentary structures correspond to roughly 80% of
the H iemission and most likely consist of CNM material due to
their higher density. The mean scale height of the filamentary H i,
was lower than that of the total H iin the outer galaxy, suggesting
that the CNM and WNM have different scale heights in this regime.
These results are at odds with the aforementioned pressure equilib-
riummodels,whichsuggestthatinthelow-pressureenvironmentof
the outer galaxy, the CNM phase should become increasingly less
prevalent (Wolfire et al. 2003).
Another way of probing the CNM phase is through the [C ii] 158
ùúám emission line, as this is the main coolant of the diffuse ISM. As

studiestheseauthorsfoundthattheCNMcolumndensitydecreased
more rapidly with galactocentric radius than that of the WNM, and
consequently, the fraction of the atomic gas in the cold phase was
much lower in the outer galaxy ( ‚àº20%).
The distribution of the neutral atomic medium is something that
has not just been a focus of observational studies, but is also a topic
of interest for theoretical numerical studies. In cosmological simu-
lations, resolving the scale height of the H igas is a key challenge
for reproducing Milky Way type galaxies (e.g Hopkins et al. 2018).
Previously, the H iscale heights of simulated galaxies were of order
ofkiloparsecs(Bah√©etal.2016;Marinaccietal.2017),howeverre-
centFIREbox (Gensior et al. 2022) simulations have more realistic
heights of‚àº100pc in the galactic centres, rising to ‚àº800pc in the
outer galaxy. The authors postulate that the solution to faithfully re-

multiphase medium with cold gas and small scale stellar feedback.

and even FIREbox has a mass resolution of over 6√ó104ùëÄ‚äô. To
obtain a finer description of the CNM, therefore, simulations of gas
in an isolated galaxy are needed.

2 METHODS
2.1 Isolated Galaxy Simulations
Our simulations are carried out using the Arepocode (Springel
2010) with custom physics modules to describe star formation and
colddensegas.Forafulldescriptionofournumericalsetup,seeTress
et al. (2020). However, we briefly summarise the major features and
differences from previous work here.
The models of Tress et al. (2020, 2021) consist of two simula-
tions of a galaxy disc consisting of dark matter halo ( 6√ó1011M‚äô),
bulge ( 5.3√ó109M‚äô), stellar disc ( 4.77√ó1010M‚äô), and gas disc
(5.3√ó109M‚äô). The first model is isolated and develops large scale

tion of strong spiral arms. For our analysis, we focus on an updated
versionoftheIsolatedcaseasthisbestlendsitselftoradialaveraging.
However, in Section 4.4 we will revisit the latter Interacting model.
The original simulation assumed a constant interstellar radia-
tion field consistent with the solar neighbourhood value ùê∫0=1.7
in Habing units (Draine 1978; Habing 1968). However, this is not a
good description of the outer galaxy where the field will be lower
due to the low star formation rate. To account for this we computed
the time-averaged radial star formation rate surface density profile
from 280to320MyrintheoriginalTressetal.(2020)modelduring
thesteadystateperiodofthegalaxy.Wethenfitanexponentialfunc-
tion to the star formation density and scale it such that, at the radius
where the star formation rate surface density is equal to the solar
neighbourhood value, it takes the value of ùê∫0. The final expression
takes the form
ùê∫=ùê∫0exp(‚àí(ùëÖ‚àíùëÖ0)/1.047), (1)

radiationfield.(Wecheckedsubsequentlythatthestarformationrate
was not significantly different in the new runs with varying field.)
Shielding from the field is computed assuming a constant shielding

alsoassumethatthemeanfreepathoftheFUVphotonsintheMilky

this is a reasonable assumption out to galactocentric radii of 10 kpc
in the Milky Way (Wolfire et al. 2003) but may be less valid in the
outer galaxy. Nonetheless, while this is an approximation, it is far
better than assuming a constant value for the interstellar radiation
field. Cosmic ray ionisation is also included at a constant rate of
ùúÅùêª=3√ó10‚àí17s‚àí1for atomic hydrogen, with the rates for other
chemicalspecies(H 2,He,etc.)scaledappropriately.However,inthe

thenetworkforhydrogenchemistryfirstpresentedinGlover&Mac
Low (2007a,b). A simplified description of CO formation and de-
structionisalsoincludedinthisnetwork,basedonNelson&Langer
(1997). However, we do not analyse CO in this work.
For simplicity, we assume that the gas has solar metallicity
throughout our simulated galaxy and that the dust-to-gas ratio is
thesameasinthesolarneighbourhood.Inreality,theMilkyWayhas
ametallicitygradientofapproximately ‚àí0.037 dex kpc‚àí1(Arellano-
C√≥rdova et al. 2020), and similar results are found in other nearby
spiralgalaxies(seee.g.Kreckeletal.2019).Therefore,inoursimu-
lation,thegasintheoutergalaxy( ùëÖ>12kpc)isroughly2‚Äì3times

Way-type spiral galaxy. However, this will have only a minor effect
on the temperature of the atomic ISM, since the dominant cooling
andheatingprocesseshavethesamedependenceonmetallicity,pro-
vided that the dust-to-gas ratio scales linearly with the metallicity
(Wolfire et al. 1995).The resolution of the simulations depends on two criteria. Firstly
we set a target gas mass of 300 ùëÄ‚äô, which means that by default
arepowill refine or de-refine the grid so as to keep the masses of
all of the grid cells within a factor of two of this value. However, on

of10‚àí22<ùúå< 10‚àí21gcm‚àí3, which equates to spatial scales of a
parsec or smaller. We are therefore confident that the CNM is well
resolved.
Starformationismodeledviasinkparticles(Bateetal.1995;Fed-
errath et al. 2010), which are non-gaseous particles that represent
collapsing regions of gas that will form small (sub)clusters of stars.

As star formation is still inefficient at these scales we assume a 5%
star formation efficiency (Evans et al. 2009) and associate a stellar
and gas fraction to each sink.
Using the model of Sormani et al. (2017), we sample the IMF
and associate supernovae with the massive stars as described by
Tress et al. (2020). For each supernova, we calculate an injection
radius, which is the radius of the smallest sphere centred on the
supernova that contains at least 40 grid cells. If the injection radius
is smaller than the expected radius of a supernova remnant at the
end of its Sedov-Taylor phase, we inject thermal energy from the
supernova; otherwise, we inject momentum (e.g. Gatto et al. 2015).
Mass is returned with each supernova explosion such that when the
lastsupernovaoccursthegaseouscomponentofthesinkisexhausted.
The sink is then turned into a star particle. To account for type
Ia supernovae, we also randomly select a star particle every 250
years and create a supernova event at its position (based on the star
formationhistoryofM51,asquantifiedbyEufrasioetal.2017,which
is similar to our model).

a smooth averaging procedure on the original simulations to inves-
tigate if choosing a single snapshot in time biased the result. We
found that the radial profile followed an identical trend radially but
with a smoother shape. However, the averaging process masked real

in two different ways. Firstly, we bin the data in cylindrical co-
ordinates in order to study whether the CNM fraction varies with
galactocentricradius.Weuse60binslinearlyfromaninnerradiusof
0.1kpc to an outer one of 15kpc. In the Isolated galaxy simulation,
the star formation is mostly contained within a radius ‚àº10kpc and

the material within a vertical extent of 1.5kpc of the disc midplane.
Secondly, we use a vertical binning scheme where we bin the
data in radius and vertical extent rather than angle. The same radial

withtheCNMfeaturesidentifiedinabsorptionbyHeiles&Troland
(2003). (Although it should be noted that the majority of the gas in
the CNM phase is much colder than this.) The CNM fraction ùëìùê∂is
taken to be the mass of cold H iwithùëá<200K divided by the total
Himass in the bin. The H isurface density Œ£HIis then simply the
total H imass divided by the area of the bin. The exact choice of
temperature threshold chosen for the CNM definition makes only a
small( 10‚àí20%)differencetotheresults.Forexample,whentesting
we found the total CNM fraction for the galaxy to be 0.164with a
thresholdof150K, 0.192with200K,and 0.227for300K.The200
K threshold is consequently a reasonable compromise, and has the
advantage of being consistent with the observational literature.

at which point their pressure would no longer be reflective of the

of the cell. We divide ùëÉùëßbyùëòùêµfor comparison with the thermal
pressure.
To investigate the scale height of the H iand CNM we use our
vertically binned data and fit a Gaussian as was recently done by
Bacchini et al. (2019) for THINGS galaxies, using the equation
ùëõùëó=ùëõ0exp‚àí(ùëß2

whereùëõùëóis the number density in the bin, ùëõ0the number density at
the midplane, ùëßùëóthe distance from the midplane, and ùêªùëßthe scale
height. The fit is performed using the scipycurve_fit routine. As
a second check of the vertical extent we also calculate the mass-
weightedùëßposition and its dispersion, in each of our radial bins to
investigate local variations.
As discussed in Section 2.1 the simulation uses the sink particle
method to track the amount of mass going into bound collapsing
regions. We use these to find the growth rate of the stellar mass in
each sink. To calculate this we compare the analysed time snapshot
withtheprevioussnapshotcreatedbythesimulation.Ifasinkhasno

we take the difference between the stellar masses to calculate how it

of the H ialso changes between the star-forming disc and the outer

it follows the arms more closely. In Figure 4 we show the CNM

until values of ùëìùê∂‚àº0.8. The distribution is similar to the Arecibo
survey of Heiles & Troland (2003) but, as in that survey, a single

in the outer galaxy as expected from observations (e.g. Yim et al.
2014; Bacchini et al. 2019; Randriamampandry et al. 2021; Soler
et al. 2022) The distribution is noisy due to the spiral structure but
the two populations follow each other closely. However, at 12 kpc
theydivergeduetotheCNMdisappearingfromthegasphase.Unlike
the H i, the CNM scale height does not flare.
To investigate whether this behaviour is due to averaging we in-
vestigate another metric which does not depend on a fit. Figure 10
shows radial profiles and angular maps of the mass-weighted mean
ùëßposition and its dispersion. While the mean ùëßposition is always
close to the 0 position in the simulation there are variations of up
to 50% of the scale height in Figure 9. The CNM‚Äôs mean vertical
position closely follows that of the full H idistribution, but the dis-
persion shows very different behaviour. In the galaxy centre both
the total H iand the CNM have very low scale heights ( ‚àº50pc).
However, while the dispersion of the total H igas steadily rises, the
CNMremainstightlyconfinedbelowvaluesof100pc.Notethatthis

(5)whereŒ£SFRis in units of M ‚äôpc‚àí2yr‚àí1andùëÉùëá/ùëòùêµin units of
cm‚àí3K. This follows the same trend as the scaling of our models
confirming that the total midplane pressure plays a major role in
settingtheglobalstarformationrate.Thenormalisationofourmodel
is different, however it should be noticed that our treatment of star
formation, using sink particles, is different from the star particle
approach of Kim et al. (2013) who assume a constant efficiency per
free fall time and this may account for the discrepancy. However,
the observational results of Sun et al. (2020) are in good agreement
with Kim et al. (2013) so further investigation may be needed. We
also considered the volume-weighted pressure relation and found it
hadsimilarscalingbehaviourbuttherewasadiscontinuousjumpin
Œ£SFRat high stellar densities. This is most likely due to the small
volume fraction of dense star-forming regions. For this reason we
consideronlymass-weightedpressuresgoingforward.Regardlessof
how calculated, the dispersion in the relationship decreases at large
star formation rate surface densities as high pressures are needed to
create sufficient dense gas.
In Figure 12 we investigate how the total mass-weighted pressure
corresponds to the CNM and star formation. The left panel shows
the mass-weighted total pressure vs the CNM surface density. The
dashed line shows a line with gradient of 0.6, which matches the
upperenvelopeofthedata.Thereisalargeamountofscatter,butthe
CNMcolumndensityincreaseswithpressureaswouldbeexpected.
The middle panel of Figure 12 shows the star formation surface
density plotted against the CNM surface density in a manner analo-
goustoaKennicutt-Schmidtrelation(Kennicutt1998).Observation-
ally, the star formation density scales with a power of ‚àº1.4against
the total gas surface density (H i+H2), as shown, for example, in
de los Reyes & Kennicutt (2019). However, when compared to only
molecular gas, the scaling is linear down to at least 0.1solar metal-
licity (Bigiel et al. 2008; Whitworth et al. 2022). Using the SciPy
linear regression feature we fit a power law to the data in logspace
andfoundaslopeof1.56withastandarderrorof0.06bestdescribed
thedata.ThatthisvalueisclosertotheKennicutttotalgasexponent
scaling with star formation than the molecular value, suggests that
the CNM is not gravitationally bound and actively forming stars.

CNM fraction ùëìùê∂>0. As expected the pressure steadily falls from
the inner galaxy to the outer, albeit with local variations. However,
strikingly the CNM vanishes from the gas phase at radii of about
12kpc, which corresponds to where the local pressure falls below
1000Kcm‚àí3.
4.2 Dependence on Radiation Field
The original Isolated galaxy modelled in Tress et al. (2020) had a
constant UV field and so it is possible to use this as a comparison
to investigate the importance of the interstellar radiation field in
setting the CNM distribution of the galaxy. Figure 14 shows theradialdependenceoftheCNMsurfacedensity,fraction,andvertical
dispersion for the constant field of magnitude ùê∫0. Most strikingly

and8kpcrespectively).Clearly,theCNMisfarmoresensitivetothe
local radiation field in this regard compared to the other phases.
With a constant interstellar radiation field the CNM fraction ùëìùê∂,
showninthemiddlepanelofFigure14,decreasesradiallyratherthan
remaining flat in the disc as was the case in Figure 6. The vertical
dispersion of the CNM, however, remains similar with and without
the varying field with the CNM having a dispersion of around 100
pc throughout the disc in both cases with no flaring.
To explore the origin of this behaviour we plot the mean total
midplane pressure as a function of radius for the model with a con-
stant field in Figure 15. The pressure now falls below a value of
103Kcm‚àí3atagalactocentricradiusof10kpcasopposedto12kpc
in the varying case. Both of these radii exactly correspond to where
the CNM disappears from the gas phase, once again confirming the
importantroleofmidplanepressureinsettingtheCNMdistribution.
4.3 Turbulence in the Outer Galaxy
However, pressure alone is not a full explanation for the distribu-
tion of the CNM in the gas phase. Turbulent velocity fluctuations
are important for pushing gas out of equilibrium and creating lo-
cal over-densities where the CNM can form. The vertical velocity
dispersion observed in H iin spiral galaxies is observed to be both

higher CNM fractions correspond to greater star formation rate surface density.

e.g. (Dickey & Lockman 1990; Kamphuis & Sancisi 1993; Rownd
et al. 1994; Meurer et al. 1996; de Blok & Walter 2006). Such ve-
locity dispersions can be theoretically explained via a number of
mechanismsthatincludesupernovafeedback(Dibetal.2006),MRI
instability (Piontek & Ostriker 2005, 2007), or accretion from the
galactic halo (Klessen & Hennebelle 2010). However, none of these
effectsareoperatinginourmodel.Intheoutergalaxythereisnostar
formation and hence no supernova feedback. Our model is purely
hydrodynamic, and it is isolated with no accretion of material from
the intergalactic medium.

persion is higher in the star-forming disc where we have supernova

galactic dynamics alone are enough to match the observed velocity
dispersion. Consequently, we are confident that we are not underes-
timatingtheCNMfractioninourmodelsduetoalackofturbulence.

4.4 CNM and Spiral Arms
Inourmodel,theCNMextendstomidwayintheouterdiscbutdoes
not cover its full extent. However, the absorption studies of Dickey
et al. (2022) find CNM in the entirety of the outer disc of the Milky
Way,outtoradiiof 40kpc.Kinematicdistancesarehardtoestimate
and absorption measurements give information along single sight
lines. Still, it seems clear that in the Milky Way the CNM can exist
beyond the radii predicted in our models.
One possibility is that spiral arm structure is able to concentrate
gas in isolated pockets in the outer disc. For example, Strasser et al.
(2007) observe CNM in the outer Milky Way, but specifically target
spiral arms. Our fiducial model is of an isolated galaxy without
strong spiral structure in the outer regions. Therefore to test the
importance of spiral arms in forming the CNM we turn to the other
model described by Tress et al. (2020), where a close encounter has
triggeredtheformationofwell-definedspiralarmstocreatean‚ÄòM51
analogue‚Äô. Figure 17 shows the gas distribution of the Interacting
model at the same time as the isolated model analysis. Note that
the interstellar radiation field is constant in this model so we also
compareittothemodeldiscussedinSection4.2ratherthanjustour
fiducial case. Figure A1 in Appendix A shows the column densitymaps for the Isolated model with a constant interstellar radiation
field.
The atomic hydrogen distribution in the outer galaxy is now very
different from the Isolated constant field case. Where before the
distribution smoothly filled the surface of the outer disc, now the
atomic hydrogen is concentrated in the extended spiral arms. The
lower panels of Figure 17 show that both H 2and the CNM now can
befoundintheoutergalaxy.Forinstance,aparticularlylargeclump
of CNM can be seen in the lower left corner. Once again the CNM
closely follows the molecular hydrogen, but with a higher column
density over a slightly larger area than the Isolated case.
Figure18showsthebinnedCNMfractionoftheinteractinggalaxy.
In the spiral arms, the CNM now persists to large radii albeit at a
low level. Figure 19 shows the radially averaged profiles for these
maps.Whenaveragedoveranannulusofthegalaxydiscthesurface

continues to rise for H i. This further suggests that the CNM in the
extremeoutergalaxyisconfinedtodistinctclumpsofgaswherethe
local pressure has been enhanced by spiral arms.
Certainly, the scenario presented here is only one possibility for
how CNM might exist in the extreme reaches of the outer galaxy.
Thispaperfocusesonapairofmodels,andisnotaparameterstudy.
It explores two extremes, one model with weak spiral structure, and
another with strong, and consequently brackets a range of possible
CNM distributions. Magnetic fields could add additional support to
molecular cloud envelopes which could then contain a substantial
amount of CNM as well as CO-dark molecular gas (e.g Smith et al.
2014). Another possibility is that cold gas could be accreted onto
the outer galaxy from the circumgalactic medium such as in the
MagellanicStreamofourownGalaxy(Foxetal.2014).Alternatively,
the discrepancies that we see between Milky Way observations and
our model may be due to projection effects. Our analysis has been

5 CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the distribution of the CNM in new high-
resolution simulations of an isolated disc galaxy based on those
presentedbyTressetal.(2020)butwitharadiallyvaryinginterstel-
lar radiation field. Our Areposimulations use a variety of custom
modules allowing us to follow the chemical and star-forming evolu-
tionofthedensegas.Theseincludedtime-dependentgaschemistry,
gas self-shielding from the ambient UV field, sink particles to rep-
resentstarformation,andsupernovafeedback.Theresultingmodels
allow the distribution of the CNM to be followed down to sub-pc
scales in the dense gas. Most of our analysis focuses on an isolated
galaxymodel,however,welatercompareittoamodelwithaconstant

14 kpc respectively.
(iv) The CNM fraction remains approximately constant with
galactocentricradiiinagreementwithmeasurementswithH iabsorp-
tion. This effect is a consequence of the falling interstellar radiation
field compensating for the decreasing column density at large radii.
In our comparison model with a constant interstellar field the CNM
fraction decreased with galactocentric radius.
(v) The vertical distribution of the CNM is clumpy in the star-
forming disc with a scale height of around ‚àº100pc and no flaring.
An analysis of the dispersion, ùúé(ùëß), suggests that the CNM is more
localised in the ùëß-direction than the overall H idistribution.
(vi) The star formation rate in the galaxy is well correlated with
the total midplane pressure in logspace as suggested by Kim et al.
(2013). We find that the CNM column density also correlates well
with pressure as expected from models of the ISM such as Wolfire
et al. (2003). We find no CNM in our isolated galaxy discs beyond
thepointwherethetotalpressure ùëÉùëá/ùëòùêµdropsbelow 1000Kcm‚àí3.
(vii) The ‚ÄòCNM Kennicutt-Schmidt‚Äô relation (i.e. the star forma-
tion rate surface density plotted against the CNM column density)
has a scaling of‚àº1.5, which is more similar to the relation seen for
total column density than the linear relation seen for molecular gas.
This suggests that while the formation of the CNM is a precursor
to star formation, it is not the predictor of gravitationally collapsing
star-formingregionsthattheH 2is.However,theCNMfractiondoes
increasewithstarformationdensity,withthehighestCNMfractions
always associated with active star formation.

APPENDIX A: CNM MAPS WITH A CONSTANT
RADIATION FIELD
In Figure A1 we show the projected column density maps for H i,
H2, and the CNM in the Isolated models with a constant interstellar
radiation field. The CNM no longer extends to the outer galaxy but
is tightly confined to around the H 2in the star-forming disc.
This paper has been typeset from a T EX/LATEX file prepared by the author.
