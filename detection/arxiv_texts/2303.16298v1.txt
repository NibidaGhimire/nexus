Abstract
In this article, the structure of the incremental quasistat ic contact problem with Coulomb
friction in linear elasticity (Signorini-Coulomb problem ) is unraveled and optimal existence
results are proved for the most general bidimensional probl em with arbitrary geometry and
elasticity modulus tensor. The problem is reduced to a varia tional inequality involving a
nonlinear operator which handles both elasticity and frict ion. This operator is proved to fall
into the class of the so-called Leray-Lions operators, so th at a result of Brézis can be invoked
to solve the variational inequality. It turns out that one pr operty in the deﬁnition of Leray-
Lions operators is diﬃcult to check and requires proving a ne w ﬁne property of the linear
elastic Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. This ﬁne property is only established in the case of
the bidimensional problem, limiting currently our existen ce result to that case. In the case
of isotropic elasticity, either homogeneous or heterogene ous, the existence of solutions to the
Signorini-Coulomb problem is proved for arbitrarily large friction coeﬃcient. In the case of
anisotropic elasticity, an example of nonexistence of a sol ution for large friction coeﬃcient is
exhibited and the existence of solutions is proved under an o ptimal condition for the friction
coeﬃcient.
1 Introduction
Among the basic Physics laws that every ﬁrst-year universit y student in Science learns, there
are the Hooke law (constitutive equation of a linear spring) and the Coulomb law of dry friction.
The study of the coupling between these two basic laws, that i s, the coupling between linear
elasticity and dry friction in the case of a continuum, amoun ts to studying linear elasticity
with unilateral contact at the boundary, complemented with the Coulomb law of dry friction.
This coupling should be naturally considered within the ela stodynamics framework, as it is
common experience that the coupling between elasticity and dry friction can excite vibratory
responses, such as brake squeal. This is actually completel y out of reach of current knowledge,
as no existence of solution has been proved yet for elastodyn amics with frictionless unilateral
contact condition on the boundary (the so-called dynamic Si gnorini problem). As there are
many examples of situations in which no vibrations are obser ved, it makes sense to perform the
analysis of the coupling between linear elasticity and dry f riction in the quasistatic framework,
that is, the case where the acceleration terms can be neglect ed. As the Coulomb law of dry
1friction involves velocities, the quasistatic problem is a n evolution problem, called the Signorini-
Coulomb problem. It falls back within the class of so-called rate-independent processes [14] such
as perfect elastoplasticity [5] or brittle fracture [9]. It turns out that the Signorini-Coulomb
problem raises huge mathematical diﬃculties which have not been fully overcome yet and that
this problem is less understood nowadays than perfect elast oplasticity and brittle fracture are.
In this paper, we consider the incremental problem, that is, the problem arising on each time
step of a time discretization. The mathematical structure o f that problem is unraveled for the
most general bidimensional case, yielding optimal existence results. We hope that our a nalysis
extends to higher space dimension, but this extension is sti ll to be performed (see Remark 2.20).
The same is true of the analysis of the limit towards 0 of the ti me step of the time discretization,
to obtain a solution of the time continuous quasistatic evol ution.
The precise formulation of the problem, the state of the art a nd the description of our
approach are given respectively in the next three sections.
1.1 Formulation of the Signorini-Coulomb problem
The Coulomb law of dry friction is an empirical law, proposed by Coulomb during the eighteenth
century on the basis of the analysis of the rigid motion of a pl ate under the action of a prescribed
overall force t. It relates the slipping velocity ˙ ut∈R2to the tangential force tt∈R2and the
normal force tn≤0. It reads as:
˙ut=0 =⇒ | tt| ≤ −ftn,
˙ut/\e}atio\slash=0 =⇒ tt=ftn˙ut
|˙ut|,
where | · |stands for the Euclidean norm and f≥0 is a given dimensionless, material-dependent
friction coeﬃcient. The Coulomb law of dry friction is equiv alent to the following more concise
formulation:
∀ˆv, tt·/parenleftbigˆv−˙ut/parenrightbig−ftn/parenleftbig|ˆv| − |˙ut|/parenrightbig≥0,
where ‘ ·’ stands for the usual Euclidean scalar product. In the parti cular casef= 0 (no friction),
the Coulomb law reduces to tt=0.
We are now ready to state the formal Signorini-Coulomb probl em, which couples elasticity
and dry friction. Consider a smooth bounded open subset Ω of RN(N= 2 orN= 3), whose
boundary is the union of three disjoint parts ∂Ω =ΓU∪ΓT∪ΓC. We will prescribe respectively
Dirichlet conditions on Γ U, Neumann conditions on Γ Tand contact conditions on Γ C. The
domain Ω is the reference conﬁguration of a linearly elastic body. The displacement is denoted
byu: Ω→RN, the (linearized) strain by ε(u) := ( ∇u+t∇u)/2, the stress by σ(u) =Λε(u),
where the elastic modulus tensor Λis assumed to satisfy the usual symmetry condition:
∀ˆε1,ˆε2∈MN×N
sym,∀x∈Ω, ˆε1:Λ(x)ˆε2=ˆε2:Λ(x)ˆε1, (1.1)
and the strong ellipticity condition:
∃α>0,∀ˆε∈MN×N
sym,∀x∈Ω, ˆε:Λ(x)ˆε≥αˆε:ˆε. (1.2)
Above, ‘:’ stands for the Frobenius scalar product between r eal matrices A:B:=/summationtext
i,jAijBij.
The outward unit normal to Ω will be denoted by nand any vector v:∂Ω→RNwill be split
into normal and tangential parts: v=vnn+vtwhere the scalar product n·vt= 0 vanishes.
2The loading consists in a given volume force F: Ω→RNand a given surface force T: ΓT→RN
on Γ T. The initial gap in the direction nbetween the elastic body Ω and a given rigid obstacle
is represented by a function g: ΓC→R, while the given friction coeﬃcient between the two
objects is denoted by f: ΓC→[0,+∞[. The quasistatic Signorini-Coulomb problem consists
in ﬁnding a displacement u(s) : Ω →RNdeﬁned for time s∈[0,T], satisfying a given initial
condition and, deﬁning the surface traction t:=σ(u)n=tnn+tt:


divσ(u) +F=0, in Ω,
u=0, on Γ U,
σ(u)n=T, on Γ T,

∀ˆv, tt·/parenleftbigˆv−˙ut/parenrightbig−ftn/parenleftbig|ˆv| − |˙ut|/parenrightbig≥0, on Γ C,(1.3)
where the dot stands for the time derivative and | · |for the Euclidean norm.
As it is usual in the analysis of such rate-independent quasi static evolutions, we introduce
a time discretization with time step ∆ s > 0, saysi:=i∆s(i= 0,1,...), and consider the
problem raised on one time step by replacing the velocity ˙ uby (ui−ui−1)/∆s. Denoting by
w:=ui−1the displacement at the end of the preceding time step, which is supposed to be given,
and dropping the index i, the problem on one time step is now to ﬁnd a (time independent )
displacement u: Ω→RNsatisfying:


divσ(u) +F=0, in Ω,

∀ˆv, tt·/parenleftbigˆv−ut/parenrightbig−ftn/parenleftbig|ˆv−wt| − |ut−wt|/parenrightbig≥0, on Γ C.(1.4)
1.2 Historical background
The mathematical analysis of the static problem (1.4) was ﬁr st considered by Duvaut & Lions
in [6]. They observed that when −ftnis replaced by a given τ≥0 in the last line of problem (1.4)
(Coulomb law), then one gets the following variational prob lem:
u= arg min
v,
v=0,on Γ U,
vn≤g,on Γ C,1

ΓTT·vdx+/integraldisplay
ΓCτ/vextendsingle/vextendsinglevt−wt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle,
which can be uniquely solved by the direct method of the Calcu lus of Variations, under appro-
priate regularity assumptions on the data. This remark sugg ests a ﬁxed point strategy applied
to the mapping τ/ma√sto→ −ftn. If the mapping τ/ma√sto→tnwere Lipschitz-continuous, then the mapping
τ/ma√sto→ −ftnwould be a contraction for small (Lipschitz) friction coeﬃc ientf, yielding a unique
ﬁxed point and therefore a unique solution of problem (1.4) i n that case. This hope was dashed
as no Lipschitz-continuity turns out to be fulﬁlled.
The next progress came from Jarušek’s PhD thesis [10, 11] who developed an original idea of
Nečas under his supervision. He was able to run successfully the ﬁxed-point strategy by applying
Tikhonov’s theorem in a Hilbert space endowed with the weak t opology. The compactness needed
to apply this theorem was obtained by requiring additional r egularity on the data and proving
3additional regularity on the solution by use of local rectiﬁ cation together with the shift technique,
involving very technical arguments. In this way, the ﬁrst ex istence result for problem (1.4) was
proved, provided that the data have little more regularity t han usually required, and more
importantly, that the friction coeﬃcient is small enough.
An alternative strategy of proof was later designed by Eck an d Jarušek in [7, 8]. They
consider a penalty regularization of problem (1.4), allowi ng for a small penetration of the body
into the obstacle. In practice, it amounts to replacing the p enultimate line in problem (1.4) by:
tn=−1
ε/angbracketleftbigun−g/angbracketrightbig+,
where /a\}b∇acketle{tx/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht+:= max {0,x}stands for the positive part and ε > 0 is the small regularization
parameter. They show that this regularized problem (1.4) ca n be easily solved by combining
the direct method of the Calculus of Variations with Schaude r’s ﬁxed point theorem, whatever
isε >0 and for possibly arbitrarily large friction coeﬃcient. Th en, a limit ε→0+ has to be
taken, which involves the product of two weakly convergent s equences. Some compactness is
sought and the local rectiﬁcation together with the shift te chnique is therefore used again. With
this approach also, the existence of a solution for problem ( 1.4) is proved, provided that the
data have little more regularity than usually required, and more importantly, that the friction
coeﬃcient is small enough. Here, ‘small enough’ means small er than a constant which depends
only on the elastic modulus tensor. Explicit optimal (with r espect to their strategy of proof)
values for that constant in terms of the Poisson ratio in the c ase of elastic isotropy are provided
in [7] for the cases N= 2 andN= 3. This result is still the best known up to now about the
existence of solution for problem (1.4). We underline that i t requires that the friction coeﬃcient
is smaller than a ﬁnite value, in both cases of isotropic and a nisotropic elasticity.
This result was later exploited by Andersson in [1] who prove d the existence of solution for
the Signorini-Coulomb evolution problem (1.3) with contin uous time. His proof relies on the
estimates of Eck and Jarušek obtained by use of the local rect iﬁcation together with the shift
technique, and therefore suﬀers the same limitations: the d ata have slightly more regularity
than usually required, and more importantly, the friction c oeﬃcient is small enough. Here we
emphasize that the only results up to now that escape a smalln ess condition for the friction
coeﬃcient are:
• the penalty regularization of problem (1.4) considered by Eck & Jarušek which can be
solved for arbitrarily large friction coeﬃcient, thanks to the direct method of the Calcu-
lus of Variations combined with Schauder’s ﬁxed point theor em (the same is true of its
continuous time counterpart in [1]),
• the ﬁnite-dimensional counterpart of problem (1.4) (Gale rkin approximation) which can be
solved for arbitrarily large friction coeﬃcient, thanks to the direct method of the Calculus
of Variations combined with Brouwer’s ﬁxed point theorem.
In this paper, we prove the new result that the bidimensional static problem (1.4) can be
solved for arbitrarily large friction coeﬃcient in the case of isotropic elasticity. We also prove that
a critical friction coeﬃcient, only depending on the elasti c modulus tensor, appears in the case
of anisotropic elasticity. For friction coeﬃcients smalle r than this critical value, the existence
of solutions is proved; we also exhibit an example of nonexis tence of solutions to the stationary
problem, for friction coeﬃcients larger than the critical v alue. Hence, our new strategy of proof
yields optimal existence results for the bidimensional sta tic problem (1.4).
41.3 Strategy of proof and organization of the article
We consider the static problem (1.4). We choose to take as the principal unknown, the normal
component tnof the restriction of the surface force tto the contact part Γ Cof the boundary.
Note that if tn=τ≤0 is known, then we can uniquely solve the following minimum p roblem:
u= arg min
v,
v=0,on Γ U1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v):Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΩF·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓTT·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓCτvn−/integraldisplay
ΓCfτ/vextendsingle/vextendsinglevt−wt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle,
and ﬁnd a displacement ﬁeld uin Ω satisfying (1.4), except for the fourth line (contact co ndi-
tions).
Considering the normal component unof the trace of that minimizer uon Γ C, we have a
nonlinear operator A:τ/ma√sto→un, which is well-deﬁned for all nonpositive τ≤0. Then the static
problem (1.4) can be equivalently formulated as a formal var iational inequality involving the
nonlinear operator A: ﬁndt≤0 on Γ Csuch that:
∀ˆt≤0,/integraldisplay
ΓC/parenleftbigAt−g)(ˆt−t)≥0. (1.5)
The nonlinear operator Adescribes both elasticity and dry friction. However, it tur ns out that
this operator is monotone only in the case of no friction f= 0. We are therefore led to seek more
general conditions on the nonlinear operator Athat ensures the solvability of the variational
inequality (1.5).
This was precisely the aim of the article [4] of Brézis, who so ught weak conditions on an
abstract nonlinear operator Aensuring that a sequence of Galerkin approximations for the
solution to (1.5) can be built, based on Brouwer’s theorem, a nd that a limit to a solution
of (1.5) can be taken. Brézis was able to identify a new class o f operators that he called
pseudomonotone , for which the variational inequality (1.5) can be solved. T he precise deﬁnition
of pseudomonotone operators is recalled in Appendix A. The c lass of pseudomonotone operators
contains a smaller class previously introduced by Leray and Lions [12] to solve a family of
nonlinear elliptic boundary problems. In a nutshell, the Le ray-Lions operators Aare basically
nonlinear operators which have the form:
At=A(t,t), (1.6)
where the operator Ahas a monotonicity property with respect to the second varia ble when
the ﬁrst variable is frozen, satisﬁes suitably weak continu ity properties separately in the two
variables, and a condition concerning the passage to the lim it in the product of two weakly
convergent sequences. The precise deﬁnition of Leray-Lion s operators is recalled in Appendix A
and involves four properties (i),(ii),(iii) and(iv). Brézis results [4] made it possible to solve
variational inequalities based on Leray-Lions operators.
Coming back to the formal variational inequality associate d with the static problem (1.4),
we see that the operator Ahas naturally the general form (1.6): it suﬃces to consider t he energy
functional:
Et,τ(v) :=1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v):Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΩF·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓTT·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓCτvn−/integraldisplay
ΓCft/vextendsingle/vextendsinglevt−wt/vextendsingle/vextendsingle,
and to deﬁne A(t,τ) as the normal component of the trace on Γ Cof the unique minimizer of
Et,τon the space of those vsuch that v|ΓU=0. Hence,At:=A(t,t) and by the results of
5Brézis surveyed in Appendix A, we are brought back to prove th at the operator Ais Leray-
Lions and coercive to prove the existence of a solution for th e static problem (1.4). It turns
out that it is very easy to prove that Ais unconditionally coercive in any dimension and that
properties (i),(ii),(iii)in the deﬁnition of Leray-Lions operator (Deﬁnition A.5 in A ppendix A)
are unconditionally fulﬁlled in any dimension.
The challenging part is to prove that property (iv)in the deﬁnition of Leray-Lions operator is
also fulﬁlled. This requires to pass to the limit in a product of two weakly converging sequences,
and therefore to prove somehow a compactness result. We prov e such a compactness result,
ﬁrst in the restrictive case of bidimensional isotropic ela sticity, based on a new ﬁne property
of the elastic Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. As a consequ ence we obtain the solvability of
the bidimensional static problem (1.4) in the case of isotro pic elasticity without any smallness
condition on the friction coeﬃcient.
The handling of anisotropy raises new challenges as it turns out that the operator A, as
deﬁned in the isotropic case, needs no longer to be Leray-Lio ns in the case of anisotropic elasticity.
The deﬁnition of the operator Ahas to be slightly adapted, so that it can be proved to be Leray -
Lions even in the anisotropic case. But this adaptation requ ires a critical condition on the
friction coeﬃcient (not needed in the isotropic case). We ve rify that this condition is optimal
by proving a non-existence result for larger friction coeﬃc ients.
The ﬁrst use of pseudomonotone operators in the sense of Bréz is in the context of frictional
contact problems seems to be [2]. There, the stationary moti on of a 2d elastic half-space is
analyzed, under frictional contact with a given obstacle.
The article will be split into two parts: the case of isotropi c elasticity will be extensively dis-
cussed in Section 2 and the generalization to anisotropic el asticity will be discussed in Section 3.
Section 2 will consist in three subsections. In Subsection 2 .1, we state the regularity assumptions
on the data and give easy preliminary lemmas. Subsection 2.2 gathers the existence proof for
the bidimensional isotropic elastic case. The proof of the r equired ﬁne property of the elastic
Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, which is a more technical m atter, is postponed to Subsection 2.3.
The discussion of anisotropic elasticity in Section 3 is spl it into three subsections. In Subsec-
tion 3.1, an example of frictional contact problem with no so lution for large friction coeﬃcient
is presented. Subsection 3.2 contains the discussion about the generalization of the solvability
result previously obtained in isotropic elasticity to the c ase of anisotropy. The detailed proof
of the structure of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for t he homogeneous anisotropic elastic
half-space, which plays a central role in the analysis, is po stponed to Subsection 3.3. Appendix A
recalls general results on pseudomonotone and Leray-Lions operators.
2 The case of isotropic elasticity
The framework of this section is that of isotropic elasticit y. We rigorously formulate the static
contact problem with Coulomb friction condition and prove t he existence of at least one solution
in the bidimensional case.
2.1 Data regularity and trace spaces
In all the sequel, the bounded open set Ω ⊂RNwill be supposed connected and of class C1,1,
which entails in particular that n∈W1,∞(∂Ω;RN). We consider three nonintersecting open
subsets Γ U, ΓTand Γ Cof the boundary ∂Ω of Ω, such that ∂Ω = ΓU∪ΓT∪ΓC(where Γ
6stands for the closure of Γ in ∂Ω). For the sake of simplicity, we make the following additio nal
hypotheses.
• The subset Γ Uhas positive Lebesgue measure. As a homogeneous Dirichlet c ondition will
be prescribed on Γ U, this hypothesis is a convenience to obtain some coercivity . This
hypothesis is not essential and could be dropped at the price of additional complexity of
the presentation.
• The subset Γ C⊂∂Ω is of class C0,1(that is, Lipschitz) and dist(Γ U,ΓC)>0. Again, this
hypothesis is made for convenience and is probably not essen tial. It ensures that the space
of traces on Γ Cof functions in H1(Ω) that vanish on Γ U:
H:=/braceleftig
u|ΓC/vextendsingle/vextendsingleu∈H1(Ω) andu= 0 on Γ U/bracerightig
is exactlyH1/2(ΓC). Indeed, the space of traces of functions in H1(Ω) isH1/2(∂Ω)
and restrictions to Γ Cof functions in H1/2(∂Ω) are inH1/2(ΓC). Vice versa, when
dist(Γ U,ΓC)>0, it is always possible to ﬁnd an extension to ∂Ω of a given function in
H1/2(ΓC), so that this extension vanishes identically in Γ U. When this hypothesis is not
made, the above trace space can be strictly smaller than H1/2(ΓC) (see [13, Section 11]).
We deﬁne the space H−1/2(ΓC) as the dual space of H1/2(ΓC). Given Λ∈L∞(Ω) satisfying
requirements (1.1) and (1.2), we have the following standar d result on the continuity of the
Dirichlet operator, based on Korn’s inequality. Here and he nceforth /a\}b∇acketle{t·,·/a\}b∇acket∇i}htwill denote the duality
product.
Proposition 2.1 LetJΛ:H1/2(ΓC;RN)→ {v∈H1(Ω,RN) :v|ΓU=0}be deﬁned as
JΛ(u) := arg min
v∈H1(Ω;RN),

Then, /ba∇dblJΛ(u)/ba∇dblH1(Ω,RN)is a norm on H1/2(ΓC;RN)which is equivalent to that of H1/2(ΓC;RN).
In an analogous way, let J′

We recall the following standard results.

are well-deﬁned and continuous.
7Recalling that Ω has been assumed connected and of class C1,1, we can combine Proposi-
tion 2.1 with Proposition 2.2 to yield:
Proposition 2.3 Letu∈H1/2(ΓC;RN). Then,un:=u·n∈H1/2(ΓC)and the mappings:

are continuous. On the dual side, given t∈H−1/2(ΓC;RN), we deﬁne tn∈H−1/2(ΓC)by the
formula:
∀v∈H1/2(ΓC), /a\}b∇acketle{ttn,v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht:=/a\}b∇acketle{tt,vn/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht,
and the mapping t/ma√sto→tnis continuous from H−1/2(ΓC;RN)intoH−1/2(ΓC). In particular, there
existsC > 0such that:

2.2 Existence in the case of isotropic elasticity
Our strategy for proving the existence of a solution to the Si gnorini-Coulomb problem on one
time step is to express this problem in terms of a variational inequality applying to tn∈
H−1/2(ΓC), the unknown normal part of the surface traction on Γ C. This variational inequality
is based on a nonlinear operator Awhose role is to handle both elasticity in the body and dry
friction on the boundary.
More precisely, we will assume the gap with the obstacle to be g∈H1/2(ΓC), and we will
set:
K:=/braceleftig
ˆt∈H−1/2(ΓC)/vextendsingle/vextendsingleˆt≤0/bracerightig
. (2.1)
We will put the Signorini-Coulomb problem on one time step un der the form of ﬁnding tn∈K
such that:
∀ˆt∈K,/angbracketleftbigAtn−g,ˆt−tn/angbracketrightbig≥0,
for an appropriate nonlinear operator A:K→H1/2(ΓC). Then, it will be suﬃcient to prove that
Ais pseudomonotone in the sense of Brézis and coercive (see Ap pendix A) to yield the existence
of a solution for this variational inequality. Actually, th e operator will be proved to belong to
a subclass of pseudomonotone operators, the so-called subc lass of Leray-Lions operators (see
Appendix A).

We now handle the task of proving that the operator Aof Deﬁnition 2.4 is a Leray-Lions
operator, that is, that the corresponding operator Asatisﬁes properties (i),(ii),(iii) and(iv)
of Deﬁnition A.5 in Appendix A. We will see that properties (i),(ii)and(iii)are easily checked
and that all the diﬃculty concentrates on the proof of proper ty(iv).
Proposition 2.6 LetAbe as in Deﬁnition 2.4 and let t∈Kbe arbitrary. The mapping
τ/ma√sto→A(t,τ)is Lipschitz-continuous from K⊂H−1/2toH1/2. It also satisﬁes the strong
monotonicity property:
∀τ∈K,/angbracketleftbigA(t,t)−A(t,τ), t−τ/angbracketrightbig≥C/vextenddouble/vextenddoublet−τ/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2

for some positive constant C > 0independent of tandτ. In particular, property (i) of Deﬁni-
tion A.5 is fulﬁlled.
9Proof. Lett,τ1,τ2∈K. We denote by uithe minimizer of Et,τionVintroduced in Deﬁnition
2.4. Taking u2as a test function in the variational inequality (2.3) chara cterizing u1,u1as
a test function in the variational inequality characterizi ngu2and taking the sum of the two
corresponding inequalities, we get:

Since u1−u2=JΛ(u1

which is exactly the Lipschitz-continuity of the mapping τ/ma√sto→A(t,τ).

∀v∈V,/angbracketleftbigτ,v|ΓC/angbracketrightbig:=/integraldisplay
Ωε(u1−u2) :Λε(v) dx.
Integrating by parts, the right-hand side of the previous ex pression is seen to depend only on
v|ΓC, so that τis well-deﬁned. In addition, J′
Λ(τ) = u1−u2andτn=τ1−τ2, withJ′

andτnintroduced in Propositions 2.1 and 2.3 respectively. Combi ning Proposition 2.3 with
inequality (2.4), we obtain:

,
for some positive constant C > 0, independent of t,τ1,τ2∈K.
Since the mapping τ/ma√sto→A(t,τ) is bounded by Proposition 2.5 and since Lipschitz-continu ity
obviously implies hemicontinuity, property (i)of Deﬁnition A.5 is proved. /square
Proposition 2.7 LetAbe as in Deﬁnition 2.4 and let τ∈Kbe arbitrary. The mapping
t/ma√sto→A(t,τ)is bounded and continuous from K⊂H−1/2toH1/2. In particular, property (ii) of
Deﬁnition A.5 is fulﬁlled.
Proof. The boundedness has already been proved in Proposition 2.5. To prove the continuity,
we ﬁrst pick an arbitrary R> 0 andt1,t2∈K, such that /ba∇dblti/ba∇dblH−1/2≤R, fori= 1,2. Denoting
byuithe minimizer of Eti,τonVintroduced in Deﬁnition 2.4, Proposition 2.5 shows that /ba∇dblui/ba∇dblH1
(i= 1,2) are bounded by a constant depending on F,T,τandR, but independent of t1andt2.
The variational inequalities characterizing u1andu2(see (2.3)) yield:

K⊂H−1/2toH1/2. /square
10Proposition 2.8 LetAbe as in Deﬁnition 2.4. Let tk⇀ t be a weakly converging sequence
inKsuch that limk→+∞/a\}b∇acketle{tA(tk,tk)−A(tk,t),tk−t/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht= 0. Then, for all τ∈K, the sequence
A(tk,τ)converges strongly in H1/2towards A(t,τ). In particular, property (iii) of Deﬁni-
tion A.5 is fulﬁlled.
Proof. The strong monotonicity property of Proposition 2.6 entail s that the sequence tkcon-
verges strongly in H−1/2towardst. The continuity property of Proposition 2.7 yields the stro ng
convergence of A(tk,τ) towards A(t,τ). /square
At this point, there remains only to prove that Aalso fulﬁls property (iv)of Deﬁnition A.5
to reach the conclusion that the operator A:K→H1/2is Leray-Lions and therefore pseu-
domonotone. If it is coercive in the sense of Deﬁnition A.2, i n addition, then the solvability of
the Signorini-Coulomb problem will follow from Theorem A.3 . As it turns out that the coercivity
is easy to obtain and that property (iv)is very diﬃcult, we ﬁrst get rid of the coercivity result.
Proposition 2.9 The operator Ain Deﬁnition 2.4 is coercive in the sense:

Let now deal with property (iv)of Deﬁnition A.5. It involves the handling of a product of
two weakly converging sequences which turns out to raise hug e diﬃculties. The next theorem
shows how to overcome such diﬃculties in the bidimensional c aseN= 2, under the assumptions
that the elastic modulus tensor Λis that of isotropic elasticity at each point and that it is
Lipschitz-continuous. Its proof is postponed to Section 2. 3.
SinceN= 2, the tangential direction is (pointwisely) unique, so th attt/ba∇dblvt. Hence, ttand
vtwill be replaced below by their scalar components ttandvt. We will denote by M(ΓC) the
set of signed Radon measures with support in ΓC.
Theorem 2.10 LetN= 2and let Λ∈W1,∞and isotropic. For ˜t∈H−1/2(ΓC)∩M(ΓC), we
denote by uthe unique minimizer on Vof:
v/ma√sto→1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v) :Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΓC˜tvt,
and byun∈H1/2(ΓC)the normal part of the trace of uonΓC. The linear mapping ˜t/ma√sto→un=
L˜tis continuous for the strong topologies of H−1/2(ΓC)andH1/2(ΓC)(and also for the weak
topologies, as it is linear).
Then, for any sequence tk∈Kconverging weakly in H−1/2(ΓC)towards a limit t∈K, and
any sequence ˜tk⇀˜tinH−1/2(ΓC)∩M(ΓC)such that |˜tk| ≤ −tk, we have:
lim
k→+∞/angbracketleftbigL˜tk,tk/angbracketrightbig=/angbracketleftbigL˜t,t/angbracketrightbig.
Remark 2.11 To prove Theorem 2.10, it would be natural to try to prove that the injection of K
intoH−1/2(ΓC)is compact, in the spirit of the result of Murat [15]. Actuall y, we can adapt the
counterexample given at the second page of [15] to prove that the injection of KintoH−1/2(ΓC)
isnotcompact. In particular, the nonnegative function ǫ|logǫ|−1/2/(x2+ǫ2)converges weakly
inH−1/2(−1,1)towards 0, asǫ→0+, but itsH−1/2(−1,1)norm converges towards a positive
value (see Proposition 3.2). Theorem 2.10 is actually a ﬁne p roperty of the elasticity operator,
as shown in Section 2.3.
Corollary 2.12 LetN= 2,Λ∈W1,∞and isotropic, and let Abe as in Deﬁnition 2.4. Let
τ∈K,tk⇀tbe a weakly convergent sequence in Ksuch that A(tk,τ)⇀F converges weakly
inH1/2(ΓC)towards some limit F. Then, limk→+∞/a\}b∇acketle{tA(tk,τ),tk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{tF,t/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht. In other words,
under the previous hypotheses, property (iv) of Deﬁnition A .5 holds true and the operator Ais
a Leray-Lions operator.
Proof. Letuk∈Vbe the minimizer on VofEtk,τ(see Deﬁnition 2.4). The idea is to split
uk, and then A(tk,τ) =uk
n, into two parts, the ﬁrst not depending on kand having τas
normal traction on Γ C; the second having the same tangent traction as ukon Γ C. The normal
component of this second part will be written in terms of the l inear operator Lintroduced in
Theorem 2.10.
LetU∈Vbe the minimizer on Vof:
v→1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v) :Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΩF·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓTT·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓCτvn.
12Let˜tkbe the element of H−1/2(ΓC;RN) deﬁned by:
∀v∈V,/angbracketleftbig˜tk,v|ΓC/angbracketrightbig:=/integraldisplay
Ωε(uk−U) :Λε(v) dx.
Then, the normal part vanishes: ˜tk
n=τ−τ= 0. We denote by ˜tkthe (scalar-valued) component
of˜tkalong the tangent vector (as N= 2). By (2.3) for uk, using uk+vas test function, we
get:
∀v∈H1/2(ΓC),/angbracketleftbig˜tk,v/angbracketrightbig−/angbracketleftbigftk,|v|/angbracketrightbig≥0,
which, asftkis a nonpositive measure, entails that ˜tkis a measure such that |˜tk| ≤ −ftk. As
the sequence tkis assumed to weakly converge in H−1/2(ΓC), it is bounded in the same space.
By the inequality |/a\}b∇acketle{t˜tk,v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht| ≤ −/a\}b∇acketle{tftk,|v|/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤ /ba∇dblf/ba∇dblW1,∞/ba∇dbltk/ba∇dblH−1/2/ba∇dblv/ba∇dblH1/2, the sequence ˜tkis also
bounded in H−1/2(ΓC). Also, by linearity, we have:
A(tk,τ) =Un+ (uk
n−Un) =Un+L˜tk,
whereLdenotes the linear operator deﬁned in the statement of Theor em 2.10. The sequence
/a\}b∇acketle{tA(tk,τ),tk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{tUn+L˜tk,tk/a\}b∇acket∇i}htis bounded. Extracting a subsequence if necessary, it conve rges.
Possibly extracting another subsequence, we may assume tha t˜tkconverges weakly in H−1/2(ΓC)
towards some limit ˜t. AsA(tk,τ)⇀ F andLis continuous for the weak topologies, we have
the identity F=Un+L˜t. Now, Theorem 2.10 yields:
lim
k→+∞/angbracketleftbigA(tk,τ),tk/angbracketrightbig=/a\}b∇acketle{tF,t/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.
As the limit is the same for all extracted subsequences, the c onvergence of the whole limit holds
true. /square
Bringing Propositions 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9 and Corollary 2.12 together, and invoking Proposi-
tion A.6 in Appendix A, we have proved:
Theorem 2.13 LetN= 2and let Λ∈W1,∞and isotropic. Then, the operator Ain Deﬁni-
tion 2.4 is a Leray-Lions operator and is therefore pseudomo notone. In addition, it is coercive.
We can now rely on Brézis’s theorem (Theorem A.3 in Appendix A ) to solve variational
inequalities based on the operator A.
Theorem 2.14 LetN= 2and let Λ∈W1,∞and isotropic, f∈W1,∞(ΓC),F∈L2(Ω,RN),
T∈L2(ΓT,RN),g∈H1/2(ΓC)andwt∈H1/2(ΓC;RN). Let also Abe as in Deﬁnition 2.4.
Then, there exists t∈Ksatisfying the variational inequality:
∀ˆt∈K,/angbracketleftbigAt−g,ˆt−t/angbracketrightbig≥0.
It is readily checked that the unique minimizer u∈VofEt,tonV(see Deﬁnition 2.4) with
tgiven by Theorem 2.14, solves the formal static Signorini-C oulomb problem (1.4). This means
that, whenever the minimizer is smooth enough, the conditio ns are fulﬁlled pointwisely. In
particular, the last condition of (1.4) gives on Γ C:
ut−wt= 0 ⇒ |tt| ≤ −ftn,
ut−wt/\e}atio\slash= 0 ⇒tt=−ftnut−wt
|ut−wt|.
132.3 Proof of Theorem 2.10
In this section, we give a detailed proof of Theorem 2.10 whic h is the cornerstone of our proof
of the existence of solutions for the Signorini-Coulomb pro blem.
In order to both assess the diﬃculty of the matter involved an d to display the core idea of our
strategy of proof, it is useful to examine ﬁrst the particula r case of the isotropic homogeneous
2d half-space. Indeed, in this case, the explicit knowledge of the fundamental solution makes it
possible to express the solution of the standard elastic Neu mann problem for the half-space in
terms of a convolution product. In other words, the operator Lof Theorem 2.10 reduces in this
case to a convolution operator with a function which is known explicitly.
Lemma 2.15 (Fundamental solution of the 2d isotropic half-s pace) Consider the half-
space {(x,y)∈R2|y < 0}ﬁlled with an isotropic homogeneous linearly elastic mater ial of
Young modulus E > 0and Poisson ratio ν∈]−1,1/2[. Then, all the tempered distributional
displacements u0satisfying the elastic equilibrium equations with zero bod y forces and surface
traction equal to Tδ, whereδis the Dirac measure at (0,0)andT= (Tx,Ty)is a given element
ofR2, are of the form:

andUx,Uy,Ω,Σdenote four arbitrary real constants.
Proof. This is a classical result, obtained by use of the Fourier tra nsform, and the veriﬁcation
is left to the reader (this is in fact a particular case of the p roof of Theorem 3.1 in Section 3.3).
/square
Remark 2.16 The constant Σis readily seen to be a component of the stress tensor at inﬁni ty.
The three remaining constants represent an arbitrary overa ll rigid displacement. This arbitrary
aﬃne displacement plays no role in the sequel where Ux=Uy= Ω = Σ = 0 will be systematically
chosen.
Given a compactly supported surface traction distribution ˜t∈H−1/2(−1,1;R2) with normal
and tangential parts ˜tnand˜tt, the normal part of the surface displacement reads as:
un=uy=−2(1−ν2)
πElog| · | ∗ ˜tn−(1−2ν)(1 +ν)
2Esgn(·)∗˜tt,
14up to an arbitrary overall rigid displacement component whi ch plays no role in the sequel and
is therefore omitted. Above, sgn( ·) stands for the sign function and ∗for the convolution
product. Hence, in the case of the half-space, the normal com ponent of the surface displacement
induced by a tangential traction distribution is obtained a s a convolution with the ‘sign’ function.
Therefore, the operator L:H−1/2(−1,1)→H1/2(−1,1) in the statement of Theorem 2.10, is
given by:
L˜t= sgn( ·)∗˜t,
where sgn( ·)∗˜tdenotes actually the restriction to ] −1,1[ of sgn( ·)∗˜tand the (nonzero) multiplica-
tive constant has been dropped. This operator is actually an isomorphism from H−1/2(−1,1)
ontoH1/2(−1,1). In the particular case of the isotropic homogeneous 2d ha lf-space, Theo-
rem 2.10 reduces to the following result for which we are goin g to provide a direct proof.
Theorem 2.17 Lettk≥0be a sequence in the nonnegative cone of H−1/2(−1,1)that converges
weakly inH−1/2(−1,1)towards a limit t. Let also ˜tkbe a sequence in H−1/2(−1,1)∩M([−1,1])
that converges weakly in H−1/2(−1,1)towards a limit ˜tand such that |˜tk| ≤tk, for allk. Then:
lim
k→+∞/angbracketleftbigsgn(·)∗˜tk,tk/angbracketrightbig=/angbracketleftbigsgn(·)∗˜t,t/angbracketrightbig.
Proof. Since /ba∇dbltk/ba∇dblM([−1,1])=/a\}b∇acketle{ttk,1/a\}b∇acket∇i}htand the weakly converging sequence tkis bounded in
H−1/2(−1,1), it is also bounded in M([−1,1]). It therefore converges weakly-* in M([−1,1])
towardst. As |˜tk| ≤tk, the sequence ˜tkis also bounded in M([−1,1]) and therefore converges
weakly-* in M([−1,1]) towards ˜t.
The convolution with the sign function is an antisymmetric o peration, that is
/angbracketleftbigsgn(·)∗˜tk,tk/angbracketrightbig=−/angbracketleftbig˜tk,sgn(·)∗tk/angbracketrightbig.
As a measure tkinH−1/2(−1,1)∩M([−1,1]) has no atoms, all the primitives uk:= sgn( ·)∗tk
andu:= sgn( ·)∗tare continuous functions. They are also nondecreasing, as tk≥0. We can
therefore apply the two following arguments which yield the strong convergence in C0([−1,1])
of the sequence uktowardsu.
1. The weak-* convergence in M([−1,1]) oftkentails the pointwise convergence of the se-
quence/integraltextx
−1tkand therefore of the sequence uk:= sgn( ·)∗tktowardsu, for allx∈[−1,1].
To see it, consider x∈]−1,1[ andǫ >0. As the measure thas no atoms, we can build
a continuous function ϕε: [−1,1]→[0,1], supported in [ −1,x] and a continuous function
ψε: [−1,1]→[0,1] that takes the value 1 all over [ −1,x], such that:
(1−ε)/integraldisplayx
−1t≤/integraldisplay1
−1ϕεt≤/integraldisplayx
−1t≤/integraldisplay1
−1ψεt≤(1 +ε)/integraldisplayx
−1t.
As:
∀k∈N,/integraldisplay1
−1ϕεtk≤/integraldisplayx
−1tk≤/integraldisplay1
−1ψεtk,
we obtain that the sequence of functions x/ma√sto→/integraltextx
−1tkconverges pointwisely towards x/ma√sto→/integraltextx
−1t.
2. Each function ukis monotone and pointwisely converging to a continuous func tion in the
compact set [ −1,1]. This in fact forces ukto converge uniformly. Indeed, the pointwise
15limitu, being continuous on the compact [ −1,1], is uniformly continuous. Given ǫ >0,
there exist ﬁnitely many −1 =x0<x 1· · ·<x n= 1 such that, for all iand allx∈[xi,xi+1],
one has |u(x)−u(xi)|<ǫ. Also, for suﬃciently large k, and alli, one has |u(xi)−uk(xi)|<ǫ.
Using the fact that all the ukare nondecreasing, we get |uk(x)−u(x)|<5ǫ, for suﬃciently
largekand allx∈[−1,1]. That is, the sequence ukconverges strongly in C0([−1,1])
towardsu.
This entails lim k→+∞/a\}b∇acketle{t˜tk,uk/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{t˜t,u/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht, and therefore the claim. /square
Remark 2.18 In Theorem 2.17, the function sgn (·)could be replaced by any monotone function.
As any function with bounded variation is the diﬀerence of tw o monotone functions, it is readily
checked that Theorem 2.17 holds true, with the function sgn (·)replaced by an arbitrary function
h∈BV([−r,r]), withr>2.
Remark 2.19 The operator ˜t/ma√sto→log| · | ∗ ˜tis also an isomorphism from H−1/2(−1,1)onto
H1/2(−1,1). But we cannot replace the function sgn (·)in the above theorem by the function log|·
|, otherwise the conclusion would break. To see it, recall tha t the mapping t/ma√sto→/radicalbig
−/a\}b∇acketle{tlog| · | ∗t,t/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
is a norm on H−1/2(−1,1)which is equivalent to the norm of H−1/2(see, for example, [3,
Theorem 3] or Theorem 3.2 in this paper). In the particular ca se where ˜tk=tk, the conclusion
of the theorem, with sgn (·)replaced by log| · |, would actually be the convergence of the norms,
which together with weak convergence, classically yields s trong convergence. In other terms, the
above theorem, with sgn (·)replaced by log| · |, would imply that the injection of the nonnegative
cone ofH−1/2(−1,1)intoH−1/2(−1,1)is compact. But the injection of the nonnegative cone
ofH−1/2(−1,1)intoH−1/2(−1,1)is not compact (a counterexample is given in Remark 2.11).
Therefore, one cannot replace the function sgn (·)in the above theorem by the function log|·|. In
other words, the fact that the operator Lmaps the tangential traction to the normal displacement
plays an essential role. In that sense, the above theorem is a ﬁne property of the elasticity
operator rather than a general topological property.
Remark 2.20 The proof of Theorem 2.17 can be rephrased by saying that the i nclusion
(H1/2∩BV)(−1,1)⊂C0(−1,1)
is compact in the following sense: for uk,u∈(H1/2∩BV)(−1,1), we have
uk⇀u weakly-H1/2and strictly- BV =⇒uk→ustrongly-L∞,
where ’strictly- BV’ means that uk→ustrongly-L1and|Duk|(−1,1)→ |Du|(−1,1). This
compactness property fails in higher dimension.
The only point of the article where we need N= 2is precisely Theorem 2.17. In dimension
N= 3, in the simplest case, one is led to pass to the limit in the fol lowing expression
lim
k→+∞/angbracketleftbigx
x2+y2∗˜tk,tk/angbracketrightbig
where ˜tkandtkare supported in ]−1,1[2and satisfy hypotheses analogous to those of Theorem
2.17. Due to the previous discussion, the 2D argument does no t generalize directly to this case
and further inquiries are needed.
16To extend Theorem 2.17 to more general geometries, that is, t o the case of bounded bodies,
we will rely on the classical idea that the fundamental solut ion of the bounded body is locally that
of the half-space with the addition of a smooth correction. T his idea is precisely implemented
in the following representation formula.
Lemma 2.21 LetN= 2andΛ∈W1,∞be isotropic at each x∈Ω. Let alsot∈H−1/2(ΓC)∩
M(ΓC). We denote by uthe unique minimizer on Vof:
v/ma√sto→1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v) :Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΓCtvt.
Then, the normal part unof the trace of uonΓCcan be put under the form:
for a.a.x∈ΓC, u n(x) =/integraldisplay
x′∈ΓCtg(x,x′)
for some function g: ΓC×ΓC→R, independent of t, of the form:
g(x,x′) =(1−2ν(x′))(1 +ν(x′))
2E(x′)h(x,x′) + ˜g(x,x′),
where the function htakes only the two values −1,+1and is continuous on ΓC×ΓC\∆, with
∆ := {(x,x)|x∈ΓC}being the diagonal, and where ˜g:x′→g(·,x′)∈C0(ΓC;H1/2(ΓC)).
Proof.
Step 1. Construction of a fundamental solution for the bounded body . Fixx′∈Γ, with Γ :=
∂Ω\ΓU, and ˜T= (˜Tx,˜Ty)∈R2. Then, there exist unique (˜u,˜u|Γ)∈L1(Ω)×L1(Γ)such that:
∀v∈W2,∞(Ω;R2)with v|ΓU=0,/integraldisplay
Ω˜u·divσ(v) dx=−˜T·v(x′) +/integraldisplay
Γ˜u|Γ·σ(v)ndx.(2.5)
The function ˜uhas the additional regularity ˜u∈H1(Ω\Vx′)where Vx′is an arbitrary neighbor-
hood ofx′, and ˜u|Γcoincides with the trace of ˜uonΓ. In the sequel, the notation g(x,x′) := ˜u(x)
will be used.
This is a classical matter and the proof is sketched only for t he sake of completeness. Consider
the mapping:
L/braceleftigg
L2(Ω;R2)×L2(Γ;R2)→L2(Ω;R2)×L2(Γ;R2)
(F,T)/ma√sto→(u,u|Γ)
where udenotes the unique minimizer on V={v∈H1(Ω;R2)|v|ΓU=0}of
v/ma√sto→1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v) :Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΩF·vdx−/integraldisplay
ΓT·vdx.
The linear mapping L=L∗is self-adjoint. By standard regularity results for ellipt ic boundary-
value problems, if ( F,T)∈Lp(Ω)×Lp(Γ) for some p > 2, then u∈W1,p(Ω)⊂C0(Ω) (as
the dimension of space is 2). Hence, L:Lp(Ω)×Lp(Γ)→C0(Ω)×C0(Γ). By duality,
L∗:M(Ω)×M(Γ)→Lp′(Ω)×Lp′(Γ) can be seen as an extension of L, asLis self-adjoint.
Then, it is readily checked that (˜ u,˜u|Γ) :=L∗(0,˜Tδx′) (whereδx′is the Dirac measure at x′)
satisﬁes (2.5). Uniqueness and the fact that ˜ u∈H1(Ω\Vx′) is a consequence of the standard
17local regularity results for elliptic problems which apply to very weak solutions such as the one
satisfying (2.5).
Step 2. Regularity with respect to xof the trace of g(x,x′)onΓ :=∂Ω\ΓU. Givenx′∈Γand
˜T= (˜Tx,˜Ty)∈R2\ {0}a unit tangent vector at x′(that is, ˜T·n(x′) = 0 and ˜T2
x+˜T2
y= 1),
there exists x/ma√sto→˜g(x,x′)∈H1/2(Γ), such that:
for a.a.x∈Γ, g n(x,x′) =(1−2ν(x′))(1 +ν(x′))
2E(x′)h(x,x′) + ˜g(x,x′),
where the function htakes only the two values −1,+1and is continuous on Γ×Γ\∆, with
∆ := {(x,x)|x∈Γ}being the diagonal.
Pickx′∈Γ. There exist an open neighborhood Vx′ofx′inR2withVx′∩ΓU=∅, an open
ballBcentered at 0and aW2,∞-diﬀeomorphism φ:Vx′→B, such that φ(x′) =0,R:=∇φ(x′)
is a rotation and such that φinduces a diﬀeomorphism of Vx′∩Ω ontoD:=B∩{y<0}. We take
T=R˜T(so thatTy= 0),E=E(x′),ν=ν(x′) andUx=Uy= Ω = Σ = 0 in the deﬁnition of
u0in Lemma 2.15. Careful examination of the expression of u0shows that u0is inW1,p(D;R2),
for allp∈[1,2[, and isC∞inD\ {0}. Therefore the displacement u0◦φis inW1,p(Vx′∩Ω).
Considering an appropriate cut-oﬀ function ϕinC∞
c(R2) which is identically equal to 1 on a
neighborhood of x′, the displacement ϕR−1(u0◦φ) has compact support in Vx′. We denote by
˜ u0the extension to Ω by zero. In the particular case where ˜T= (˜Tx,˜Ty)∈R2\ {0}is a unit
tangent vector at x′, the following property of ˜ u0is readily checked from the explicit expression
ofu0in Lemma 2.15.
Since ˜Tis tangent, the normal trace ˜ u0
non∂Ω is inW1,∞(∂Ω\ {x′}) (with support
inVx′). It therefore has limits as x→x′−andx→x′+, but these two limits are
diﬀerent (as u0
2(0−,0−)/\e}atio\slash=u0
2(0+,0−)). Actually, we have:
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle˜u0
n(x′−)−˜u0
n(x′+)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=(1−2ν(x′))(1 +ν(x′))
E(x′).
To get the claim of Step 2, it is now suﬃcient to prove that g(·,x′)−˜ u0(·)∈H1(Ω). By the
deﬁnition of g(·,x′), this is going to be a consequence of the following statemen t.
There exist τ(·,x′)∈Lp(Γ;R2), for allp∈[1,2[, and Φ(·,x′)∈Lp(Ω;R2), for all
p∈[1,2[, such that:
∀v∈W2,∞(Ω;R2) such that: v|ΓU=0,
/integraldisplay
Ωε(˜ u0) :Λε(v) dx=˜T·v(x′) +/integraldisplay
ΩΦ(x,x′)·v(x) dx+/integraldisplay
Γτ(x,x′)·v(x) dx.
(2.6)
The key fact will be the observation that the displacement u0in Lemma 2.15 is in W1,p(D;R2),
for allp∈[1,2[, and isC∞inD\{0}. We observe that the function ϕ◦φ−1is a cut-oﬀ function
onDwhich is identically equal to 1 on a neighborhood of 0. Denoting by Λ0the elastic modulus
tensor of the isotropic homogeneous body of Young modulus E(x′) and Poisson ratio ν(x′), we
have:
∀v∈W2,∞(R2;R2) with compact support ,/integraldisplay
{y<0}ε(u0) :Λ0ε(v) dx=T·v(0),
18(where T=R˜T). Therefore, we have:
∀v∈W2,∞(R2;R2) with compact support ,
/integraldisplay
{y<0}ε/parenleftbig(ϕ◦φ−1)u0/parenrightbig:Λ0ε(v) dx=T·v(0) +/integraldisplay
{y<0}Φ0(x)·v(x) dx+/integraldisplay
{y=0}τ0(x)·v(x) dx,
for some functions Φ0∈L∞andτ0∈L∞that depend on u0,ϕandφ, where we have used
the fact that ϕ◦φ−1∈W2,∞and it is 1 in a neighborhood of 0. Usingφto perform a change
of variable in the integrals of the above identity and applyi ng the rotation R−1, we get by a
standard calculation:
∀v∈W2,∞(Ω;R2),/integraldisplay
Ωε(˜ u0) :˜Λε(v) dx=
=˜T·v(x′) +/integraldisplay
Ω˜Φ(x)·v(x) dx+/integraldisplay
Γ˜τ(x)·v(x) dx,
where ˜Φand ˜τareL∞functions with support in Vx′. The conveyed elastic modulus tensor
˜Λsatisﬁes the usual symmetry and ellipticity properties, bu t does not need to be isotropic
homogeneous anymore. However, it is a W1,∞function. Note that we have ˜ u0∈W1,p(Ω;R2),
for allp∈[1,2[. Finally, we can write:
Λε(˜ u0) =˜Λε(˜ u0) +/parenleftig
Λ˜Λ−1−Id/parenrightig˜Λε(˜ u0).
As∇φ(x′) is a rotation, ˜Λ(x′) =Λ(x′) =Λ0, and the second term of the right-hand side is
the product of a W1,∞function which vanishes at x=x′and of aLp(for allp∈[1,2[) stress
ﬁeld ˜σ:=ε(˜ u0) such that div ˜σ+˜Φ=0in Ω and ˜σn=˜Tδx′+˜τon Γ. This is suﬃcient to
prove (2.6).
Step 3. Regularity with respect to x′of the trace of g(·,x′)onΓC. The function x′/ma√sto→˜g(·,x′)∈
C0(ΓC;H1/2(ΓC)). In addition, the function x′/ma√sto→g(·,x′)∈C0(ΓC;W1,p(Ω;R2)), for allp∈
[1,2[.
In Step 2, it was noted that the fundamental solution u0of Lemma 2.15 satisﬁes u0
|D∈
W1,p(D;R2), for allp∈[1,2[. Taking ¯xon the axis y= 0 in a neighborhood of 0, this classically
entails that ¯ x/ma√sto→u0(· −¯x)∈C0(]−ǫ,ǫ[ ;W1,p(D;R2)). Picking x′∈Γ :=∂Ω\ΓUand the
diﬀeomorphism φ:Vx′→Bas in Step 2, we consider an arbitrary x′′∈Vx′∩Γ and ¯x:=φ(x′′).
Using the fundamental solution u0(·−¯x) (withE(x′′) andν(x′′)) instead of u0(·) in the reasoning
made in Step 2, we can check that the functions x′/ma√sto→Φ(·,x′) andx′/ma√sto→τ(·,x′) are continuous
functions of x′with values in Lp(p∈[1,2[). Therefore, by (2.5) and (2.6) and the standard
regularity theory for elliptic boundary value problems, th e mapping x′/ma√sto→g(·,x′)−˜ u0(·,x′) is
continuous with respect to the H1norm. This is suﬃcient to obtain the conclusion of Step 3.
Step 4. Conclusion.
Consider an arbitrary t∈H−1/2(ΓC)∩M(ΓC). Setting
u(x) :=/integraldisplay
x′∈ΓCtg(x,x′), forx∈Ω,
where g(x,x′) is the function deﬁned in Step 1, we have u∈W1,p(Ω;R2), for allp∈[1,2[, by
Step 3. We have also:
∀v∈C∞(R2;R2) with v|ΓU=0/integraldisplay
Ωε(u) :Λε(v) dx=/integraldisplay
ΓCtvt.
19This entails that u∈H1(Ω;R2) and that the linear mapping t/ma√sto→uis continuous with respect
to the strong topologies of H−1/2(ΓC) andH1(Ω;R2). Clearly uis the unique minimizer on V
of:
v/ma√sto→1
2/integraldisplay
Ωε(v) :Λε(v) dx−/integraldisplay
ΓCtvt.
This concludes the proof. /square
Proof of Theorem 2.10.
Let us consider a sequence tk∈K(we recall that Kis the nonpositive cone of H−1/2(ΓC))
converging weakly in H−1/2(ΓC) towards a limit t∈K, and a sequence ˜tkinH−1/2(ΓC)∩M(ΓC)
such that |˜tk| ≤ −tkand converging weakly in H−1/2(ΓC) towards a limit ˜t. Bothtkand˜tkare
bounded measures on ΓC.
The proof is based on the expression of the operator L:t∈H−1/2(ΓC)∩M(ΓC)/ma√sto→un
provided by Lemma 2.21:
/angbracketleftbigtk,L(˜tk)/angbracketrightbig=/integraldisplay
x∈ΓCtk/integraldisplay
x′∈ΓC/bracketleftig
c(x′)h(x,x′) + ˜g(x,x′)/bracketrightig
˜tk,
wherec∈W1,∞(ΓC),htakes only the two values −1,+1 and is continuous on Γ C×ΓC\∆,
with ∆ := {(x,x)|x∈ΓC}being the diagonal, and where x′→˜g(·,x′)∈C0(ΓC;H1/2(ΓC)). As
tk∈H−1/2(ΓC), the sequence of functions:
x′/ma√sto→/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′)tk,
is a sequence of continuous functions on ΓCthat converges pointwisely towards the continuous
functionx′/ma√sto→/integraltext
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′)t. We are going to prove that the convergence is uniform on ΓC.
As the function x′→˜g(·,x′) is uniformly continuous on ΓC, givenǫ >0, there exist a ﬁnite
covering of ΓCwith ballsBxi,x′
i∈ΓC, such that:
∀x′∈Bxi∩ΓC,/vextenddouble/vextenddouble˜g(·,x′)−˜g(·,x′
i)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble
H1/2(ΓC)<ǫ.
Also, for large enough k, we have:
∀i,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′
i)tk−/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′
i)t/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<ǫ.
Denoting by M > 0 an upper bound of the bounded sequence /ba∇dbltk/ba∇dblH−1/2(ΓC)and gathering all
together, we obtain, for klarge enough:
∀x′∈ΓC,/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′)tk−/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′)t/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle<(2M+ 1)ǫ.
This is suﬃcient to conclude that:
lim
k→+∞/integraldisplay
x′∈ΓC˜tk/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′)tk/parenrightbigg
=/integraldisplay
x′∈ΓC˜t/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay
x∈ΓC˜g(x,x′)t/parenrightbigg
.
Now, there remains to obtain the same conclusion with c(x′)h(x,x′) instead of ˜ g(x,x′). Replacing
˜tkbyc˜tk, we may assume that c≡1 without loss of generality. Then, the proof runs essential ly
as the one of Theorem 2.17.
201. The sequence tkis a sequence which converges weakly in H−1/2(ΓC) and weakly-* in
M(ΓC) towardst. All these measures have no atoms in ΓC. Sincex/ma√sto→h(x,x′) has
bounded variation on ΓC, this entails the pointwise convergence of the following se quence
of continuous functions:
∀x′∈ΓC, lim
k→+∞/integraldisplay
x∈ΓCh(x,x′)tk=/integraldisplay
x∈ΓCh(x,x′)t,
as in the proof of Theorem 2.17.
2. The pointwise convergence is actually uniform on ΓC. This fact relies on the two following
properties.
• The pointwise limit x′/ma√sto→/integraltext
x∈ΓCh(x,x′)t, being continuous on the compact ΓC, is
uniformly continuous.
• The same reasoning as in Theorem 2.17 shows that the sequenc ex′/ma√sto→/integraltext
x∈ΓCh(x,x′)tk
converges strongly in C0(ΓC) towardsx′/ma√sto→/integraltext
x∈ΓCh(x,x′)t. More precisely, as Γ Cis
an open subset of the smooth curve ∂Ω, it has countably many connected components
Ii. If there are inﬁnitely many Ii’s, then, given ǫ>0, there exists ¯ n>0 such that:

x∈Iit<ǫ/ 3,
and therefore, there exists ¯k>0 such that:
∀k≥¯k, −+∞/summationdisplay
i=¯n/integraldisplay
x∈Iitk<2ǫ/3.
Hence,
∀k≥¯k,∀x′∈ΓC,

Iitk−+∞/summationdisplay
i=¯n/integraldisplay
Iit<ǫ,
ashtakes values in {−1,+1}andtk≤0. Therefore, it is now suﬃcient to prove that
the sequence of functions x′/ma√sto→/integraltext
x∈I0h(x,x′)tkconverges uniformly on ΓCto obtain
the expected conclusion. As,
∀x′∈ΓC\I0,/integraldisplay
x∈I0h(x,x′)tk−/integraldisplay
x∈I0h(x,x′)t=±/integraldisplay
x∈I0tk−t,
we only have to prove that the sequence of functions x′/ma√sto→/integraltext
x∈I0h(x,x′)tkconverges
uniformly on I0. AsI0is an open connected subset of the smooth curve ∂Ω, it can
be parametrized by the arc-length denoted by s∈]0,l[. With this notation, we have
eitherh(x,x′) = sgn(s−s′) orh(x,x′) =−sgn(s−s′) and it is now suﬃcient to prove
that the sequence of functions s′/ma√sto→/integraltext
s∈]0,l[sgn(s−s′)tkconverges uniformly on [0 ,l].
But the proof of this fact was already given in Theorem 2.17.
21Hence, we can conclude that:

x′∈ΓC˜tk/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay
x∈ΓCh(x,x′)tk/parenrightbigg

x′∈ΓC˜t/parenleftbigg/integraldisplay

,
and that the same result holds true with h(x,x′) replaced by c(x′)h(x,x′) + ˜g(x,x′). Recalling
the deﬁnition of c,h,˜gin the statement of Lemma 2.21, it turns out that the above equ ality is
nothing but the conclusion of Theorem 2.10 for the sequences tkand˜tk. /square
3 The case of anisotropic elasticity
In Section 2, the formal static Signorini-Coulomb problem ( 1.4) was reformulated as a variational
inequality in terms of a nonlinear operator A. Then, the path followed to prove the existence
of a solution to that variational inequality, and therefore to problem (1.4), was to prove that
this operator is coercive and Leray-Lions, that is, fulﬁls t he four properties deﬁning a Leray-
Lions operator (see Deﬁnition A.5 in Appendix A). Coercivit y and the ﬁrst three properties
were easily checked to hold in any space dimension and any cas e of isotropic or anisotropic
heterogeneous elasticity. However, the checking of the fou rth property deﬁning a Leray-Lions
operator turned out to be very tricky and required to prove a n ew ﬁne property of the elastic
Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. The ﬁne property was prove d to hold true for the bidimensional
case (N= 2) in the case of isotropic elasticity (either homogeneous or heterogeneous). In this
section, we discuss completely the extension to anisotropi c elasticity (still in the bidimensional
case). Surprisingly, the picture turns out to be diﬀerent fr om the isotropic case as a condition
on the friction coeﬃcient for the solvability of the Signori ni-Coulomb problem shows up: the
friction coeﬃcient must be smaller than a critical value. We show that our condition is optimal
by displaying a proof of nonexistence of a solution for frict ion coeﬃcients violating the condition.
This surprising feature of the coupling between friction an d anisotropic elasticity seems to have
remained unnoticed up to now.
This section is organized as follows. As the structure of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator
of the elastic half-space was shown in Subsection 2.3 to play a crucial role in the proof of the
ﬁne property for the bounded body of arbitrary geometry, we ﬁ rst provide the structure of the
Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator of the anisotropic bidimen sional half-space at the beginning of
Subsection 3.1 (Theorem 3.1). This is then exploited to prov e that the steady-sliding frictional
contact problem for the anisotropic half-space can have no s olution in the case of large friction
coeﬃcients, whereas this problem has a unique solution for a rbitrarily large friction coeﬃcients in
the isotropic case. The optimal condition on the friction co eﬃcient is supplied. In Subsection 3.2,
the solvability of the general anisotropic bidimensional S ignorini-Coulomb problem is proved
provided that this condition is fulﬁlled. The proof of Theor em 3.1, being technical, is postponed
to Subsection 3.3.
3.1 A frictional contact problem on the half-space with no so lution
In this section, Λ:M2×2
sym→M2×2
symdenotes an arbitrary linear operator, satisfying require-
ments (1.1) and (1.2), and constant (independent of x).
The corresponding Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator of the bi dimensional half-space has the
structure given by the following theorem, whose proof is pos tponed to Section 3.3. We will
identify the boundary R× {0}of the half-space R×R−withR. We will also use the indices n
22andtto denote the normal and tangential components of distribut ions deﬁned on R× {0}with
values in R2.
Theorem 3.1 Lett∈H−1/2(−1,1;R2)be a compactly supported surface traction distribution,
prescribed at the boundary of the bidimensional half-space . Then, all the tempered distributional
displacements u:R×R−→R2that satisfy the anisotropic elastic equilibrium equation s with
vanishing body forces are in H1
loc(R×R−;R2). They therefore have a trace on the boundary of
the half-space. The corresponding surface displacement re ads as:
un=−C1log|x| ∗tn−C2log|x| ∗tt−C3sgn(x)∗tt+an,
ut=−C4log|x| ∗tt−C2log|x| ∗tn+C3sgn(x)∗tn+at,
forx∈R, where C1,C2,C3,C4are uniquely determined real constants that are independen t
oft, and ais an aﬃne function that depends on four arbitrary real const ants (three of these
constants correspond to an overall rigid motion and the last one to a component of stress at
inﬁnity). The constants C1andC4must be positive and are therefore nonzero. Finally, the
mapping Λ/ma√sto→(C1,C2,C3,C4)is of classC∞.
In the particular case of isotropic elasticity,
C1=C4=2(1−ν2)
πE,C2= 0,C3=(1−2ν)(1 +ν)
2E,
whereν∈]−1,1/2[ is the Poisson ratio and E > 0 the Young modulus. The key diﬀerence
between isotropic and anisotropic elasticity is the fact th atC2can be nonzero in some cases of
anisotropic elasticity.
To demonstrate the impact of a possibly nonzero C2on the existence of solutions to frictional
contact problems, we consider the frictional contact probl em raised by a moving indentor steadily
sliding along the boundary of the half-space with given velo cityw/\e}atio\slash= 0. This problem was already
studied in the particular case of isotropic elasticity in [2 ]. The shape of the indentor is represented
by a given function g: ]−1,1[→Rso that the contact conditions in a frame moving with the
indentor read as:
tn≤0, u n≤g, t n(un−g) = 0.
As the indentor slides steadily along the boundary of the hal f-space, the Coulomb friction law
reduces to the following linear condition:
tt=−sgn(w)ftn.
In the sequel, the friction coeﬃcient f∈R+will be assumed to be constant, that is, independent
ofx. The arbitrary aﬃne function ain the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator plays no role and
will be taken as zero. The steady sliding frictional contact problem is now that of ﬁnding
un,tn: ]−1,1[→Rsuch that:
/braceleftigg
−/parenleftbigC1−sgn(w)fC2/parenrightbiglog|x| ∗tn+ sgn(w)fC3sgn(x)∗tn=un, in ]−1,1[,
tn≤0, u n≤g, t n(un−g) = 0, in ]−1,1[.
where the convolution product is understood in terms of the e xtension by zero of tnto the whole
line. The above formal contact problem is going to be formula ted as a variational inequality.
The following proposition, which we recall here from [3], pr ovides the appropriate functional
framework.
23Proposition 3.2 Fort∈H−1/2(−1,1), we have log|x| ∗t∈H1/2
loc(R)andsgn(x)∗t∈H1/2
loc(R),
so that the bilinear forms:
S(t1,t2) :=−/angbracketleftbiglog|x| ∗t1,t2/angbracketrightbig, A (t1,t2) :=/angbracketleftbigsgn(x)∗t1,t2/angbracketrightbig,
are well-deﬁned on H−1/2(−1,1). They are also continuous on H−1/2(−1,1). The bilinear
formAis skew-symmetric. The bilinear form Sis symmetric and positive deﬁnite. It therefore

H−1/2(−1,1) with the space of elements in H−1/2(R) whose support is contained in [ −1,1],

is equivalent to that of H−1/2(−1,1). To get the ﬁnal conclusion, it remains only to prove
thatSis positive deﬁnite on H−1/2(−1,1). Taking an arbitrary t∈H−1/2(−1,1), we have the

The following consequence is immediate.
Corollary 3.3 The following bilinear form:
a(t1,t2) :=/parenleftbigC1−sgn(w)fC2/parenrightbigS(t1,t2) + sgn(w)fC3A(t1,t2),
is continuous on H−1/2(−1,1). IfC1−sgn(w)fC2>0, thenais coercive on H−1/2(−1,1). If
C1−sgn(w)fC2<0, then −ais coercive on H−1/2(−1,1).
Under the hypothesis g∈H1/2(−1,1), the steady sliding frictional contact problem can now
be precisely formulated as a variational inequality.
Problem P. Findtn∈H−1/2(−1,1), such that tn≤0, and:
∀ˆt∈H−1/2(−1,1),such that ˆt≤0, a (tn,ˆt−tn)≥/angbracketleftbigg,ˆt−tn/angbracketrightbig.
When condition C1−sgn(w)fC2>0 is fulﬁlled, the bilinear form ais continuous and
coercive and the Lions-Stampacchia theorem [17, Theorem 4. 4] ensures that problem Phas
one and only one solution. This happens in particular for any value of the friction coeﬃcient
fin the case of isotropic elasticity (as C1>0 and C2= 0 in that case). However, for cases of
anisotropic elasticity where C2/\e}atio\slash= 0, one can have C1−sgn(w)fC2<0 whenever the friction
coeﬃcient is large enough. In that case, the bilinear form −ais coercive and there are many
examples of smooth shapes gof the indentor for which problem Phas no solution, as seen in
the next proposition.
Proposition 3.4 LetHbe a Hilbert space, K⊂Ha closed convex cone such that K\{0} /\e}atio\slash=∅
andK∩(−K) ={0}. Let alsoa:H×H→Rbe a continuous bilinear form such that −ais
coercive and let ˜g∈ −K\ {0}.
Then, there is no t∈Ksuch that:
∀ˆt∈K, a (t−˜g,ˆt−t)≥0.
Proof. Assume that there is such t∈K. As −˜g∈KandKis a cone,t−(˜g−t)∈K. Taking
t−(˜g−t) as a test function in the variational inequality, we get:
a(˜g−t,˜g−t)≥0.
As ˜g /∈K, we have ˜g/\e}atio\slash=t, and we obtain a contradiction since −ais coercive. /square
As a consequence, we get an optimal condition on the friction coeﬃcient to ensure the
solvability of the steady sliding frictional contact probl em.
25Corollary 3.5 IfC1−f|C2|>0, then problem Phas a unique solution for all indentor shape
g∈H1/2(−1,1). IfC1−f|C2| ≤0, then there are smooth indentor shapes gfor which problem P
has no solution.
Proof. The case C1−f|C2| /\e}atio\slash= 0 follows from the previous discussion. In the case C1−f|C2|= 0,
the bilinear form is skew-symmetric, which easily gives exa mples of nonexistence. /square
3.2 Existence in the case of anisotropic elasticity
As seen in Theorem 3.1, the normal component of the surface di splacement induced by a com-
pactly supported surface traction ( tn,tt) applied at the boundary of a (possibly anisotropic)
homogeneous elastic bidimensional half-space is given by:
un=−C1log|x| ∗/parenleftbigtn+ttC2/C1/parenrightbig−C3sgn(x)∗tt,
where C1>0,C2andC3are constants that depend only on the elastic modulus operat orΛ.
Settingα:=C2/C1, we have:
un=−C1log|x| ∗/parenleftbigtn+αtt/parenrightbig−C3sgn(x)∗tt,
so that the diﬀerence between isotropic and anisotropic ela sticity lies only in the possibility of
nonzeroα. It was seen in Section 3.1 that nonzero αhas a dramatic inﬂuence on the existence
of solutions to the frictional contact problem.
To be able to adapt Theorem 2.10 to the anisotropic case, we ne ed to have tnreplaced by
tn+αttin the Coulomb friction law. This drives us to use a nonorthog onal local basis on Γ C
instead of the ‘natural’ basis ( n,τ). This is the motivation of the following deﬁnitions. We
consider the following primal and dual basis:
e1:=n+ατ, e2:=τ,
e1:=n, e2:=τ−αn,
which clearly fulﬁls ei·ej=δj
i. Using this pair of bases, we have:
u=u1e1+u2e2, t=t1e1+t2e2, t·u=t1u1+t2u2,
with:
u1:=u·e1=un, u2:=u·e2=ut−αun,
t1:=t·e1=tn+αtt, t 2:=t·e2=tt.
Here, we emphasize that these identities are valid with αpossibly varying with x∈ΓC. This will
be the case as αis determined by Λ(x) and heterogeneous material will be possibly considered.
The aim of the following proposition is to reformulate the un ilateral contact condition and
the friction law in terms of t1,t2,u1,u2instead oftn,tt,un,ut.
26Proposition 3.6 Letf >0,g,α∈R, and t,u∈R2. We assume that 0≤ |α|f <1. Then, we
have (i) ⇐ ⇒ (ii) with:

negative parts.
Remark 3.7 The second line of (ii) is equivalent to the following condit ions
ft1
1 +αf≤t2≤ −ft1
1−αf,
u2+αg> 0 =⇒t2=ft1
1 +αf,
u2+αg< 0 =⇒t2=−ft1
1−αf.
Proof.
(i)=⇒(ii)
Assuming that (i)is fulﬁlled, we obviously have u1−g≤0 asu1=un. By (i), we have
|tt| ≤ −ftnwhich entails that t1=tn+αtt≤0, since 0 ≤ |α|f < 1. Ifu1=un< g then
tn=tt= 0 by (i), so thatt1= 0. The ﬁrst line of (ii)is proved. Furthermore,
ftn<tt<−ftn⇐ ⇒f(tn+αtt)
1 +αf<tt<−f(tn+αtt)
1−αf⇐ ⇒ft1
1 +αf<t2<−ft1
1−αf.
If one, and then, each of the previous conditions is satisﬁed , we haveun−g=ut= 0 by (i),
so thatu2+αg= 0. Iftn<0 andtt=−ftn, that is,t2=−ft1/(1−αf), thenun=g
andu2+αg=ut>0. Analogously, if tn<0 andtt=ftn, thent2=ft1/(1 +αf) and
u2+αg=ut<0. Finally, the second line of (ii)is fulﬁlled.
(ii)=⇒(i)
The proof follows the same lines as that of (i)=⇒(ii)and is left to the reader. /square
Deﬁnition 3.8 LetΩ⊂RNbe open, bounded, connected and of class C1,1. Consider an arbi-
trary Λ∈W1,∞(Ω)satisfying requirements (1.1) and(1.2). Taking an arbitrary x∈∂Ω, one
can always consider the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator for thehomogeneous elastic bidimen-
sional half-space with elastic modulus taken as Λ(x). Theorem 3.1 provides associated functions
C1(x),C2(x)∈W1,∞(∂Ω), with C1(x)>0. Settingα(x) :=C2(x)/C1(x), we have a well-deﬁned
functionα∈W1,∞(∂Ω)which is completely determined by Λ∈W1,∞(Ω). In the case of an
isotropic (possibly heterogeneous) material, the functio nαvanishes identically on ∂Ω.
27We assume N= 2 (bidimensional problem). For Λ∈W1,∞(Ω) andf∈W1,∞(ΓC) satisfying
the conditions:
f≥0, sup
x∈ΓCf(x)|α(x)|<1, (3.3)
and fort,τ∈K(Kwas deﬁned in formula (2.1)), we deﬁne the modiﬁed energy:

where t:=σ(u)ndenotes the associated surface traction on Γ C. To obtain the above variational
inequality, we have decomposed displacements and traction along the bases {ei}and{ej}and
used the change of variables ˆ v=vt−αvn+αg−wt. We deﬁne Aα(t,τ) :=u|ΓC·n=u1as the
normal part of the trace of uon Γ CandAαt:=Aα(t,t), so that:
Aα:K×K→H1/2(ΓC), Aα:K→H1/2(ΓC).
Thanks to Proposition 3.6, the static Signorini-Coulomb pr oblem (1.4) reduces, under condi-
tion (3.3), to ﬁnd t∈Ksuch that:
∀ˆt∈K,/angbracketleftbigAαt−g,ˆt−t/angbracketrightbig≥0,
whereg∈H1/2(ΓC).
Hence, the problem is reduced to prove that Aα:K→H1/2(ΓC) is coercive and Leray-Lions.
This is going to be done along the same lines as in the isotropi c case in Section 2.2. It is readily
checked that the conclusions of Propositions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 still holds true with the
operator Areplaced with Aα.
The key reason for considering operators AαandAαinstead ofAandAin the anisotropic
case is that Theorem 2.10 does not hold in the anisotropic cas e, due to the diﬀerent form of
the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator of the homogeneous elas tic bidimensional half-space (Theo-
rem 3.1). Instead, the following modiﬁed version holds true .
Theorem 3.9 LetN= 2,Λ∈W1,∞andαbe as in Deﬁnition 3.8. For ˜t∈H−1/2(ΓC)∩
M(ΓC), we denote by uthe unique minimizer on Vof:
v/ma√sto→1

ΓC˜tv2, (3.4)
and byun=u1∈H1/2(ΓC)the normal part of the trace of uonΓC. The linear mapping
˜t/ma√sto→un=u1=:Lα˜tis continuous for the strong topologies of H−1/2(ΓC)andH1/2(ΓC)(and
also for the weak topologies, as it is linear).
28Then, for any sequence tk∈Kconverging weakly in H−1/2(ΓC)towards a limit t∈K, and
any sequence ˜tk⇀˜tinH−1/2(ΓC)∩M(ΓC)such that |˜tk| ≤ −tk, we have:
lim
k→+∞/angbracketleftbigLα˜tk,tk/angbracketrightbig=/angbracketleftbigLα˜t,t/angbracketrightbig.
Proof. The minimizer of (3.4) fulﬁls t1=tn+αtt= 0 on Γ C. Then, proofs of Lemma 2.21 and
of Theorem 2.10 are straightforwardly adapted based on this property together with the form
of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator provided by Theorem 3 .1. /square
Corollary 3.10 LetN= 2,Λ∈W1,∞(Ω), andf∈W1,∞(ΓC)fulﬁlling condition (3.3). Let
τ∈K,tk⇀tbe a weakly convergent sequence in Ksuch that Aα(tk,τ)⇀F converges weakly

under the previous hypotheses, property (iv) of Deﬁnition A .5 holds true and the operator Aαis
a Leray-Lions operator.
Proof. Adapt the proof of Corollary 2.12 by invoking Theorem 3.9 ins tead of Theorem 2.10. /square
Bringing all together, and invoking Proposition A.6 in Appe ndix A, we have proved:
Theorem 3.11 LetN= 2,Λ∈W1,∞(Ω), andf∈W1,∞(ΓC)fulﬁlling condition (3.3). Then,
the operator Aαis a Leray-Lions operator and is therefore pseudomonotone. In addition, it is
coercive.
We can now rely on Brézis’s theorem (Theorem A.3 in Appendix A ) to solve variational
inequalities based on the operator A.
Theorem 3.12 LetN= 2,Λ∈W1,∞(Ω), andf∈W1,∞(ΓC)fulﬁlling condition (3.3),F∈
L2(Ω,RN),T∈L2(ΓT,RN),g∈H1/2(ΓC)andwt∈H1/2(ΓC;RN). Then, there exists t∈K
satisfying the variational inequality:
∀ˆt∈K,/angbracketleftbigAαt−g,ˆt−t/angbracketrightbig≥0.
It is readily checked that the unique minimizer u∈VofEt,tonV(see Deﬁnition 2.4) with
tgiven by Theorem 3.12, solves the formal static Signorini-C oulomb problem (1.4) (meaning
that, whenever the minimizer is smooth enough, the conditio ns are fulﬁlled pointwisely).
3.3 The Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator of the anisotropic e lastic bidimen-
sional half-space
The aim of this section is to provide a synthetic and self-con tained proof of Theorem 3.1. This
result is formally known in Solid Mechanics. A formal versio n can be found, for example, in [16,
Section 8.5]. For the historical background of this result, the reader should refer to that book.
Proof of Theorem 3.1.
Step 1. Preliminaries and notations.
29The orthonormal coordinate system ( x,y) will be used in the bidimensional space. We
consider an arbitrary displacement uwith components ux(x,y) anduy(x,y). We adopt the
following notation for the three independent entries of the matrix of the symmetric gradient ε:
ε1:=εxx=ux,x,
ε2:=εyy=uy,y,
ε3:=εxy=εyx= (ux,y+uy,x)/2,
where indices after a comma mean a derivative, as usual. A sim ilar convention is adopted for
the stress matrix σ:
σ1:=σxx, σ 2:=σyy, σ 3:=σxy=σyx,
so that an arbitrary anisotropic elastic modulus tensor Λcan now be represented by a positive
deﬁnite symmetric 3 ×3 matrix:


With this notation, the elastic equilibrium equations in th e whole space with body forces ( Fx,Fy)
read as:

Adopting convention (3.1) for deﬁning the Fourier transfor m, and denoting by ˆˆux(ξ,η) the
Fourier transform of uxwith respect to the pair ( x,y), we obtain the algebraic system:

Thanks to the positive deﬁniteness of Λ, the symmetric matrix M(ξ,η) appearing in this system
satisﬁes a strong ellipticity property:
∃α>0,∀(ξ,η),X∈R2,tX M (ξ,η)X≥α(ξ2+η2)|X|2
=⇒ ∀ (ξ,η)/\e}atio\slash= 0,∆(ξ,η) := det M(ξ,η)>0.(3.7)
Step 2. General form of the solutions of the elastic equilibrium equ ations in a half-space.
From now on, we look for uxanduythat are tempered distributions in the half-space {y<0}.
Denoting by ˆ ux(ξ,y) the Fourier transforms of uxwith respect to the variable xonly, the system
of ordinary diﬀerential equations for ˆ uxand ˆuyreads as:

We have ∆( ξ,η) =ξ4P(η/ξ), forξ/\e}atio\slash= 0, where ∆( ξ,η) is the determinant deﬁned in (3.7). The
polynomial Phas therefore no real root. As a consequence, the solutions o f the characteristic
equation (3.9) are two pairs of conjugate complex numbers, t hese two pairs being either distinct
(case 1) or identical (case 2).
Case 1. The characteristic equation (3.9) has two distinct pairs of complex conjugate roots,
sayα1±iσ1andα2±iσ2, where we can assume σ1>0 andσ2>0 without loss of
generality. On the one hand, all the solutions in ( R\ {0})×R−of the system (3.8)

Ak(ξ)eσk|ξ|yeiαkξy,(3.10)
we observe that the mapping ( A1(ξ),A2(ξ))/ma√sto→(ˆUx(ξ,0),ˆUx(ξ,0)) is linear, and the
corresponding matrix has all entries of the form Lij1+iLij2sgn(ξ). Such matrix is
invertible and its inverse matrix has all entries of the same structure. Indeed, assume
for simplicity ( A1,A2)∈C∞
c(R+). Then, one deﬁnes the inverse transform U(x,y)
ofˆU(ξ,y) with respect to ξ, and by Plancherel theorem and the energy equality one
ﬁnds that:

Therefore, ˆU(ξ,0)≡0implies that Uis a rigid motion and, taking into account formu-
lae (3.10), that U≡0. In conclusion, Ak(ξ)≡0 and the mapping ( A1(ξ),A2(ξ))/ma√sto→

Step 3. General form of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator of the ha lf-space.

where the Ci’s are uniquely determined by Λ,C1>0 and C4>0. Finally, taking ˆtx(ξ) =

2π,ˆty(ξ) =Ty/√
2πfor (Tx,Ty)∈R2in (3.14), all the tempered distributions Ux,Uyon

Using (3.2), it turns out that all the tempered distribution sux,uyin the half-space, that satisfy
the elastic equilibrium equations with vanishing body forc es and surface forces equal to ( Tx,Ty)δ
on the boundary have a trace on the boundary given by:
ux=−C4Txlog|x| −C2Tylog|x|+C3Tysgn(x) +ax(x),
uy=−C1Tylog|x| −C2Txlog|x| −C3Txsgn(x) +ay(x),
33where adenote an arbitrary aﬃne displacement in the half-space, wh ich is compatible with
boundary free of surface force (such an arbitrary displacem ent is determined by four arbitrary
real constants: three components of an overall rigid motion and one component of a constant
σxxstress). The contribution of Γ Eulin formulae (3.2) has been included in axanday. This
result is enough to obtain the form of the Neumann-to-Dirich let operator of the anisotropic
homogeneous half-space as given in Theorem 3.1.
Step 4. The maps Λ/ma√sto→Ciare of class C∞.
The preceding Steps 1, 2, 3 contain actually an eﬀective meth od of calculating the Ci’s
in terms of the entries of Λand the complex roots of the characteristic equation (3.9). The
expression can even be made explicit if desired. All the Ci’s are rational functions of the entries
ofΛand the complex roots of the characteristic equation (3.9). This does not readily give the
expected conclusion, as the roots of a polynomial are C∞functions of the coeﬃcients of the
polynomial only in the case where the roots are simple and the root functions do not even need
to be Lipschitz-continuous at a multiple root.
We are therefore going to provide an alternative expression of the Ci’s in terms of Λ, better
suited to prove the regularity of the dependence. The method runs as follows. We are going to
look for a tempered distribution uon the whole space R2, satisfying the elastic equilibrium with
body forces of the form F(x)δ(y) and adjust F(x) so that the restriction of uto the half-space
{y <0}is a fundamental solution for the Neumann problem on the half -space. We will prove
that all the fundamental solutions can be obtained by means o f an appropriate choice of the
distribution F(x) and, thus, get an alternative expression of the Ci’s in terms of Λ.

C0δ(ξ)δ(η) +C1δ′(ξ)δ(η) +C2δ(ξ)δ′(η), with Ci∈R2. This term represents an arbitrary aﬃne

The next step is now to ﬁnd ( ˆFx,ˆFy) such that:
ˆσxy(ξ,0−) =Tx√
2π, ˆσyy(ξ,0−) =Ty√
2π,
where (Tx,Ty) is arbitrarily ﬁxed in R2. We therefore have to prove that system (3.19) is
invertible and this is where the preliminary Steps 1, 2, 3 wil l be essential. Take ˆ σxy(ξ,0−) =
ˆσyy(ξ,0−) = 0 in system (3.19). Then, on the one hand, the restriction o fu(x,y) to the half-
space {y <0}solves an elasticity problem in that half-space with free bo undary. The analysis
in Step 1, 2, 3 shows that the restriction of the correspondin gu(x,y) to the half-space {y<0}
must be aﬃne so that ˆ u(ξ,0) = C0δ(ξ) +C1δ′(ξ), where C0,C1∈R2. On the other hand, by
system (3.19), we obtain:
ˆσxy(ξ,0+) = −ˆFx(ξ), ˆσyy(ξ,0+) = −ˆFy(ξ),
so that the restriction of u(x,y) to the half-space {y>0}solves a Neumann elastic problem on
that half-space with boundary data ( ˆFx(ξ),ˆFy(ξ)). As ˆ u(ξ,0) = C0δ(ξ) +C1δ′(ξ), the analysis
in Steps 1, 2, 3 shows that ( ˆFx,ˆFy) = (0,0). Hence, the 2 ×2 matrix appearing in system (3.19)
is invertible. We can therefore compute ( ˆFx,ˆFy) in terms of ( Tx,Ty):

36Appendix A: Pseudomonotone and Leray-Lions operators
LetBbe a reﬂexive Banach space, B∗its dual space, K⊂Ba nonempty closed convex subset,
f∈B∗andA:K→B∗. In [4], Brézis sought minimal conditions on Ato ensure the solvability
of the problem of ﬁnding u∈Ksatisfying the variational inequality:
∀v∈K,/angbracketleftbigAu−f,v−u/angbracketrightbig≥0. (A.20)
More precisely, Brézis sought the minimal conditions on Aensuring that a sequence of Galerkin
approximations for the solution of (A.20) can be built based on Brouwer’s theorem and that a
limit to a solution of (A.20) can be taken.
Deﬁnition A.1 A mapping A:K→B∗is said hemicontinuous if each real-valued function:
λ/ma√sto→/angbracketleftbigA/parenleftbigλu+(1−λ)v/parenrightbig, v−u/angbracketrightbigis continuous on [0,1]. The mapping A:K→B∗is said bounded
if it maps bounded subsets into bounded subsets. The mapping A:K→B∗is said monotone if
/a\}b∇acketle{tAu−Av,u −v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥0, for allu,v∈K.
Deﬁnition A.2 A mapping A:K→B∗is said pseudomonotone (in the sense of Brézis) if it is
bounded and if, for all weakly converging sequence un⇀u inK, such that lim sup /a\}b∇acketle{tAun,un−u/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≤
0, then we have:
∀v∈K, lim inf /a\}b∇acketle{tAun,un−v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht ≥ /a\}b∇acketle{tAu,u −v/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.
A mapping A:K→B∗is said coercive if:
lim
/bardblu/bardblB→+∞,
u∈K/a\}b∇acketle{tAu,u /a\}b∇acket∇i}ht
/ba∇dblu/ba∇dblB= +∞.
The motivation for the previous deﬁnition lies in the follow ing result due to Brézis [4, Corol-
lary 30].
Theorem A.3 (Brézis) LetA:K→B∗be a pseudomonotone, coercive operator. Then, for
allf∈B∗, the variational inequality (A.20) has at least one solution.
Pseudomonotone operators are a generalization of monotone operators in the following sense:
Proposition A.4 LetA:K→B∗be a bounded, hemicontinuous, monotone operator. Then,
Ais pseudomonotone.
Part of the success of Brézis’s result is due to the fact that t he class of pseudomonotone
operators encompasses the subclass of the so-called Leray- Lions operators previously introduced
in [12] in view of the study of certain nonlinear elliptic par tial diﬀerential equations.
Deﬁnition A.5 A mapping A:K→B∗is said to be a Leray-Lions operator, if it is bounded
and can be written as Au=A(u,u), for allu∈K, where A:K×K→B∗has the following
properties.
(i) For all u∈K, the mapping:/braceleftigg
K→B∗
v/ma√sto→A(u,v)
is bounded, hemicontinuous and satisﬁes the monotonicity p roperty:
∀v∈K,/angbracketleftbigA(u,u)−A(u,v), u−v/angbracketrightbig≥0.
37(ii) For all v∈K, the mapping u/ma√sto→A(u,v)is bounded, hemicontinuous from K⊂BtoB∗.
(iii) For all v∈K, ifun⇀u is a weakly converging sequence in K, such that lim/a\}b∇acketle{tA(un,un)−
A(un,u),un−u/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht= 0, then we have A(un,v)⇀A(u,v)weakly inB∗.
(iv) For all v∈K, ifun⇀u is a weakly converging sequence in K, such that A(un,v)⇀F
weakly inB∗, then we have lim/a\}b∇acketle{tA(un,v),un/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht=/a\}b∇acketle{tF,u/a\}b∇acket∇i}ht.
The proof of the following result is easy (see, for example, [ 17, Lemma 4.13])).
Proposition A.6 Every Leray-Lions operator A:K→B∗is pseudomonotone.
