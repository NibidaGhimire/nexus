To understand the multistage phase transitions in V-based k agome metals inside the charge-
density-wave (CDW) phase, we focus on the impact of the ”mixe d-type” Fermi surface because it
is intact in the CDW state on the ”pure-type” Fermi surface. O n the mixed-type Fermi surface,
moderate spin correlations develop, and we reveal that unif orm (q=0) bond order is caused
by the paramagnon interference mechanism, which is describ ed by the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex
correction. A dominant solution is the E2g-symmetry nematic order, in which the director can be
rotated arbitrarily. In addition, we obtain the A1g-symmetry order, which leads to the change in the
lattice constants without symmetry breaking. The predicte dE2gandA1gchannel ﬂuctuations at
q=0can be observed by the elastoresistance measurements. Thes e results are useful to understand
the multistage phase transitions inside the 2 ×2 CDW phase. The present theory has a general
signiﬁcance because mixed-type Fermi Surfaces (with multi orbital van-Hove singularities) exist in
various kagome lattice systems.
Introduction —Exoticelectronicstatesandcorrelation-
driven superconductivity in kagome metals AV 3Sb5
(A=K, Cs, and Rb) have attracted increasing attention.
Strong Coulomb interaction and the geometrical frustra-
tion of V site electrons (in Fig. 1(a)) give rise to exotic
quantum phase transition without magnetization. At
ambient pressure ( P= 0), AV 3Sb5exhibits 2 ×2 bond-
order (BO) at TBO= 78,94 and 102 K for A=K, Cs and
Rb, respectively [1–5]. The BO is the correlation-driven
modulation of the hopping integrals ( δtij) (Fig. 1(b)).
The superconducting (SC) state appears at Tc= 1∼3K
inside the BO phase [6, 7]. Under pressure, TBOgradu-
ally decreases, while Tcexhibits non-monotonic pressure
dependence [8]. The maximum Tc(∼10K) is realized
around the BO critical pressure PBO
c≈2GPa, consis-
tently with the BO ﬂuctuation pairing mechanism pro-
posed in Ref. [9]. The predicted s-wave superconductiv-
ity has been recently conﬁrmed by the penetration depth
and electron irradiation measurements [10, 11].
Rich symmetry-breaking states ”inside the BO phase”
have been a signiﬁcant open problem. For example, the
C6symmetry-breaking nematic state [12, 13] and the
time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) without spin
order [4, 14–18] have been reported. These states are
caused by the correlation-driven hopping integral modu-
lation:δtij. Thenematicorderisgivenbythebondorder
with real δtij, and the TRSB order is given by the imag-
inaryδtij. The latter accompanies topological charge-
current [19] that gives the giant anomalous Hall eﬀect
(AHE) [20, 21]. Theoretically, sizable oﬀ-site (beyond-
mean-ﬁeld) interaction [9, 22–46] leads to non-local order
parameters ( δtij/ne}ationslash= 0) in kagome metals.
At present, the possible onset temperatures of
symmetry-breaking states ”inside the BO phase” are un-
solved. One possible state, the TRSB order parame-
ter strongly develops below T∗= 35∼50K in theµ-SR [14, 16–18] and the AHE [20, 21] measurements.
As for another possibility, the nematic state, the scan-
ning birefringence study [13] reports Tnem≈TBO, while
Tnem≈35K is reported by the elastoresistance measure-
ment [12]. This discrepancy may indicate that the BO
layer stacking with π-shift leads to the weak nematicity
atTBO, and another nematic order emerges inside the
BO phase. The origin of the latter nematicity is not un-
derstood at present.
In V-based kagome metals, two major Fermi surfaces
(FSs) are composed of the b3g-orbitals and the b2g-
orbitals (Fig. 1(a)). The bandstructure and the FSs are
shown in Figs. 1(c) and (d), respectively. Both FSs give
large density-of-states (DOS) at the Fermi level due to
the van-Hove singularity (vHS) at three M points. Near
the Fermi level, the b3g-orbital FS is called the ”pure-
FS”, where each vHS point is composed of a single sub-
lattice; see Fig. 1(e). The vHS points are gapped by
the 2×2 BO on the pure-FS below TBO; see the un-
folded FS in Fig. 1(d). Previous theories have mainly
been devoted to understand the signiﬁcant roles of the
pure-type FS [9, 35–37] except for Refs. [41, 43]. How-
ever, one may expect that an additional phase transi-
tion below TBOwould occur on the b2g-orbital FS, the
mixed-type FS because it is not harmed by the BO. Its
sublattice weight is shown in Fig. 1(f), In addition, it
is notable that the mixed-type FS universally exists in
usual kagome lattice models. Therefore, the research on
the mixed-type FS is of great signiﬁcance.
In this paper, to understand the phase transitions be-
lowTBOin AV3Sb5, we focus on the impact ofthe mixed-
type FS because it is intact in the BO phase. On the
mixed-type FS, moderate antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin
correlations develop, which leads to the uniform ( q=0)
bond order by the paramagnon interference mechanism.
This beyond-mean-ﬁeld mechanism is described by the2

Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) vertex corrections. A dominant
BO solution is the E2g-symmetry nematic order in which
the director can be rotated arbitrarily. In addition, we
obtain the A1g-symmetry bond order which would ac-
company the change in the lattice constants. These re-
sults are useful to understand the multistage phase tran-
sitions inside the 2 ×2 BO phase.
Model Hamiltonian and Formulations. — In this let-
ter, we study the bond-order phase transition mediated
by the quantum ﬂuctuations in kagome lattice Hub-
bard model with a ”mixed-type” FS composed of three
b2gorbitals. We apply the density-wave (DW) equa-
tion method to derive the optimized order parameter
(= symmetry-breaking self-energy ∆Σ) driven by the
beyond-mean-ﬁeld vertex corrections. In Ref. [9], the
present authors studied the b2g+b3gorbital kagome lat-
ticeHubbardmodelforAV 3Sb5,andfoundthatthepure-
type FS alone gives the 2 ×2 BO state. However, the b2g
orbital FS can induce diﬀerent instabilities for T≪TBO.
For this reason, to ﬁnd the phase transition inside the
BO phase, we study the b2gorbital kagome lattice tight-binding Hubbard model.
Theb2gorbitals at sublattices A-C are shown in Fig.
1(a). The corresponding mixed-type FS is shown in
Fig. 1(d). The kinetic term of the b2gorbital model

In the mean-ﬁeld-level approximation, the spin insta-

main small in the pure-type case. The obtained χs(q)
is used to construct the kernel function of the DW equa-
tion,IL,M
q(k,p) in Eq. (1), which is a non-linear function
ofχs(q). We will show that the AFM spin ﬂuctuations
in the mixed-type FS give rise to the exotic ferro-bond
orders via the AL vertex corrections.

Density Wave equation analysis. — The nonmagnetic
DW orders cannot be obtained by RPA in the Hubbard
model with the on-site Coulomb interaction, because the

tex corrections in the DW equation (Fig 3(a)) give var-
ious charge-channel DW states due to the ”paramagnon3
interference processes”.
From a ﬁeld-theoretical point of view, the nonmag-
netic bond-order is described as the symmetry-breaking
self-energy ∆Σ, which is nothing but the DW order pa-
rameter [30]. (∆Σ is much smaller than the self-energy
without symmetry-breaking Σ 0.) Once ∆Σ emerges, it

χs(q) becomes positive when λ >1, so the nonmagnetic
bond-order occurs spontaneously. In the DW equation,
the form factor describes ∆Σ, and the AL terms give the
positive feedback eﬀect [47]. This theory was ﬁrst de-
veloped to explain the orbital nematic state in Fe-based
superconductors, and it has been applied to the cuprates
and the twisted-bilayer graphene successfully [30]. Re-
cently, the BO andcurrentorderedstatesin kagomemet-
als with pure-type band also have been explained by the
AL processes [9, 38].

the DW order at q=Q−Q′; see Fig. 3(b).

With the obtained spin susceptibility as the param-
agnon, we solve the DW equation. The q-dependence of
the eigenvalue λqatnmix= 1.6 (T= 0.02) is exhibited
in Figs. 3(c) and (d). (Here, we show λqonly on the
path Γ-Mbecauseλqon the path M-K-Γ is small.) Fig-
ure 3(c) [(d)] shows the result for αs= 0.9 (0.99), where
spin ﬂuctuation strength is moderate (strong). Impor-
tantly, the maximum peak position is located at q=0
in both cases. The obtained q=0order, which is very
diﬀerent from the nesting driven q/ne}ationslash= 0 order, is naturally
derived from the interference between two paramagnons
with wavevectors QandQ′(=Q) [30]. For αS= 0.9
in Fig. 3 (c), the largest two eigenvalues are degener-
ate, and the corresponding form factors are E2gsymme-
try BO; ( ˆfx2−y2(k),ˆfxy(k)). The corresponding diagonal4

TheE2gsymmetry BO gives the nematicity, and its
director can be rotated at any angle by taking the linear
combination of ˆfx2−y2(k) andˆfxy(k) [25]. To understand
the nature of the E2gsymmetry nematic state, we dis-
cuss the real-space form factor δtil,jmbased on Eq. (2).
When the wavevector is q=0,δtil,jmis simply written
asδtlm(r) withr≡ril−rjm. The obtained δtlm(r) for
flm
x2−y2(k) atq=0is shown in Fig. 4(a). (Its schematic
picture is given in Fig. 4(b).) It is plotted in two direc-
tions(AB and AC) fromsublatticeA, asafunction ofthe
distance R, where the distance between nearest sites is 1.
The BO along BC direction is the same as that along AC
direction. (The even-parity relation δtlm(R) =δtml(−R)
is veriﬁed.) δtllatR= 0 represents the onsite charge
modulation at sublattice l, andδtlmatR=±1 (l/ne}ationslash=m)
represents BO between the nearest sites.
A schematic picture of the hopping modulation due
to the nearest BO is given in Fig. 4(c). In this case,
the lattice structure will become nematic in the pres-
ence of ﬁnite electron-phonon coupling due to E2gacous-
tic mode. We also discuss the FS deformation due to
theE2gnematic BO, under the order parameter H′=

sinθˆfxy(k). The ordered nematic FS at θ= 0 with
∆E= 0.01 is showed in Fig. 4(d). By changing the
angleθ, the nematic FS can be rotated to any direction.
Another state, the A1gBO, does not break the sym-
metry of the system. However, it induces the FS defor-
mation due to the hopping modulation and the change
in the lattice constants should be accompanied through
the ﬁnite electron-phonon coupling. In SM B [48], we
present the nontrivial hopping modulation caused by the
A1gBO.
Figure 4(e) shows the T-dependence of λforE2gand
A1gstates, in the case of U= 1.95. The obtained λ
monotonically increases with decreasing T, while the in-
crement of αSis moderate (see Fig. 4(f)). Although the
obtained transition temperature is relatively high, it will
be reduced to below TBOby introducing the self-energy
eﬀect [47]. In fact, due to the ordinary self-energy Σ 0
which breaks no symmetry, the Green function is given
asG= 1/(iǫn−Σ0−ǫk)≈z/(iǫn−zǫk), where the mass-
enhancement factor z−1=m∗/mis larger than 1. The
factorzleads to the rescaling, T→zTandU→U/z,
under the condition of the ﬁxed αandλ[23]. Thus, the
transition temperature will be reduced by z. It is an im-
portant future issue to derive a reliable transition tem-
perature by taking account of the self-energy.
In the SM C [48], we discuss the important roles of the
AL and MT vertex corrections for the BO. We show that

the AL term gives large positive contribution for both
E2gandA1gBOs. In addition, it is found that the MT
term slightly favors the nodal A1gBO. Interestingly, the
same AL process leads to the q=0BO in mixed-type
FS model and 2 ×2 BO in the pure-type FS model.
Finally, we discuss the results of the existing elastore-
sistance experiments [49–51] based on the present theory.
In Ref. [49], signiﬁcant E2gsymmetry channel nematic
correlation is observed under TCDWand above a tran-
sition temperature Tnem∼35K. In contrast, in other
experiments[50, 51], strong enhancement of A1gchan-
nel susceptibility is reported below TCDWand presents
a phase transition at T∗∼20K. Importantly, both E2g
andA1ginstabilities develop in the mixed-type FS in the
present theory, and the leading instability can exchange.
Thus, diﬀerent experimentalresults may originatefrom a
slight sample dependence. Noteworthy, Ref. [52] reports
the nematic order is strongly stabilized under tiny (ex-
trinsic) strain in kagome metal. Thus, the DW equation
analysis for the “distorted kagome metal model” would5
be useful to understand the variety of the experimental
reports. This is an important future issue.
Summary. — We studied the phase transitions be-
lowTBOin AV 3Sb5by focusing on the mixed-type FS
that is intact in the BO phase. It is revealed that the
paramagnon interference mechanism leads to the uni-
form (q=0) bond order. A dominant solution is the
E2g-symmetry nematic order. We also obtain the A1g-
symmetry non-nematic order. These results are useful
to understand the multistage phase transitions inside the
2×2BOphase. Thistheoryhasageneralsigniﬁcancebe-
cause mixed-type like multi-sublattice FS exists in many
kagome metals, such as ATi 3Bi5[53]. In this case, the
intra-sublattice nesting gives rise to the AFM spin cor-
relation and such correlation leads to the paramagnon
interference. Thus, due to this mechanism, exotic bond
orders would occur in various kagome metals.

A: Formula of DW equation
We are going to give the formula of the kernel func-
tion of the DW equation here. In Eq. (1), the kernel
function IL,M
qis the irreducible four-point vertex. When
q= 0,IL,M
qis given by the Ward identity: IL,M
q=
−δΣL(k)/δGM(k′), where L≡(l,l′),Mi≡(mi,m′
i) rep-
resentthe pairofsublattice indices A, B, C. Σ is one-loop
ﬂuctuation exchange self-energy. The vertex correction
consistsofoneHartreeterm,onesingle-magnonexchange
MT term and two double-magnon interference AL1 and
AL2 terms. Their analytic expressions are given as

main text. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (S1) is the MT term
when the second and third terms are the AL terms. For
the higher order term, in the functional-renormalization-
group (fRG) study they have been proved unbiased to
the DW equation. [26, 27]
B:A1gmode
In the main text, we studied the possible phase transi-
tions in kagome lattice Hubbard model with mixed-type
FS by the DW equation. It was found that E2gandA1gsymmetry BOs can appear respectively under diﬀerent
spin Stoner factor αs. The obtained E2gBO form fac-
tor and its schematic picture are exhibited in Fig 4. In
contrast, the A1gmode breaks no symmetry. Here we
explain the obtained A1gsymmetry form factor and the
corresponding schematic picture. We choose αs= 0.975
(U= 2.21 andT= 0.02), which is reported in SM B [48]
as the transition point for two kinds of BOs.
FIG. S1. (a) Main hopping modulations δtlmforA1gmode
(αs= 0.975,T= 0.02). The corresponding hopping is in (b).
Only hopping modulations related to sublattice Aare shown
because A1gkeeps symmetry. The nearest neighbor hopping
and two long-range hoppings are exhibited. (b) Schematic
picture of A1gBO, showing two repulsive hoppings and a
long-range strong attractive one. The value of the hopping
modulation for diﬀerent number marks are shown in (a) re-
spectively.

As known from Fig. 3(d), the A1gstate’s maximum
eigenvalue also located at q= 0. Therefore, the real-
spaceA1gform factor δtil,jmbecomes intra-unit-cell, like
Fig. 4 for the E2gorder. The obtained δtlmis exhibited
in Fig. S1(a) with the three main values. Fig. S1(a)
is the obtained numerical results, showing one nearest
neighbor (bond 1) hopping modulation and two long-
range (bonds 2 and 3) hopping modulations; see Fig.
S1(b). TheschematicpictureoftheobtainedA1gorderis
shown in Fig. S1(b). It can be seen the nearest neighbor
hopping reduce. Importantly, long-range hopping modu-
lationsδtlmamong bonds 2 and 3 emerge irrespective of
the fact that the original tlmis zero. These two bonds
have opposite sign. Interestingly, the obtained δtlmex-
hibits the sign-change depending on the distance, and
|δtlm|is the largest for the next-nearest bonds. These
opposite modulations of nearest neighbor hopping and
long-range hoppings compete with each others.
Furthermore, the A1gBO will induce the A1gdefor-
mation of the FS due to the additional hopping 2 and 32
in Fig. S1(b). In addition, an isotropic lattice deforma-
tion will be induced below the A1gBO transition tem-
perature TA1g
BOthrough the ﬁnite electron-phonon cou-
pling since the minimum condition of the free energy
(Felectron+Flattice+Felectron −lattice) changes. Impor-
tantly, thepresenttheorynaturallyexplainstheenhance-
ment of the A1gchannel susceptibility observed in Ref.

C: Important Roles of the AL and MT Vertex
Corrections and the Quantum Interference
Mechanism
Here, we discuss the important roles of the AL and
MT vertex corrections for the nematic order. Figure S2
(a) shows the obtained λq=0for theE2gsolution and
theA1gsolution as functions of αsforT= 0.02. These
eigenvalues reach unity for αS∼0.9. With increasing
αS, the largest eigenvalue state changes from E2gBO to
A1gBOatαs∼0.975. (Simple chargeorderisprohibited
by the Hartree term.)
FIG. S2. (a) λq=0for theE2gsolution and that for the A1g
solution as functions of αsforT= 0.02. These eigenvalues
reach unity for αS∼0.9. With αs/lessorsimilar0.975, the E2gsolution
has the largest λ. Forαs/greaterorsimilar0.975, it is replaced with the A1g
solution. (b)(c) Eigenvalue contributed from the AL and MT
terms,λAL
qandλMT
q, respectively. (Note that λq=λAL
q+
λMT
q.) While the AL term gives the dominant contribution to
λq=0, the MT term plays an important role in determining
the symmetry and nodal structure of the form factor.
Figures S2 (b) and (c) give the eigenvalue contributed
from the AL and MT terms for the ﬁxed form factor, λAL
q
andλMT
q, respectively. (Note that λq=λAL
q+λMT
q.)
For both E2gandA1gchannels, the AL term gives large
positive contribution. In fact, the AL term can stabilize
general even-parity BOs, whose wavevector q=Q−Q′
(see Fig. 3 (b) in the main text) becomes zero or small
(minor) nesting vector [1]. The AL processes give the
relationλAL
E2g/greaterorsimilarλAL
A1g; see Fig. S2 (b). Thus, the nodal
A1gBO originates from the large MT term; see Fig. S2
(c). The A1gBO with λq=0∼1 will be realized if the
self-energy eﬀect reduces the eigenvalue[1].
Finally, we are going to discuss the diﬀerent BO arose
by mixed- and pure-type FS. The quantum interference
mechanism produces the nearest site BO in both the
mixed-type FS and the pure-type FS models. However,
the wavevector is q=0in the mixed-type FS and q/ne}ationslash=0
in the pure-type FS. To understand this diﬀerence, we
focus on the signiﬁcant role of the vHS points. Since the
vHS is composed of two sublattices in the mixed-type
FS, theq=0nearest site BO is eﬃciently realized by
the intra-vHS scattering. In contrast, in the pure-type
FS, the vHS is composed of a single sublattice, so the
inter-site BO should be given by the inter-vHS process
atq=qvHS1−qvHS2. Thus, we can understand the dif-
ferentBOs betweenboth FSs byusing the unique present
theory.
