Abstract
The orthogonality dimension of a graph Gover Ris the smallest integer kfor which one can
assign a nonzero k-dimensional real vector to each vertex of G, such that every two adjacent
vertices receive orthogonal vectors. We prove that for ever y sufﬁciently large integer k, it is
NP-hard to decide whether the orthogonality dimension of a giv en graph over Ris at most k
or at least 2(1−o(1))·k/2. We further prove such hardness results for the orthogonali ty dimension
over ﬁnite ﬁelds as well as for the closely related minrank pa rameter, which is motivated by
the index coding problem in information theory. This in part icular implies that it is NP-hard
to approximate these graph quantities to within any constan t factor. Previously, the hardness
of approximation was known to hold either assuming certain v ariants of the Unique Games
Conjecture or for approximation factors smaller than 3/2. T he proofs involve the concept of
line digraphs and bounds on their orthogonality dimension a nd on the minrank of their com-
plement.
1 Introduction
A graph Gis said to be k-colorable if its vertices can be colored by kcolors such that every two ad-
jacent vertices receive distinct colors. The chromatic num ber of G, denoted by χ(G), is the smallest
integer kfor which Gisk-colorable. As a fundamental and popular graph quantity, th e chromatic
number has received a considerable amount of attention in th e literature from a computational
perspective, as described below.
The problem of deciding whether a graph Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤3 is one of the classical twenty-
oneNP-complete problems presented by Karp [26] in 1972. Khanna, Lin ial, and Safra [28] proved
that it is NP-hard to distinguish between graphs Gthat satisfy χ(G)≤3 from those satisfying
χ(G)≥5. This result, combined with the approach of Garey and Johns on [15] and with a result of
Stahl [39], implies that for every k≥6, it isNP-hard to decide whether a graph Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤k
orχ(G)≥2k−2. Brakensiek and Guruswami [6] proved that for every k≥3, it isNP-hard to
distinguish between the cases χ(G)≤kand χ(G)≥2k−1, and the 2 k−1 bound was further
improved to 2 kby Barto, Bul´ ın, Krokhin, and Oprˇ sal [4]. For large values o fk, it was shown by
Khot [29] that it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤korχ(G)≥kΩ(logk), and
the latter condition was strengthened to χ(G)≥2k1/3by Huang [24]. A substantial improvement

1was recently obtained by Wrochna and ˇZivn ´y [40], who proved that for every k≥4, it isNP-
hard to decide whether a given graph Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤korχ(G)≥(k
⌊k/2⌋). The proof of this
result combined the hardness result of [24] with the constru ction of line digraphs [20] and with a
result of Poljak and R¨ odl [36]. Note that under certain vari ants of the Unique Games Conjecture,
stronger hardness results are known to hold, namely, hardne ss of deciding whether a given graph
Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤k1orχ(G)≥k2for all integers k2>k1≥3 [10] (see also [11]).
The present paper studies the computational complexity of a lgebraic variants of the chromatic
number of graphs. A k-dimensional orthogonal representation of a graph G= (V,E)over a ﬁeld
Fis an assignment of a vector uv∈Fkwith/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tuv,uv/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0 to each vertex v∈V, such that for
every two adjacent vertices vand v′it holds that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tuv,uv′/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0. Here, for two vectors x,y∈Fk,
we consider the standard inner product deﬁned by /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tx,y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=∑k
i=1xiyiwith operations over F. The
orthogonality dimension of Gover F, denoted by ξF(G), is the smallest integer kfor which G
admits a k-dimensional orthogonal representation over F(see Remark 2.2). It can be easily seen
that for every graph Gand for every ﬁeld F, it holds that ξF(G)≤χ(G). In addition, if Fis a
ﬁxed ﬁnite ﬁeld or the real ﬁeld R, it further holds that ξF(G)≥Ω(logχ(G)). Both bounds are
known to be tight in the worst case (see Claim 2.8 and [33, Chap ter 10]). The study of orthogonal
representations and orthogonality dimension was initiate d in the seminal work of Lov´ asz [32] on
theϑ-function and has found applications in various areas, e.g. , information theory [32], graph
theory [34], and quantum communication complexity [9, Chap ter 8.5].
The interest in the hardness of determining the orthogonali ty dimension of graphs dates back
to a paper of Lov´ asz, Saks, and Schrijver [34], where it was n oted that the problem seems difﬁcult.
The aforementioned relations between the chromatic number and the orthogonality dimension
yield that hardness of deciding whether a graph Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤k1orχ(G)≥k2implies the
hardness of deciding whether it satisﬁes ξF(G)≤k1orξF(G)≥Ω(logk2), provided that Fis
a ﬁnite ﬁeld or R. It therefore follows from [10] that assuming certain varia nts of the Unique
Games Conjecture, it is hard to decide whether a graph Gsatisﬁes ξF(G)≤k1orξF(G)≥k2
for all integers k2>k1≥3. This reasoning, however, does not yield NP-hardness results for the
orthogonality dimension (without additional complexity a ssumptions), even using the strongest
knownNP-hardness results of the chromatic number. Yet, a result of P eeters [35] implies that for
every ﬁeld F, it isNP-hard to decide if a given graph Gsatisﬁes ξF(G)≤3, hence it is NP-hard
to approximate the orthogonality dimension of a graph over Fto within any factor smaller than
4/3. Over the reals, the hardness of approximation for the or thogonality dimension was recently
extended in [16] to any factor smaller than 3/2.
Another algebraic quantity of graphs is the minrank paramet er that was introduced in 1981 by
Haemers [19] in the study of the Shannon capacity of graphs. T he minrank parameter was used
in [18, 19] to answer questions of Lov´ asz [32] and was later a pplied by Alon [1], with a different
formulation, to disprove a conjecture of Shannon [38]. The m inrank of a graph Gover a ﬁeld F,
denoted by minrk F(G), is closely related to the orthogonality dimension of the co mplement graph
Gover Fand satisﬁes minrk F(G)≤ξF(G). The difference between the two quantities comes,
roughly speaking, from the fact that the deﬁnition of minrank involves the notion of orthogonal bi-
representations rather than orthogonal representations ( for the precise deﬁnitions, see Section 2.1).
The study of the minrank parameter is motivated by various ap plications in information theory
and in theoretical computer science. A prominent one is the w ell-studied index coding problem,
2for which the minrank parameter perfectly characterizes th e optimal length of its linear solutions,
as was shown by Bar-Yossef, Birk, Jayram, and Kol [3] (see Sect ion 2.2).
Similarly to the situation of the orthogonality dimension, it was proved in [35] that for every
ﬁeld F, it isNP-hard to decide if a given graph Gsatisﬁes minrk F(G)≤3. It was further shown
by Dau, Skachek, and Chee [8] that it is NP-hard to decide whether a given digraph Gsatisﬁes
minrk F2(G)≤2. Note that for (undirected) graphs, the minrank over any ﬁel d is at most 2 if
and only if the complement graph is bipartite, a property tha t can be checked in polynomial time.
Motivated by the computational aspects of the index coding pr oblem, Langberg and Sprintson [30]
related the minrank of a graph to the chromatic number of its c omplement and derived from [10]
that assuming certain variants of the Unique Games Conjectu re, it is hard to decide whether a
given graph Gsatisﬁes minrk F(G)≤k1or minrk F(G)≥k2, provided that k2>k1≥3 and that F
is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. Similar hardness results were obtained in [30] for additional settings of the index
coding problem, including the general (non-linear) index c oding problem over a constant-size
alphabet.
1.1 Our Contribution
This paper provides improved NP-hardness of approximation results for the orthogonality d imen-
sion and for the minrank parameter over various ﬁelds. We star t with the following result, which
is concerned with the orthogonality dimension over the real s.
Theorem 1.1. There exists a function f :N→Nsatisfying f (k) = 2(1−o(1))·k/2such that for every
sufﬁciently large integer k, it is NP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes
ξR(G)≤k or ξR(G)≥f(k).
Theorem 1.1 implies that it is NP-hard to approximate the orthogonality dimension of a graph
over the reals to within any constant factor. Previously, su ch anNP-hardness result was known to
hold only for approximation factors smaller than 3/2 [16].
We proceed with the following result, which is concerned wit h the orthogonality dimension
and the minrank parameter over ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Theorem 1.2. For every ﬁnite ﬁeld F, there exists a function f :N→Nsatisfying f (k) = 2(1−o(1))·k/2
such that for every sufﬁciently large integer k, the following h olds.
1. It isNP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes ξF(G)≤k orξF(G)≥f(k).
2. It isNP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes minrk F(G)≤k orminrk F(G)≥f(k).
Theorem 1.2 implies that over any ﬁnite ﬁeld, it is NP-hard to approximate the orthogonality di-
mension and the minrank of a graph to within any constant fact or. Let us stress that this hardness
result relies solely on the assumption P/\e}atio\slash=NPrather than on stronger complexity assumptions
and thus settles a question raised in [30]. Prior to this work , it was known that it is NP-hard to
approximate the minrank of graphs to within any factor small er than 4/3 [35] and the minrank of
digraphs over F2to within any factor smaller than 3/2 [8].
A central component of the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 is th e notion of line digraphs,
introduced in [20], that was ﬁrst used in the context of hardne ss of approximation by Wrochna
3and ˇZivn ´y [40] (see also [17]). It was shown in [21, 36] that the chroma tic number of any graph
is exponential in the chromatic number of its line digraph. T his result was iteratively applied
by the authors of [40] to improve the NP-hardness of the chromatic number from the kvs. 2k1/3
gap of [24] to their kvs.(k
⌊k/2⌋)gap. The main technical contribution of the present work lie s
in analyzing the orthogonality dimension of line digraphs a nd the minrank parameter of their
complement. We actually show that on line digraphs, these gr aph parameters are quadratically
related to the chromatic number. This allows us to derive our hardness results from the hardness
of the chromatic number given in [40], where the obtained gap s are only quadratically weaker. We
further discuss some limitations of our approach, involvin g an analogue of Sperner’s theorem for
subspaces due to Kalai [25].
To demonstrate our combinatorial contribution, consider a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fand a graph G, and
letHdenote the underlying graph of the line digraph associated w ithG(see Deﬁnition 3.1). It
is shown in [21, 36] that χ(H)is the smallest integer nsuch that χ(G)≤(n
⌊n/2⌋). In particular, if
χ(G)≤(n
⌊n/2⌋)then ξF(H)≤χ(H)≤n. On the other hand, we prove that if ξF(H)≤nthen
χ(G)≤ |F|n2, which implies that
ξF(H)≥/radicalBig
log|F|χ(G).
By combining these bounds, it follows that ξF(H)and χ(H)are quadratically related. Results of
this nature are also proved for the orthogonality dimension over the reals and for the minrank
parameter over ﬁnite ﬁelds (see Theorems 3.5, 3.7, and 3.13).
We ﬁnally show that our approach might be useful for proving ha rdness results for the general
(non-linear) index coding problem over a constant-size alp habet, for which no NP-hardness result
is currently known. It was shown by Langberg and Sprintson [3 0] that for an instance of the index
coding problem represented by a graph G, the length of an optimal solution is at most χ(G)and
at least Ω(log log χ(G)). It thus follows that an NP-hardness result for the chromatic number with
a double-exponential gap would imply an NP-hardness result for the general index coding prob-
lem. However, no such NP-hardness result is currently known for the chromatic numbe r without
relying on further complexity assumptions. To tackle this i ssue, we study the index coding prob-
lem on instances which are complement of line digraphs (see T heorem 3.17). As a consequence of
our results, we obtain that the NP-hardness of the general index coding problem can be derived
from anNP-hardness result of the chromatic number with only a single- exponential gap, not that
far from the best known gap given in [40]. For a precise statem ent, see Theorem 4.7.
1.2 Related Work
We gather here several related results from the literature.
• A result of Zuckerman [41] asserts that for any ε>0, it isNP-hard to approximate the
chromatic number of a graph on nvertices to within a factor of n1−ε. It would be interesting
to ﬁgure out if such a hardness result holds for the orthogonal ity dimension and for the
minrank parameter. The present paper, however, focuses on t he hardness of gap problems
with constant thresholds, independent of the number of vert ices.
4• As mentioned earlier, Peeters [35] proved that for every ﬁel dF, it isNP-hard to decide if the
minrank (or the orthogonality dimension) of a given graph is at most 3. We note that for
ﬁnite ﬁelds, this can also be derived from a result of Hell and Ne ˇ setˇ ril [23].
• For the chromatic number of hypergraphs, the gaps for which NP-hardness is known to hold
are much stronger than for graphs. For example, it was shown i n [5] that for some δ>0, it
isNP-hard to decide if a given 4-uniform hypergraph Gonnvertices satisﬁes χ(G)≤2 or
χ(G)≥logδn. An analogous result for the orthogonality dimension of hyp ergraphs over R
was proved in [22].
• On the algorithmic side, a long line of work has explored the number of colors that an efﬁ-
cient algorithm needs for properly coloring a given k-colorable graph, where k≥3 is a ﬁxed
constant. For example, there exists a polynomial-time algo rithm that on a given 3-colorable
graph with nvertices uses O(n0.19996)colors [27]. Algorithms of this nature exist for the
graph parameters studied in this work as well. Indeed, there exists a polynomial-time algo-
rithm that given a graph Gonnvertices with ξR(G)≤3 ﬁnds a proper coloring of Gwith
O(n0.2413)colors [22]. Further, there exists a polynomial-time algor ithm that given a graph
Gonnvertices with minrk F2(G)≤3 ﬁnds a proper coloring of Gwith O(n0.2574)colors [7].
1.3 Outline
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we collect several deﬁnitions and results
that will be used throughout this paper. In Section 3, we stud y the underlying graphs of line
digraphs and their behavior with respect to the orthogonali ty dimension, the minrank parameter,
and the index coding problem. We also discuss there some limi tations of our approach, given
in Sections 3.1.2 and 3.2.1. Finally, in Section 4, we prove o ur hardness results and complete the
proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2.
2 Preliminaries
For an integer n, we use the notation [n] ={1, 2, . . . , n}. All the logarithms are in base 2 unless
otherwise speciﬁed. Throughout the paper, undirected graph s are referred to as graphs, and di-
rected graphs are referred to as digraphs. All the considere d graphs and digraphs are simple. A
homomorphism from a graph G1= (V1,E1)to a graph G2= (V2,E2)is a function g:V1→V2
such that for every two vertices x,y∈V1with{x,y} ∈E1, it holds that {g(x),g(y)} ∈E2.
2.1 Orthogonality Dimension and Minrank
For a ﬁeld F, an integer k, and two vectors x,y∈Fk, let/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tx,y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=∑k
i=1xiyidenote the standard
inner product of xand yover F. If/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tx,y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0 then the vectors xand yare called orthogonal (over
F). If/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tx,x/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0 then the vector xis called self-orthogonal (and otherwise, non-self-ortho gonal).
The orthogonality dimension of a graph is deﬁned as follows (s ee, e.g., [33, Chapter 11]).
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Orthogonality Dimension) .A k-dimensional orthogonal representation of a graph
G= (V,E)over a ﬁeld Fis an assignment of a vector u v∈Fkwith/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tuv,uv/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0to each vertex v ∈V,
5such that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tuv,uv′/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0whenever v and v′are adjacent vertices in G. The orthogonality dimension of a
graph G over a ﬁeld F, denoted by ξF(G), is the smallest integer k for which there exists a k-dimensio nal
orthogonal representation of G over F.
Remark 2.2. We note that orthogonal representations are sometimes deﬁne d in the literature such that the
vectors associated with non-adjacent vertices are required to be orthogonal, that is, as orthogona l represen-
tations of the complement graph. While we ﬁnd it more convenient to use the other deﬁnition in this paper,
one can view the notation ξF(G)as standing for ξF(G), i.e., the orthogonality dimension of the complement
graph.
The orthogonality dimension of graphs can be equivalently e xpressed in terms of graph ho-
momorphisms. This requires the following family of graphs.
Deﬁnition 2.3. For a ﬁeld Fand an integer k, let O(F,k)denote the graph whose vertices are all the
non-self-orthogonal vectors in Fk, where two distinct vectors are adjacent if they are orthogonal over F.
The following characterization of the orthogonality dimen sion follows directly from Deﬁni-
tions 2.1 and 2.3.
Proposition 2.4. For every ﬁeld Fand for every graph G, ξF(G)is the smallest integer k for which there
exists a homomorphism from G to O(F,k).
It follows from Proposition 2.4 that the orthogonality dime nsion over a ﬁeld Fis monotone under
homomorphisms, namely, if there exists a homomorphism from a graph G1to a graph G2, then
ξF(G1)≤ξF(G2).
The minrank parameter, introduced in [19], is deﬁned as follo ws.
Deﬁnition 2.5 (Minrank) .Let G= (V,E)be a digraph on the vertex set V = [n], and let Fbe a ﬁeld.
We say that a matrix M ∈Fn×nrepresents G if M i,i/\e}atio\slash=0for every i ∈V, and M i,j=0for every distinct
vertices i ,j∈V such that (i,j)/∈E. The minrank of G over Fis deﬁned as
minrk F(G) =min{rank F(M)|M represents G over F}.
The deﬁnition is naturally extended to graphs by replacing eve ry edge with two oppositely directed edges.
We next describe an alternative deﬁnition, due to Peeters [35 ], for the minrank of graphs. This
requires the following family of graphs.
Deﬁnition 2.6. For a ﬁeld Fand an integer k, let O′(F,k)denote the graph whose vertices are all the pairs
(u,w)∈Fk×Fksuch that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0, where two distinct pairs (u1,w1)and(u2,w2)are adjacent if they
satisfy/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu1,w2/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu2,w1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0.
Proposition 2.7 ([35]) .For every ﬁeld Fand for every graph G, minrk F(G)is the smallest integer k for
which there exists a homomorphism from G to O′(F,k).
It follows from Proposition 2.7 that the minrank of the compl ement over a ﬁeld Fis monotone
under homomorphisms, namely, if there exists a homomorphis m from a graph G1to a graph G2,
then minrk F(G1)≤minrk F(G2).
The following claim summarizes some known relations betwee n the studied graph parame-
ters. We provide a quick proof for completeness.
6Claim 2.8. For every ﬁeld Fand for every graph G, it holds that
minrk F(G)≤ξF(G)≤χ(G).
In addition, if Fis ﬁnite, then
minrk F(G)≥log|F|χ(G).
Proof: The inequality minrk F(G)≤ξF(G)follows by combining Propositions 2.4 and 2.7 with
the fact that for every integer k, the graph O(F,k)admits a homomorphism to the graph O′(F,k),
mapping any vertex uto the pair (u,u).
For the inequality ξF(G)≤χ(G), combine Proposition 2.4 with the fact that for every intege r
k, the complete graph on kvertices admits a homomorphism to the graph O(F,k), mapping the
ith vertex to the ith vector of the standard basis of Fk.
Next, assuming that Fis ﬁnite, we show that minrk F(G)≥log|F|χ(G). By Proposition 2.7,
it sufﬁces to show that for every integer k, the graph O′(F,k)admits a proper coloring with |F|k
colors. To see this, assign to every vertex (u,w)ofO′(F,k)the vector uas a color. Notice that
for two adjacent vertices (u1,w1)and(u2,w2)ofO′(F,k), it holds that u1/\e}atio\slash=u2, because u1is
orthogonal to w2whereas u2is not. This completes the proof.
2.2 Index Coding
The index coding problem, introduced in [3], is concerned wi th economical strategies for broad-
casting information to nreceivers in a way that enables each of them to retrieve its ow n message, a
symbol from some given alphabet Σ. For this purpose, each receiver is allowed to use some prior
side information that consists of a subset of the messages re quired by the other receivers. The
side information map is naturally represented by a digraph o n[n], which includes an edge (i,j)if
theith receiver knows the message required by the jth receiver. The objective is to minimize the
length of the transmitted information. For simplicity, we c onsider here the case of symmetric side
information maps, represented by graphs rather than by digr aphs. The formal deﬁnition follows.
Deﬁnition 2.9 (Index Coding) .Let G be a graph on the vertex set [n], and let Σbe an alphabet. An index
code for G over Σof length k is an encoding function E :Σn→Σksuch that for every i ∈[n], there exists
a decoding function g i:Σk+|NG(i)|→Σ, such that for every x ∈Σn, it holds that g i(E(x),x|NG(i)) = xi.
Here, N G(i)stands for the set of vertices in G adjacent to the vertex i, and x |NG(i)stands for the restriction
of x to the indices of N G(i). IfΣis a ﬁeld Fand the encoding function E is linear over F, then we say that
the index code is linear over F.
Bar-Yossef et al. [3] showed that the minrank parameter char acterizes the length of optimal
solutions to the index coding problem in the linear setting.
Proposition 2.10 ([3]).For every ﬁeld Fand for every graph G, the minimal length of a linear index code
for G over Fisminrk F(G).
2.3 Computational Problems
Throughout the paper, we consider computational decision p roblems associated with several
graph quantities: chromatic number, orthogonality dimens ion over a given ﬁeld, minrank over
7a given ﬁeld, and the minimal length of an index code over a give n alphabet. The problems are
considered in their promise version, deﬁned as follows. Let ψbe a graph quantity, and let k1<k2
be two integers. We consider the problem of deciding whether a graph Gsatisﬁes ψ(G)≤k1or
ψ(G)≥k2. In this problem, the input is a graph Gthat is promised to satisfy either ψ(G)≤k1
orψ(G)≥k2, where in the former case, Gis referred to as a YES instance, and in the latter as a
NOinstance. The goal is to distinguish between the two cases. N ote that if this problem is NP-
hard, then it is NP-hard to approximate the value of ψ(G)for a given graph Gto within any factor
smaller than k2/k1.
3 Line Digraphs
In 1960, Harary and Norman [20] introduced the concept of lin e digraphs, deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Line Digraph) .For a digraph G = (V,E), the line digraph of G, denoted by δG, is the
digraph on the vertex set E that includes a directed edge from a v ertex(x,y)to a vertex (z,w)whenever
y=z.
Deﬁnition 3.1 is naturally extended to graphs Gby replacing every edge of Gwith two oppositely
directed edges. Note that in this case, the number of vertice s in δGis twice the number of edges
inG. We will frequently consider the underlying graph of the dig raph δG, i.e., the graph obtained
from δGby ignoring the directions of the edges.
The following result of Poljak and R¨ odl [36], which strengt hens a previous result of Harner and
Entringer [21], shows that the chromatic number of a graph Gprecisely determines the chromatic
number of the underlying graph of δG. The statement of the result uses the function b:N→N
deﬁned by b(n) =(n
⌊n/2⌋).
Theorem 3.2 ([21, 36]) .Let G be a graph, and let H be the underlying graph of the digrap hδG. Then,
χ(H) =min{n|χ(G)≤b(n)}.
Using the fact that b(n)∼2n√
πn/2, Theorem 3.2 implies that the chromatic number of Gis expo-
nential in the chromatic number of H. Our goal in this section is to relate the chromatic number
ofGto other graph parameters of H, namely, the orthogonality dimension, the minrank of the
complement, and the optimal length of an index code for the co mplement.
3.1 Orthogonality Dimension
For a ﬁeld F, an integer n, and a subspace UofFn, we denote by U⊥the subspace of Fnthat
consists of the vectors that are orthogonal to Uover F, i.e.,
U⊥={w∈Fn| /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw,u/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0 for every u∈U}.
Consider the following family of graphs.
Deﬁnition 3.3. For a ﬁeld Fand an integer n, let S(F,n)denote the graph whose vertices are all the
subspaces of Fn, where two distinct subspaces U 1and U 2are adjacent if there exists a vector w ∈Fnwith
/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0that satisﬁes w ∈U1∩U⊥
2and, in addition, there exists a vector w′∈Fnwith/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw′,w′/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0
that satisﬁes w′∈U2∩U⊥
1.
8In words, two subspaces of Fnare adjacent in the graph S(F,n)if each of them includes a non-
self-orthogonal vector that is orthogonal to the entire oth er subspace. Note that for an inﬁnite ﬁeld
Fand for n≥2, the vertex set of S(F,n)is inﬁnite.
We argue that the chromatic number of a graph Gcan be used to estimate the orthogonality
dimension of the underlying graph Hof its line digraph δG. First, recall that by Theorem 3.2, the
chromatic number of His logarithmic in χ(G). This implies, using Claim 2.8, that the orthogo-
nality dimension of Hover any ﬁeld is at most logarithmic in χ(G). For a lower bound on the
orthogonality dimension of H, we need the following lemma that involves the graphs S(F,n).
Lemma 3.4. LetFbe a ﬁeld, let G be a graph, let H be the underlying graph of the di graph δG, and let
n be an integer. Then, H admits a homomorphism to O(F,n)if and only if G admits a homomorphism to
S(F,n).
Proof: PutG= (VG,EG)and H= (VH,EH). Recall that the vertices of H, just like the vertices of
δG, are the ordered pairs (x,y)of adjacent vertices x,yinG.
Suppose ﬁrst that there exists a homomorphism hfrom HtoO(F,n). Consider the function g
that maps every vertex y∈VGto the subspace g(y), spanned by the image of hon the vertices of
Hwhose head is y, namely,
g(y) =span({h(v)|v= (x,y)∈VHfor some x∈VG}).
We claim that gforms a homomorphism from GtoS(F,n). Clearly, gmaps every vertex of VG
to a subspace of Fn, and thus to a vertex of S(F,n). Further, let x,y∈VGbe adjacent vertices
inG, and consider the vector w=h(x,y)assigned by hto the vertex (x,y)ofH. Since wis a
vertex of O(F,n), it holds that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0. Since(x,y)is a vertex of Hwhose head is y, it follows
that w∈g(y). Further, every vertex of Hof the form (x′,x)for some x′∈VGis adjacent in H
to(x,y), hence, since his a homomorphism to O(F,n), it holds that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{th(x′,x),w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0. Since the
subspace g(x)is spanned by those vectors h(x′,x), we obtain that wis orthogonal to the entire
subspace g(x). It thus follows that the vector wsatisﬁes/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0 and w∈g(y)∩g(x)⊥. By
symmetry, there also exists a vector w′∈Fnsatisfying /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw′,w′/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0 and w′∈g(x)∩g(y)⊥, hence
the subspaces g(x)and g(y)are adjacent vertices in S(F,n), as required.
For the other direction, suppose that there exists a homomor phism gfrom GtoS(F,n). Con-
sider the function hthat maps every vertex (x,y)∈VHofHto some non-self-orthogonal vector
h(x,y)that lies in the intersection g(x)∩g(y)⊥. Note that such a vector exists, because xand y
are adjacent in G, hence g(x)and g(y)are adjacent in S(F,n). We claim that hforms a homomor-
phism from HtoO(F,n). Clearly, hmaps every vertex of VHto a non-self-orthogonal vector of
Fn, and thus to a vertex of O(F,n). Further, for every two adjacent vertices (x,y),(y,z)∈VHof
H, it holds that h(x,y)∈g(y)⊥and h(y,z)∈g(y), and thus /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{th(x,y),h(y,z)/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0. This implies
that h(x,y)and h(y,z)are adjacent in O(F,n), so we are done.
We will use Lemma 3.4 to obtain lower bounds on the orthogonal ity dimension of the underly-
ing graphs of line digraphs. To this end, we need upper bounds on the chromatic numbers of the
graphsS(F,n). Every vertex of S(F,n)is a subspace of Fnand thus can be represented by a basis
that generates it. For a ﬁnite ﬁeld F, the number of possible bases does not exceed |F|n2, which
9obviously yields that χ(S(F,n))≤ |F|n2. While this simple bound sufﬁces for proving our hard-
ness results for the orthogonality dimension over ﬁnite ﬁelds , we note that the number of vertices
inS(F,n)is in fact |F|(1+o(1))·n2/4, where the o(1)term tends to 0 when ntends to inﬁnity.1
We conclude this discussion with the following theorem.
Theorem 3.5. LetFbe a ﬁnite ﬁeld, let G be a graph, and let H be the underlying graph of the digraph δG.
Then, it holds that
ξF(H)≥/radicalBig
log|F|χ(G).
Proof: Put n=ξF(H). By Proposition 2.4, Hadmits a homomorphism to O(F,n), hence by
Lemma 3.4, Gadmits a homomorphism to S(F,n). Since the chromatic number is monotone
under homomorphisms, it follows that χ(G)≤χ(S(F,n))≤ |F|n2. By rearranging, the proof is
completed.
3.1.1 The Chromatic Number of S(R,n)
For the real ﬁeld Rand for n≥2, the vertex set of the graph S(R,n)is inﬁnite, and yet, its
chromatic number is ﬁnite. To see this, let us ﬁrstly observe a s imple upper bound of 23n. To each
vertex of S(R,n), i.e., a subspace UofRn, assign the subset of {0,±1}nthat consists of all the
sign vectors of the vectors of U. This assignment forms a proper coloring of the graph, becau se for
adjacent vertices Uand Vthere exists a nonzero vector w∈Uthat is orthogonal to V, hence the
sign vector of wbelongs to the set of sign vectors of Ubut does not belong to the one of V(because
the inner product of two vectors with the same nonzero sign ve ctor is positive). Since the number
of subsets of {0,±1}nis 23n, it follows that χ(S(R,n))≤23n.
The above double-exponential bound is not sufﬁcient for deri vingNP-hardness of approxima-
tion results for the orthogonality dimension over Rfrom the currently known NP-hardness results
of the chromatic number. We therefore need the following lem ma that provides an exponentially
better bound which is suitable for our purposes. For a vector w∈Rn, we use here the notation
/⌊ard⌊lw/⌊ard⌊l=/radicalbig
/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htfor the Euclidean norm of w.
Lemma 3.6. For every integer n, it holds that χ(S(R,n))≤(2n+1)n2.
Proof: We deﬁne a coloring of the vertices of the graph S(R,n)as follows. For every vertex of
S(R,n), i.e., a subspace UofRn, let(u1, . . . , uk)be an arbitrary orthonormal basis of Uwhere
k≤n, and assign Uto the color c(U) = ( u′
1, . . . , u′
k)where u′
iis a vector obtained from uiby
rounding each of its values to a closest integer multiple of1
n. Note that for every i∈[k], the
vectors uiand u′
idiffer in every coordinate by no more than1
2nin absolute value.
We claim that cis a proper coloring of S(R,n). To see this, let Uand Vbe adjacent vertices
in the graph. If dim (U)/\e}atio\slash=dim(V)then it clearly holds that c(U)/\e}atio\slash=c(V). So suppose that the
dimensions of Uand Vare equal, and put k=dim(U) =dim(V). Denote the orthonormal bases
associated with Uand Vby(u1, . . . , uk)and(v1, . . . , vk)respectively, and let c(U) = ( u′
1, . . . , u′
k)
and c(V) = ( v′
1, . . . , v′
k)be their colors. Our goal is to show that c(U)/\e}atio\slash=c(V).
1To see this, put q=|F|, and observe that the number of k-dimensional subspaces of Fnis precisely ∏k−1
i=0qn−qi
qk−qi
and that every term in this product lies in [qn−k−1,qn−k+1]. Hence, the total number of subspaces of Fnis at least
∑n
k=0q(n−k−1)kand at most ∑n
k=0q(n−k+1)k. It follows that the number of subspaces of Fnisq(1+o(1))·n2/4.
10Assume for the sake of contradiction that c(U) = c(V), that is, u′
i=v′
ifor every i∈[k]. This
implies that for every i∈[k], the vectors uiand vidiffer in each coordinate by no more than1
nin
absolute value, hence
/⌊ard⌊lui−vi/⌊ard⌊l ≤/radicalbigg
n·1
n2=1√n. (1)
Since Uand Vare adjacent in the graph S(R,n), by scaling, there exists a unit vector u∈U∩V⊥.
Write u=∑i∈[k]αi·uifor coefﬁcients α1, . . . , αk∈R. Since the given basis of Uis orthonormal, it
follows that ∑i∈[k]α2
i=/⌊ard⌊lu/⌊ard⌊l2=1. Now, consider the vector v=∑i∈[k]αi·vi, and observe that vis
a unit vector that belongs to the subspace V. Observe further that
/⌊ard⌊lu−v/⌊ard⌊l=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble∑
i∈[k]αi·(ui−vi)/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤∑
i∈[k]|αi|·/⌊ard⌊lui−vi/⌊ard⌊l ≤/parenleftBig
∑
i∈[k]α2
i/parenrightBig1/2
·/parenleftBig
∑
i∈[k]/⌊ard⌊lui−vi/⌊ard⌊l2/parenrightBig1/2
≤1, (2)
where the ﬁrst inequality follows from the triangle inequali ty, the second from the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality, and the third from (1) using k≤n. However, uand vare orthogonal unit vectors, and
as such, the distance between them satisﬁes /⌊ard⌊lu−v/⌊ard⌊l=√
2. This yields a contradiction to (2),
hence c(U)/\e}atio\slash=c(V).
To complete the proof, we observe that the number of colors us ed by the proper coloring cdoes
not exceed (2n+1)n2. Indeed, every color can be represented by an n×nmatrix whose values are
of the forma
nfor integers −n≤a≤n(where the matrix associated with a subspace of dimension
kconsists of the rounded kcolumn vectors concatenated with n−kcolumns of zeros). Since the
number of those matrices is bounded by (2n+1)n2, we are done.
We derive the following theorem.
Theorem 3.7. There exists a constant c >0, such that for every graph G with χ(G)≥3, the underlying
graph H of the digraph δG satisﬁes
ξR(H)≥c·/radicalbigg
logχ(G)
log log χ(G).
Proof: Put n=ξR(H). By Proposition 2.4, Hadmits a homomorphism to O(R,n), hence by
Lemma 3.4, Gadmits a homomorphism to S(R,n). Using Lemma 3.6, we obtain that
χ(G)≤χ(S(R,n))≤(2n+1)n2,
which yields the desired bound.
3.1.2 The Clique Number of S(F,n)
We next consider the clique numbers of the graphs S(F,n), whose estimation is motivated by the
following lemma. Here, the clique number of a graph Gis denoted by ω(G).
Lemma 3.8. LetFbe a ﬁeld, let G be a graph, and let H be the underlying graph of th e digraph δG. If
χ(G)≤ω(S(F,n)), then ξF(H)≤n.
11Proof: Putm=ω(S(F,n)), and let U1, . . . , Umbemsubspaces of Fnthat form a clique in S(F,n).
PutG= (V,E), suppose that χ(G)≤m, and let c:V→[m]be a proper coloring of G. Notice
that for every two adjacent vertices x,yinG, the subspaces Uc(x)and Uc(y)are adjacent vertices in
S(F,n).
We deﬁne an n-dimensional orthogonal representation of Hover Fas follows. Recall that
every vertex of His a pair (x,y)of adjacent vertices x,yinG. Assign every such vertex (x,y)
to some non-self-orthogonal vector u(x,y)that lies in Uc(y)∩U⊥
c(x). The existence of such a vector
follows from the adjacency of the vertices Uc(x)and Uc(y)inS(F,n). We claim that this assign-
ment is an orthogonal representation of H. Indeed, for adjacent vertices (x,y)and(y,z)inH, the
vector u(x,y)belongs to Uc(y)whereas the vector u(y,z)is orthogonal to Uc(y), hence they satisfy
/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu(x,y),u(y,z)/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0. Since this orthogonal representation lies in Fn, we establish that ξF(H)≤n.
For a graph Gand for the underlying graph Hof its line digraph δG, Theorem 3.2 implies
that if χ(G)≤(n
⌊n/2⌋)then χ(H)≤n, and thus, by Claim 2.8, ξF(H)≤nfor every ﬁeld F. This
raises the question of whether Lemma 3.8 can be used to obtain a better upper bound on ξF(H)
as a function of χ(G). For certain cases, the following result answers this quest ion negatively.
Namely, it shows that the clique number of the graphs S(F,n)is precisely (n
⌊n/2⌋), whenever the
vector space Fnhas no nonzero self-orthogonal vectors (as in the case of F=R). It thus follows
that Lemma 3.8 cannot yield a better relation between the qua ntities ξR(H)and χ(G)than the one
stemming from Theorem 3.2.
Proposition 3.9. For a ﬁeld Fand an integer n such that Fnhas no nonzero self-orthogonal vectors, it
holds that
ω(S(F,n)) =/parenleftbiggn
⌊n/2⌋/parenrightbigg
.
The proof of Proposition 3.9 relies on the following result o f Kalai [25] (see also [31]).
Theorem 3.10 ([25]) .For a ﬁeld Fand an integer n, let (U1,W1), . . . ,(Um,Wm)be m pairs of subspaces
ofFnsuch that
1. U i∩Wi={0}for every i ∈[m], and
2. U i∩Wj/\e}atio\slash={0}for every i /\e}atio\slash=j∈[m].
Then, m≤(n
⌊n/2⌋).
Proof of Proposition 3.9: We ﬁrst show that there exists a clique in S(F,n)of size(n
⌊n/2⌋). For
every set A⊆[n]of size|A|=⌊n/2⌋, let UAdenote the subspace of Fnspanned by the vectors
eiwith i∈A, where eistands for the vector of Fnwith 1 on the ith entry and 0 everywhere else.
It clearly holds that for every distinct such sets A1,A2, there exists some i∈A1\A2, and that the
vector eisatisﬁes/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tei,ei/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=1 and ei∈UA1∩U⊥
A2. It thus follows that the (n
⌊n/2⌋)subspaces UAwith
|A|=⌊n/2⌋form a clique in the graph S(F,n), as required.
We next show that the size of every clique in S(F,n)does not exceed (n
⌊n/2⌋). To see this, let
U1, . . . , Umbe subspaces of Fnthat form a clique in S(F,n). Consider the pairs (Ui,U⊥
i)fori∈[m],
and observe that they satisfy the conditions of Theorem 3.10 . Indeed, for every i∈[m]it holds
that Ui∩U⊥
i={0}, because Fnhas no nonzero self-orthogonal vectors. Further, since the given
12collection of subspaces is a clique in S(F,n), for every i/\e}atio\slash=j∈[m], there exists a vector w∈Fn
with/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0 such that w∈Ui∩U⊥
j, hence, Ui∩U⊥
j/\e}atio\slash={0}. It thus follows from Theorem 3.10
that m≤(n
⌊n/2⌋), as required.
3.2 Minrank
As in the previous section, we start with a deﬁnition of a famil y of graphs.
Deﬁnition 3.11. For a ﬁeld Fand an integer n, let S′(F,n)denote the graph whose vertices are all the
pairs of subspaces of Fn, where two distinct pairs (U1,W1)and(U2,W2)are adjacent if there exist two
vectors u ,w∈Fnwith/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0such that u ∈U1∩W⊥
2and w∈W1∩U⊥
2and, in addition, there
exist two vectors u′,w′∈Fnwith/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu′,w′/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0such that u′∈U2∩W⊥
1and w′∈W2∩U⊥
1.
We next argue that the chromatic number of a graph Gcan be used to estimate the minrank
of the complement of the underlying graph of its line digraph δG. This is established using the
following lemma that involves the graphs S′(F,n). Its proof resembles that of Lemma 3.4.
Lemma 3.12. LetFbe a ﬁeld, let G be a graph, let H be the underlying graph of the di graph δG, and let
n be an integer. Then, H admits a homomorphism to O′(F,n)if and only if G admits a homomorphism to
S′(F,n).
Proof: PutG= (VG,EG)and H= (VH,EH). Suppose ﬁrst that there exists a homomorphism h
from HtoO′(F,n). For every vertex y∈VGofG, letUydenote the subspace of Fnspanned by the
vectors uof the pairs (u,w)that lie in the image of hon the vertices of Hwhose head is y, namely,
Uy=span({u|(u,w) =h(x,y)for some (x,y)∈VHand w∈Fn}).
Similarly, let Wydenote the subspace of Fnspanned by the vectors wof the pairs (u,w)that lie in
the image of hon the vertices of Hwhose head is y, namely,
Wy=span({w|(u,w) =h(x,y)for some (x,y)∈VHand u∈Fn}).
Consider the function gthat maps every vertex y∈VGofGto the pair g(y) = ( Uy,Wy). We
claim that gforms a homomorphism from GtoS′(F,n). Clearly, gmaps every vertex of VGto
a pair of subspaces of Fn, and thus to a vertex of S′(F,n). Further, let x,y∈VGbe adjacent
vertices in G, and consider the pair (u,w) = h(x,y)assigned by hto the vertex (x,y)ofH. Since
(u,w)is a vertex of O′(F,n), it holds that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0. Since (x,y)is a vertex of Hwhose head
isy, it follows that u∈Uyand w∈Wy. Further, every vertex of Hof the form (x′,x)for some
x′∈VGis adjacent in Hto(x,y). Put(˜u,˜w) = h(x′,x), and observe that the fact that his a
homomorphism to the graph O′(F,n)implies that /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{t˜u,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu,˜w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=0. Since the subspaces Ux
and Wxare spanned, respectively, by those vectors ˜uand ˜w, we obtain that uis orthogonal to the
subspace Wxand wis orthogonal to the subspace Ux. It thus follows that the vectors uand wsatisfy
/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0,u∈Uy∩W⊥
x, and w∈Wy∩U⊥
x. By symmetry, there also exist vectors u′,w′∈Fn
satisfying /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu′,w′/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0,u′∈Ux∩W⊥
y, and w′∈Wx∩U⊥
y, hence the pairs g(x) = ( Ux,Wx)and
g(y) = ( Uy,Wy)are adjacent vertices in S′(F,n), as required.
For the other direction, suppose that there exists a homomor phism gfrom GtoS′(F,n). Con-
sider the function hdeﬁned as follows. For every vertex (x,y)∈VHofH, consider the pairs
13g(x) = ( Ux,Wx)and g(y) = ( Uy,Wy), and let h(x,y)be a pair (u,w), where uand ware vectors
satisfying /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tu,w/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht /\e}atio\slash=0,u∈Ux∩W⊥
y, and w∈Wx∩U⊥
y. Note that such a pair exists, because x
and yare adjacent in G, hence g(x)and g(y)are adjacent in S′(F,n). We claim that hforms a ho-
momorphism from HtoO′(F,n). Clearly, hmaps every vertex of VHto a pair of non-orthogonal
vectors of Fn, and thus to a vertex of O′(F,n). Further, let (x,y),(y,z)∈VHbe two adjacent
vertices of H, and put g(y) = ( Uy,Wy). Notice that the ﬁrst vector of h(x,y)lies in W⊥
yand that
the second vector of h(y,z)lies in Wy, hence they are orthogonal. Similarly, the second vector
ofh(x,y)lies in U⊥
yand the ﬁrst vector of h(y,z)lies in Uy, hence they are orthogonal too. This
implies that h(x,y)and h(y,z)are adjacent in O′(F,n), so we are done.
We derive the following theorem.
Theorem 3.13. LetFbe a ﬁnite ﬁeld, let G be a graph, and let H be the underlying graph of the digraph
δG. Then, it holds that
minrk F(H)≥/radicalBig
1
2·log|F|χ(G).
Proof: Putn=minrk F(H). By Proposition 2.7, Hadmits a homomorphism to O′(F,n), hence
by Lemma 3.12, Gadmits a homomorphism to S′(F,n). Since the chromatic number is monotone
under homomorphisms, it follows that
χ(G)≤χ(S′(F,n))≤ |F|2n2,
where the second inequality holds because the number of vert ices inS′(F,n)does not exceed
|F|2n2. By rearranging, the proof is completed.
3.2.1 The Chromatic Number of S′(R,n)
We next consider the problem of determining the chromatic nu mbers of the graphs S′(R,n). The
following theorem shows that these graphs cannot be properl y colored using a ﬁnite number of
colors, in contrast to the graphs S(R,n)addressed in Lemma 3.6.
Theorem 3.14. For every integer n ≥3, it holds that χ(S′(R,n)) = ∞.
Before proving Theorem 3.14, let us describe a signiﬁcant dif ference between the behavior of
ξR(G)and of minrk R(G)with respect to the chromatic number χ(G). It is not difﬁcult to see that
the chromatic number of a graph Gis bounded from above by some function of ξR(G). Indeed, the
graphO(R,n)is 3n-colorable, as follows from the coloring that assigns to eve ry nonzero vector
ofRnits sign vector from {0,±1}n. By Proposition 2.4, this implies that every graph Gsatisﬁes
χ(G)≤3ξR(G)(see also [33, Chapter 11]). On the other hand, the chromatic number of a graph G
cannot be bounded from above by any function of minrk R(G), as proved below.
Theorem 3.15. For every integer m, there exists a graph G such that minrk R(G)≤3and yet χ(G)≥m.
Proof: For an integer n>6, consider the ‘double shift graph’ Gndeﬁned as follows. Its vertices
are all the 3-subsets of [n], where two sets {x1,x2,x3}and{y1,y2,y3}with x1<x2<x3and
y1<y2<y3are adjacent in Gnif either(x2,x3) = ( y1,y2)or(x1,x2) = ( y2,y3). It was shown
in [13] that the graph Gnsatisﬁes χ(Gn) = ( 1+o(1))·log log n(see also [14]), whereas its local
14chromatic number, a concept introduced by Erd¨ os et al. [12] , is known to be 3. By an argument
of Shanmugam, Dimakis, and Langberg [37, Theorem 1], this im plies that minrk R(Gn)≤3 (see
also [2, Proposition 6.5]). This completes the proof.
We are ready to derive Theorem 3.14.
Proof of Theorem 3.14: It clearly sufﬁces to prove the assertion of the theorem for n=3. Con-
sider the subgraph of S′(R, 3)induced by the pairs (U,W)of subspaces of R3such that Uand W
are non-orthogonal subspaces of dimension 1, and observe th atO′(R, 3)admits a homomorphism
to this subgraph. By Proposition 2.7, for every graph Gwith minrk R(G)≤3, there exists a ho-
momorphism from GtoO′(R, 3)and thus χ(G)≤χ(O′(R, 3)). By Theorem 3.15, the chromatic
number of a graph Gwith minrk R(G)≤3 can be arbitrarily large, hence χ(O′(R, 3)) = ∞. Since
O′(R, 3)admits a homomorphism to a subgraph of S′(R, 3), this yields that χ(S′(R, 3)) = ∞, as
required.
3.3 Index Coding
In this section, we study the optimal length of (not necessar ily linear) index codes for the comple-
ment of underlying graphs of line digraphs. Recall Deﬁnition 2.9.
We start by presenting an argument of Langberg and Sprintson [30, Theorem 4(a)] that relates
the chromatic number of a graph to the length of an index code f or its complement. In fact, we
slightly modify their argument to obtain the improved bound stated below (with 2|Σ|krather than
|Σ||Σ|kin the statement of the result).
Proposition 3.16. LetΣbe an alphabet of size at least 2, and let G be a graph. If there exists an index code
forG over Σof length k, then χ(G)≤2|Σ|k.
Proof: Assume without loss of generality that {0, 1} ⊆ Σ. Put G= (V,E)and n=|V|. Suppose
that there exists an index code for Gover Σof length k, and let E:Σn→Σkand gi:Σk+|NG(i)|→Σ
fori∈Vdenote the corresponding encoding and decoding functions.
For every vertex i∈V, we deﬁne a function hi:Σk→ { 0, 1}that determines for a given
encoded message y∈Σkwhether gireturns 0 on ywhen all the symbols of the side informa-
tion of the ith receiver are zeros. Formally speaking, for every y∈Σk, we deﬁne hi(y) = 0 if
gi(y, 0, . . . , 0) =0, and hi(y) =1 otherwise.
We claim that the assignment of the function hito each vertex i∈Vforms a proper coloring
ofG. To see this, let iand jbe adjacent vertices in G. Let x∈Σndenote the vector with 1 in the
ith entry and 0 everywhere else, and put y=E(x). By the correctness of the decoding functions,
it follows that gi(y,x|NG(i)) = xi=1 whereas gj(y,x|NG(j)) = xj=0. Since iand jare adjacent in
G, they are not adjacent in G, hence all the symbols in the side information x|NG(i)ofiand in the
side information x|NG(j)ofjare zeros. This implies that gi(y, 0, . . . , 0) = 1 and gj(y, 0, . . . , 0) = 0,
and therefore hi(y) =1 and hj(y) =0, which yields that hi/\e}atio\slash=hj, as required. Finally, observe that
the number of distinct functions hi:Σk→ { 0, 1}fori∈Vdoes not exceed 2|Σ|k, implying that
χ(G)≤2|Σ|k.
We proceed by proving an analogue of Proposition 3.16 for lin e digraphs.
15Theorem 3.17. LetΣbe an alphabet of size at least 2, let G be a graph, and let H be the underlying graph
of the digraph δG. If there exists an index code for H over Σof length k, then χ(G)≤2|Σ|k.
Proof: Assume without loss of generality that {0, 1} ⊆ Σ. Put G= (VG,EG),H= (VH,EH),
and n=|VH|. Recall that the vertices of Hare the ordered pairs of adjacent vertices in G, hence
n=2·|EG|. Suppose that there exists an index code for Hover Σof length k, and let E:Σn→Σk
and g(u,v):Σk+|NH(u,v)|→Σfor(u,v)∈VHdenote the corresponding encoding and decoding
functions.
For every vertex v∈VG, we deﬁne a function hv:Σk→ { 0, 1}that determines for a given
encoded message y∈Σkwhether every function g(u,v)associated with a vertex (u,v)∈VHreturns
0 on ywhen all the symbols in the side information of the receiver o f the vertex (u,v)are zeros.
Formally speaking, for every y∈Σk, we deﬁne hv(y) = 0 if for every u∈VGwith(u,v)∈VH, it
holds that g(u,v)(y, 0, . . . , 0) =0, and hv(y) =1 otherwise.
We claim that the assignment of the function hvto each vertex v∈VGforms a proper coloring
ofG. To see this, let v1and v2be adjacent vertices in G, and notice that (v1,v2)is a vertex of H. Let
x∈Σndenote the vector with 1 in the entry of (v1,v2)and 0 everywhere else, and put y=E(x).
We ﬁrst claim that hv1(y) = 0. To see this, consider any vertex (u,v1)∈VH, and notice
that(u,v1)and(v1,v2)are adjacent in Hand are thus not adjacent in H. By the correctness
of the decoding function g(u,v1), it follows that g(u,v1)(y,x|NH(u,v1)) = x(u,v1)=0. Since (u,v1)
and(v1,v2)are not adjacent in H, all the symbols in the side information x|NH(u,v1)of the vertex
(u,v1)are zeros. We thus obtain that for every vertex u∈VGwith(u,v1)∈VH, it holds that
g(u,v1)(y, 0, . . . , 0) =0. By the deﬁnition of hv1, it follows that hv1(y) =0, as required.
We next claim that hv2(y) = 1. To see this, observe that by the correctness of the decodin g
function g(v1,v2), it follows that g(v1,v2)(y,x|NH(v1,v2)) = x(v1,v2)=1. It further holds that all the
symbols in the side information x|NH(v1,v2)of the vertex (v1,v2)are zeros. By the deﬁnition of hv2,
it follows that hv2(y) =1, as required.
We obtain that every two adjacent vertices v1and v2inGsatisfy hv1/\e}atio\slash=hv2. Since the number
of functions hv:Σk→ { 0, 1}forv∈VGdoes not exceed 2|Σ|k, it follows that χ(G)≤2|Σ|k, and we
are done.
4 Hardness Results
In this section, we prove our hardness results for the promis e problems associated with orthogo-
nality dimension and minrank, which imply hardness of appro ximation for these quantities. We
also suggest a potential avenue for proving hardness result s for the general index coding problem
over a constant-size alphabet.
The starting point of our hardness proofs is the following th eorem of Wrochna and ˇZivn ´y [40].
Recall that the function b:N→Nis deﬁned by b(n) =(n
⌊n/2⌋).
Theorem 4.1 ([40]) .For every integer k ≥4, it isNP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes
χ(G)≤k orχ(G)≥b(k).
Our hardness results for the orthogonality dimension and th e minrank parameter over ﬁnite
ﬁelds are given by the following theorem, which conﬁrms Theore m 1.2.
16Theorem 4.2. There exists a function f :N→Nsatisfying f (k) = ( 1−o(1))·/radicalbig
b(k)such that for
every ﬁnite ﬁeld Fand for every sufﬁciently large integer k, the following holds .
1. It isNP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes
ξF(G)≤k or ξF(G)≥1√
log|F|·f(k).
2. It isNP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes
minrk F(G)≤k or minrk F(G)≥1√
2·log|F|·f(k).
Proof: Fix a ﬁnite ﬁeld F. We start by proving the ﬁrst item of the theorem. For an intege rk≥4,
consider the problem of deciding whether a given graph Gsatisﬁes
χ(G)≤b(k)orχ(G)≥b(b(k)),
whoseNP-hardness follows from Theorem 4.1. To obtain our hardness r esult on the orthogonality
dimension over F, we reduce from this problem. Consider the reduction that gi ven an input graph
Gproduces and outputs the underlying graph Hof the digraph δG. This reduction can clearly be
implemented in polynomial time (in fact, in logarithmic spa ce).
To prove the correctness of the reduction, we analyze the ort hogonality dimension of Hover
F. IfGis aYES instance, that is, χ(G)≤b(k), then by combining Claim 2.8 with Theorem 3.2, it
follows that
ξF(H)≤χ(H)≤k.
IfGis aNOinstance, that is, χ(G)≥b(b(k)), then by Theorem 3.5, it follows that
ξF(H)≥/radicalBig
log|F|χ(G)≥/radicalBig
log|F|b(b(k)) =1−o(1)√
log|F|·/radicalBig
b(k),
where the o(1)term tends to 0 when ktends to inﬁnity. Note that we have used here the fact that
b(n) = Θ(2n/√n). By letting kbe any sufﬁciently large integer, the proof of the ﬁrst item of t he
theorem is completed.
The proof of the second item of the theorem is similar. To avoi d repetitions, we brieﬂy mention
the needed changes in the proof. First, to obtain a hardness r esult for the minrank parameter, the
reduction has to output the complement Hof the graph Hrather than Hitself. Second, in the
analysis of the NOinstances, one has to apply Theorem 3.13 instead of Theorem 3 .5 to obtain that
minrk F(H)≥/radicalBig
1
2·log|F|χ(G)≥/radicalBig
1
2·log|F|b(b(k)) =1−o(1)√
2·log|F|·/radicalBig
b(k).
This completes the proof of the theorem.
As an immediate corollary of Theorem 4.2, we obtain the follo wing.
Corollary 4.3. For every ﬁnite ﬁeld F, the following holds.
1. It isNP-hard to approximate ξF(G)for a given graph G to within any constant factor.
172. It isNP-hard to approximate minrk F(G)for a given graph G to within any constant factor.
We next prove a hardness result for the orthogonality dimens ion over the reals, conﬁrming
Theorem 1.1.
Theorem 4.4. There exists a function f :N→Nsatisfying f (k) = Θ(/radicalbig
b(k)/k)such that for every
sufﬁciently large integer k, it is NP-hard to decide whether a given graph G satisﬁes
ξR(G)≤k or ξR(G)≥f(k).
Proof: As in the proof of Theorem 4.2, for an integer k≥4, we reduce from the problem of
deciding whether a given graph Gsatisﬁes
χ(G)≤b(k)orχ(G)≥b(b(k)),
whoseNP-hardness follows from Theorem 4.1. Consider the polynomia l-time reduction that given
an input graph Gproduces and outputs the underlying graph Hof the digraph δG.
To prove the correctness of the reduction, we analyze the ort hogonality dimension of Hover
R. IfGis aYES instance, that is, χ(G)≤b(k), then by combining Claim 2.8 with Theorem 3.2, it
follows that
ξR(H)≤χ(H)≤k.
IfGis aNOinstance, that is, χ(G)≥b(b(k)), then by Theorem 3.7 combined with the fact that
b(n) =Θ(2n/√n), it follows that
ξR(H)≥c·/radicalbigg
logb(b(k))
log log b(b(k))=Θ/parenleftBig/radicalBig
b(k)
k/parenrightBig
,
where cis an absolute positive constant. This completes the proof o f the theorem.
As an immediate corollary of Theorem 4.4, we obtain the follo wing.
Corollary 4.5. It isNP-hard to approximate ξR(G)for a given graph G to within any constant factor.
We end this section with a statement that might be useful for p rovingNP-hardness results for
the general index coding problem. Consider the following de ﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.6. For an alphabet Σand for two integers k 1<k2, letIndex -CodingΣ(k1,k2)denote the
problem of deciding whether the minimal length of an index code for a given graph G over Σis at most k 1
or at least k 2.
We prove the following result.
Theorem 4.7. LetΣbe an alphabet of size at least 2, and let k 1,k2be two integers. Then, there exists a
polynomial-time reduction from the problem of deciding wheth er a given graph G satisﬁes χ(G)≤b(k1)
orχ(G)≥k2toIndex -CodingΣ(k1, log|Σ|logk2).
18Proof: Consider the polynomial-time reduction that given an input graph Gproduces the under-
lying graph Hof the digraph δGand outputs its complement H. For correctness, suppose ﬁrst
that Gis aYES instance, that is, χ(G)≤b(k1). Then, by combining Claim 2.8 with Theorem 3.2,
it follows that minrk F2(H)≤χ(H)≤k1. By Proposition 2.10, it further follows that there exists a
linear index code for Hover F2of length k1. In particular, using |Σ| ≥2, there exists an index code
forHover the alphabet Σof length k1. Suppose next that Gis aNOinstance, that is, χ(G)≥k2.
By Theorem 3.17, it follows that the length of any index code f orHover Σis at least log|Σ|logk2,
so we are done.
Theorem 4.7 implies that in order to prove the NP-hardness of the general index coding prob-
lem over some ﬁnite alphabet Σof size at least 2, it sufﬁces to prove for some integer kthat it is
NP-hard to decide whether a given graph Gsatisﬁes χ(G)≤b(k)orχ(G)>2|Σ|k.
