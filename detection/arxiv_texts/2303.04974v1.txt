We investigate the nonequilibrium photocarrier dynamics of WTe 2under pressure using the optical
pump-probe spectroscopy. The pressure dependences of the electronic relaxation manifest anomalous
changes around 0.8, 3.5, and 6 GPa, indicating the abruptions in the electron-phonon interactions.
In addition, the coherent phonon oscillations originating from shear mode suddenly disappears above
3.5 GPa, which marks the onset of Td-1T’ structural phase transition. Supported by the theoretical
calculation, we unveil the electronic topological transitions (ETTs), especially an emergence of a
new type-II Weyl point for Td-WTe 2under pressure. Our work demonstrates a novel route to probe
the ETTs under pressure.
Dirac and Weyl semimetals possess linear energy dis-
persions and massless fermions, as well as the a high
mobility, ultralow scattering rate,[1–3] and thus are in-
structive in understanding basic concepts in high-energy
physics.[4] The Dirac points commonly appear in highly
symmetrical materials, however, are able to evolve into
two Weyl points with opposite chirality once the inver-
sion symmetry or time-reversal symmetry is broken.[5]
Moreover, the Dirac and Weyl semimetals can be divided
into two types (types I and II), depending on the tilting
of the band structure around the neutral point.[5] Weyl
semimetals with band-touching points can host extraor-
dinary physical phenomena, such as negative magnetore-
sistance and topological Fermi arcs.[6–8] These afore-
mentioned versatile properties make the Weyl semimetals
attractive both in the fundamental research and device
applications.[3, 9–11] Pressure provides a clean route to
continuously tune the interactions between atoms, which
can give rise to the modiﬁcation of the electronic struc-
ture without concomitant lattice abruptions, featuring
electronic topological transitions (ETT) or emergence
of new Dirac/Weyl points in materials.[12–14] Gener-
ally, highly symmetrical Dirac/Weyl points can be di-
rectly identiﬁed using angular resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy (ARPES) by mapping the electronic energy
bands. ARPES, however, cannot be implemented under
extreme conditions, such as high pressure. Other experi-
mental techniques, such as the Shubnikov-de Haas eﬀect,
electrical resistance, and Raman/infrared spectroscopy,
also are used to probe the emerging Dirac/Weyl points
under pressure.[14–17] These measurements are sensitive
to the electron structures around band extremes or theFermi level, which are always subjected to the defect
states and disturbances from the neighboring electron
or/and hole pockets, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Hence, new
diagnostic methods accessing the information of electrons
away from the Fermi level or extreme points of energy
bands are highly desirable to understand the ETTs un-
der pressure.
For materials systems, including semiconductors and
semimetals, the ultrafast photoexcitation using femtosec-
ond (fs) or ps laser pulse is able to establish a transient
nonequilibrium electronic state, where the photocarri-
ers are distributed over the large k space (Fig. 1 (a)).
The subsequent relaxation dynamics strongly depends
on the details of the electronic structures.[18, 19] Such
photo-induced electronic redistribution normally results
in a higher temperature (T e) than lattice (T l), which
can launch the electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions with
the participation of not only the low-frequency acoustic
phonons but also the high-frequency optical phonons.[19]
The ultrafast spectroscopy can be used to track the time
evolution of the intraband and interband electronic tran-
sitions, which allows us to access the energy band dis-
persion at high-k region and disentangles the complex in-
teractions among diﬀerent quasiparticles,[18–20] beyond
what is attainable with conventional steady-state op-
tics or transport measurements. Therefore, the ultrafast
spectroscopy in combination with a diamond anvil cell
(DAC), applied to the studies of nonequilibrium quasi-
particles and electrons cooling for strongly correlated sys-
tems and low-dimensional materials,[21, 22] may open a
new avenue to decipher the ETTs and/or the emerging
Dirac/Weyl points under pressure. In recent years, di-arXiv:2303.04974v1  [cond-mat.str-el]  9 Mar 20232
verse ultrafast spectroscopies have been employed to in-
vestigate the topological semiconductors or semimetals
under ambient conditions, but only rarely have been ex-
tended to high-pressure conditions.[22] WTe 2, as a repre-
sentative type-II Weyl semimetal,[23, 24] adopts the or-
thorhombic Td phase with distorted triangular lattices of
tungsten and tellurium atoms, showing strong anisotropy
at ambient condition.[25–33] With applying the external
pressure, the Td phase is suppressed and gradually trans-
formed to the monoclinic 1T’ structure phase, which is
accompanied by the emergence of the superconductivity
and the elimination of the topological Weyl fermions due
to the introduction of the inversion center.[25, 26, 34–37]
In addition, a Lifshitz transition also occurs at around
3 GPa, introducing a series of exotic phenomena, such
as the drastic weakening of the extremely large magne-
toresistance, the pronounced changes of the optical con-
ductivity spectrum, etc.[35, 38, 39] Therefore, WTe 2can
serve as an ideal prototypical testbed for the investiga-
tions of pressure-induced ETT.
In this work, we employed the fs optical pump-probe
spectroscopy (OPPS) combined with the DAC technique
to investigate the photocarrier dynamics of WTe 2under
hydrostatic pressure up to 21.3 GPa. We ﬁnd that the
coherent phonon (CP) excitation arising from the inter-
layer shear vibration is suddenly suppressed above 3.5
GPa. Moreover, the fast time constant ( τfast) shows the
discontinuity at approximately 0.8, 3.5, and 6 GPa, re-
spectively. By combining the theoretical analysis, we re-
veal the ETTs under pressure, especially the emergence
of the new type-II Weyl points around the Fermi level
above 3.5 GPa.
For the experiment, the high-quality WTe 2single crys-
tals were grown through self-ﬂux method.[40–42] In ad-
dition, we repeated the measurements using other sam-
ples, including the WTe 2crystals purchased from the Six-
Carbon Technology and HQ Graphene, and obtained the
same results. The hydrostatic pressure condition was ob-
tained using a DAC with the culet of 300 µm, in which we
applied silicon oil as the pressure-transmitting medium.
All of the samples were exfoliated mechanically to obtain
a fresh and ﬂat surface before loading into the sample
chamber. The pressures were gauged by the photolumi-
nescence of the ruby balls. To access the photocarrier
dynamics of WTe 2under pressure, we conducted the fs-
OPPS with reﬂectivity geometry in combination with the
DAC. Brieﬂy, the fs pulses with 1.55 eV photon energies,
delivered from an fs oscillator, were used as the pump
and probe sources for the fs-OPPS. The pump and probe
beams were created using a beamsplitter and a control-
lable time delay was introduced for the probe beam. As
shown in Fig. 1(b), the pump and probe beams were
spatially separated; they were focused on the sample in-
side the DAC using an objective lens with spot diameters
of 10 and 4 µm, respectively. In the measurements, the
orthogonal polarizations of the pump and probe beamswere maintained to eﬃciently suppress the background
scattering signal. We rotated the DAC with the sample
along the DAC axis to examine the angular dependencies
of the signal.
Pressure dependences of photocarrier dynamics
The diﬀerential reﬂectivity (DR) transients, ∆R/R 0,
(∆R=R-R 0) as a function of pump-probe delay under
selected pressures are presented in Fig. 1(c), where the
R or R 0is the reﬂectivity with and without the pump,
respectively. More pressure-dependent data are provided
in Fig. S4 in the Supplemental Material. In the measure-
ment [Fig. 1(c)], the polarization of the probe light was
set as parallel in either an a direction (upper panel) or
b direction (lower panel). We determined the crystalline
orientation of the Td-WTe 2crystal based on the angle-
resolved Raman spectroscopy and fs-OPPS (see Figs. S1
and S3 in the Supplemental Material). Hereafter, these
two probe-polarization geometries are referred to as par-
allel and perpendicular conﬁgurations. At ambient con-
ditions, the DR signal features an initial instantaneous
dropping, which is followed by a relaxation process com-
posed with a fast rising and a subsequent slow decay su-
perimposed with periodic oscillations. The periodic oscil-
lation stems from the excitation of the CP corresponding
to the A 1optical phonon mode, with a frequency of 0.25
THz.[43, 44] The incoherent electronic response contains
the fast and slow relaxation stages; the fast component is
attributed to the energy dissipation of the photocarrier
through optical phonon scattering, while the slow com-
ponent should be governed by the interactions between
the electrons and acoustic phonons[19] or the phonon-
assisted e-h recombination between the electron and hole
pockets,[45] exhibiting a long-lived oﬀset within our time-
scanning range.
As revealed by Figs. 1(c) and S4, the photocarrier
dynamics in WTe 2shows obvious in-plane anisotropy
due to the directional one-dimensional tungsten-chain
structure, which is akin to the observations in black
phosphorous.[46] Clearly, the DR transients strongly de-
pend on the external pressure. In addition, the two com-
mon pressure eﬀects for both parallel and perpendicu-
lar polarization conﬁgurations can be directly identiﬁed
from the Figs. 1(c) and S4. First, in both polarization
conﬁgurations, the amplitude of the fast component with
negative sign in the incoherent DR signal pronouncedly
declines upon compressing, and almost disappears as the
pressure is beyond 6 GPa. Instead, with further elevating
pressure, the fast relaxation component over subpicosec-
ond timescale resurge in the manner of rapid rising with
positive sign above 15.5 GPa. Second, the CP oscilla-
tions suddenly vanish as the pressure is beyond 3.5 GPa.

XRD experiments have corroborated that the adjacent3

Te-W-Te layers undergo an opposite sliding, leading to
a structural transition from the orthorhombic Td-WTe 2
to monoclinic 1T’-WTe 2.[25, 26, 34] However, no consen-
sus was reached as for the turning pressure of the Td-
1T’ phase transition pressure. The reported transition
points are scattered in the pressure ranges from 4.5 to
9.6 GPa.[25, 26, 34, 37, 39] The suppression of the CP
excitation of the shear mode was proposed to serve as
an indicator for Td-1T’ phase transition in MoTe 2,[47]
although it was not accessed yet under high pressure.
Therefore, we suggest that the disappearance of the CP
oscillations at 3.5 GPa marks the onset of the Td-1T’
transition.
To gain the quantitative insights into the pressure de-
pendence of the photocarrier dynamics, we ﬁt the DR
curve in terms of a damped harmonic oscillator func-
tion combined with a single-exponential function for each
pressure, as follows:
∆R
R0=Afexp(−t
τf) +ACPexp(−t
τCP)cos(2πft+ϕ) +B
(1)
where A CPis the CP amplitude, τCPis the lifetime of
CP, f is the CP frequency, and ϕis the initial phase of
CP oscillations. A fandτfdenote the amplitude and
time constant of the fast decay component, respectively.
According to the two-temperature model,[43, 48] the e-
ph coupling constant, λ, is roughly proportional to the
energy relaxation rate 1/ τf. Thereby, ﬁrst of all, we pay
special attention to the τfto assess the pressure evolu-
tion of the e-ph interactions. The extracted time constantfor the fast decay process ( τf), for parallel and perpendic-
ular conﬁgurations, versus pressure is presented in Fig.
1(d). As the probe light is along the a direction, the τf
monotonously decreases with increasing pressure, while
shows an abrupt discontinuous change of approximately
37% in magnitude around 3.5 GPa. With further com-
pression, the τfagain reduces with pressure up to 6 GPa,
followed by a gradual rising at higher pressures. Inter-
estingly, the pressure dependence of τfobtained in the
perpendicular conﬁguration exhibits a diﬀerent pressure
behavior. The τfessentially remains constant below 3.5
GPa, with an exception of a recognizable sudden drop at
around 0.8 GPa. An abrupt rising of the τfaround 3.5
GPa is also discernible although the value is far smaller
than that in the parallel conﬁguration. Under higher
pressure, the time constant pronouncedly increases up to
6 GPa, and subsequently dramatically shortens.
Overall, we clearly distinguished the three discontinu-
ities around 0.8, 3.5, and 6 GPa for the pressure depen-
dence ofτf, emphasizing the pressure-induced abrup-
tions in the e-ph interactions. To further reveal if there
are additional lattice structure changes except the Td-
1T’ phase transition, we carried out the high-pressure
Raman scattering measurement with short pressure step.
As exempliﬁed in Fig. S2 in the Supplemental Material,
the pressure behaviors of Raman modes do not manifest
any discontinuity but a subtle uptrend on the slop of
the frequency at around 3.5 GPa in our studied pressure
range, which is in line with earlier reports.[25, 26, 34] In
addition, we can see that the CP experiences an initial4
increase in the amplitude before it completely disappears
as shown in Fig. S4. The totally suppression of the CP
signal occurs in a sharp pressure range as 0.5 GPa, which
is in striking contrast with the reported gradual evolu-
tion from Td to 1T’ phase.[25, 26, 37] Thus, we infer
that the abrupt changes in electronic structure, such as
the Lifshitz transition should be taken into account to
explain the anomalies of the pressure dependences of the
photocarrier dynamics.
DFT calculations for electronic structures of WTe 2
under pressure
To unveil the pressure eﬀects of the electronic struc-
tures for Td-WTe 2, we performed the DFT calculations,
(see the details in the Supplemental Material). The cal-
culated energy bands under pressure are shown in Fig.
2(a). Accordingly, the cross sections of the Fermi sur-
face around the Fermi level at 0, 2.5, and 4 GPa were
extracted, shown in Fig. 2(b). One can ﬁnd that there
exist sharp changes around Fermi level (-0.1 eV ∼0.1 eV)
along Γ-Y with increasing pressure. At the pressure of
0 GPa, the type-II Weyl points, derived from the tiny
band crossing above the Fermi level at around 0.05 eV,
can be recognized, which is consistent with a previous
report.[24] As the pressure increases up to about 2.5 GPa,
both the electron and hole pockets gradually grow in size
along with increasing pressure, and eventually the two
electron pockets merge into one, as shown in Fig. 2(b).
Such a topological change of the Fermi surface has been
observed by the magneto-transport methods,[38] demon-
strating a Lifshitz transition. The growth of the pocket
volumes implies an augment of the density of electronic
states at k-space around the energy-band extreme points,
which can eﬀectively render more available phase space
at low-energy range for hot carrier distribution and thus
shorten the fast decay time constant.[21, 22] Remarkably,
the electronic density of states (DOS) along the Γ-X di-
rection in k-space (along the b-axis in real space) surges
due to the merging of the electron pockets, and thus can
lead to a sudden drop of the τfas the probe polariza-
tion is along the b-axis. Note that the τfis not sensitive
to the adjustment of the pump polarization, as shown in
Fig S3(a) in the Supplemental Material. This observa-
tion seems plausible because the initial orientating mo-
menta of the photocarriers, endowed by the polarized
pump photon upon photoexcitation, would be rapidly
randomized over a few tens of femtoseconds (shorter than
the pulse duration of the fs laser used in our experiment)
through carrier-carrier scatterings.[49]
Further increasing the pressure up to 4 GPa, our cal-
culations reveal that a new Weyl point with linear band
dispersion emerges at around the Fermi level, accompa-
nying with a gap closing. At further compression, this
new Weyl point vanishes, and a gap reopens but theFermi surface topology retains when the pressure signiﬁ-
cantly increases up to about 6 GPa. This new Weyl point
is quite diﬀerent from that at low pressure (0 ∼1 GPa).
The initial eight Weyl points originate from the double
degeneracies due to the spin-orbit coupling,[24] while the
high-pressure Weyl points result from the point contact
between the conduction and valence bands modulated by
the external pressure. This result implies possibly dis-
tinct transport or ultrafast dynamical behaviors at dif-
ferent pressures. Since the e-ph interaction for the elec-
tronic band with a linear energy dispersion is commonly
expected to be weakened due to the large Fermi velocity
and small eﬀective mass,[50] we propose that the forma-
tion of Weyl point can facilitate the decoupling between
electron and phonon, resulting in the sudden increase of
τfaround 3.5 GPa. The anisotropy of the new-born Weyl
points in k-space should be responsible for the polariza-
tion sensitivity of the τf. Especially, the τfexhibits a
reversed pressure behavior above 3.5 GPa for parallel and
perpendicular conﬁgurations (Fig. 2(d)). Such an eﬀect
is consistent with the shift of the new Weyl points from
the highly symmetrical Γ-Y direction (a-axis) to the Γ-
X direction (b-axis) as unveiled by the calculation. We
should mention that our calculations do not reveal sud-
den change in the electronic structure around 6 GPa for
WTe 2with Td phase, and cannot account for the turn-
ing point of 6 GPa of the pressure dependence of the
τf. We propose that there are two possible mechanisms
underlying the anomaly. (1) The gradual Td-1T’ phase
transition may lead to the hybrid phases with Td and
1T’ structural WTe 2in the 4-6 GPa pressure range. This
anomaly in photocarrier dynamics can be trigged when
the 1T’ phase dominates with pressure. (2) Additional
ETT likely takes place for 1T’ phase at around 6 GPa,
resulting in the abruption of e-ph interaction. Overall,
the anomalous transitions of τfwith pressure should be
correlated with the electronic structure transition, the
ﬁrst anomaly around 0.8 GPa is associated with the Lif-
shitz transition of the electronic bands, and the sudden
changes above 3.5 GPa has a close correspondence with
the emergence of the new Weyl point at the Fermi level.
Pressure dependence of the coherent phonon
The pressure induced change in the electronic structure
not only modiﬁes the electronic response of the DR sig-
nal but also impacts the CP excitation. In Fig. 3(a),
we plot the CP time-domain intensity proﬁles at dif-
ferent pressures as the color map, where the incoher-
ent electronic background under diﬀerent pressures was
subtracted. Accordingly, the dynamical parameters in-
cluding the frequency (f CP), lifetime ( τCP), amplitude
(ACP), and phase ( ϕ) versus the pressures are illustrated
in the Figs. 3(b)-(e). Apparently, the CP frequency
manifests blueshift with pressure, which is due to the5

pressure-induced enhancement of interlayer interactions.
Moreover, we can see that the lifetime of CP shortens
with increasing pressure, emphasizing the reinforcement
of anharmonic interactions between phonons.[51] Such in-
crease in an anharmonic coupling cannot fully account for
the sudden vanishing of the CP oscillation above 3.5 GPa
since theτCPshould not be zero albeit it reduces by a
factor of 5. Indeed, the lifetime of CP is expected to be
about 40 ps at 3.5 GPa according to the trend. In ad-
dition, the CP amplitude exhibits a prominent increase
before it completely disappears as shown in Fig. 3(d).
The sudden changes of the lifetime and amplitude of the
CP with pressures further emphasize that the topologi-cal transition of the electronic structures plays nontrivial
roles for the e-ph coupling.
As shown in Fig. 3(e), the phase ϕat ambient pressure
is∼0, indicating a cosine-type CP oscillation, which high-
lights that the coherent shear phonon stems from the dis-
placive excitation.[52, 53] The displacive CP excitation
is associated with the shift of the potential energy sur-
face induced by the nonradiative energy delivery through
the e-ph coupling.[54] Thereby, we suggest that the sud-
den changes of CP oscillation around 3.5 GPa reﬂect an
abrupt reduction in the e-ph coupling. It can be seen that
the phase shift rapidly increases with elevating pressure
and amounts to -45◦around 3.5 GPa. In other word, the6
lattice response shows an extra delay in response to the
photoexcitation under pressure. As for the displacive CP,
if the lifetime of CP is far smaller than that of electronic
relaxation, the phase is roughly linked with the frequency
and CP lifetime, that is, ϕ≈arctan(-1/(f τCP)).[55] Ac-
cordingly, the maximum change in the phase is estimated
about 3.2◦under pressure, which is much less than the
experimental result. Previous work has revealed that the
electron temperature and the carrier cooling during the
nascent stage of electronic relaxation strongly impact the
coordinate position of the potential energy surface of the
excited state and can give rise to the large phase shift of
CP in TiO 2.[56] Along this line, we suggest that an ex-
traordinary large phase shift has a close correlation with
the changes in the electronic structure. As shown by
the above calculation (Fig. 2), both the DOS and the
size of the Fermi pockets increase remarkably with pres-
sure, allowing for more state occupations at the lower
energy side. As a result, the initial carrier temperature
upon photoexcitation is expected to be decreased along
with the ETT under pressure. Such attenuation in elec-
tron temperature may lead to a non-instantaneous driv-
ing force for CP excitation.[56] Furthermore, we propose
that the reduction both in the electron temperature and
e-ph coupling due to the ETT and the formation of the
Weyl point above 4 GPa decrease the energy exchange
rate between electron and lattice, and further suppress
the excitation of CP.
In summary, we employ the fs-OPPS in combina-
tion with DAC to investigate the pressure evolutions of
nonequilibrium photocarrier dynamics in WTe 2, reﬂect-
ing the details of the electronic structure over large k-
space previously inaccessible under pressure. We ﬁnd
that the DR curves comprised with incoherent electronic
response and CP manifest the anomalies around 0.8, 3.5,
and 6 GPa, depending on the light polarization. With
increasing pressure, the CP stemming from the A 1mode
starts to disappear above 3.5 GPa. Concomitantly, the
fast time constant of the electronic relaxation shows a
recognizable sudden drop around 0.8 GPa, and also a
remarkable jump at around 3.5 GPa. Such pressure be-
haviors of photocarrier dynamics signify the electronic
structure transitions in the crystal structure. The ﬁrst-
principles calculation reveals a topology change of Fermi
surface and a new type-II Weyl energy dispersion below
6 GPa. Our work does not only develop the better un-
derstandings of the e-ph interactions in WTe 2, but also
proposes a new technique to probe the electronic topo-
logical changes under pressure.

OPTICAL ANISOTROPY DETERMINED VIA RAMAN SCATTERING
For the Raman scattering measurements, a 660-nm sapphire laser was applied with the average power less than 2
mW measured before a ×20 objective lens. A single-stage spectrograph with a CCD detector (Princeton Instruments)
was employed using an 1800 g/mm grating to collect the signal in the backscattering geometry.

respect to rotation angle for the Raman mode at around 80 cm−1. The a and b axes of the crystal lattice (dashed lines) were
deduced based on these data.
The ambient orthorhombic Td phase of the WTe 2belongs to the C7
2vspace group symmetry, the Raman active
modes are 11A 1+ 6A 2.[1, 2] Here, we measure the Raman spectra of the WTe 2at diﬀerent polarization directions
in the ab plane to examine the anisotropy, results are shown in Fig. S1(a). Only 11 Raman modes can be observed
from the spectra and each of them has been marked.[1] Intensy of the mode at around 80 cm−1is extracted by ﬁtting
with Lorentz function and plotted in Fig. S1(b) with the rotation angles. Indeed, this mode shows typical twofold
symmetry, which is in accordance with the previous work.[1] The a and b axes of the host-crystal lattice can also
be determined and indicated by dashed lines, here a axis is along the zig-zag tungsten chain and b axis is in the
perpendicular direction, details are also painted in Fig. 1(b).arXiv:2303.04974v1  [cond-mat.str-el]  9 Mar 20232

FIG. S2. (a) Raman spectra of WTe 2with the laser polarization along the a and b axes of the sample at high pressures. The
spectra have been displaced vertically for clarity. (b) Pressure dependence of the frequency of the10A1mode obtained by the
experiment (solid black lines) and theoretical calculation (solid red line).
In order to investigate the vibrational properties of the WTe 2at high pressures, we measure the Raman spectra
with the polarization of the incident light along the a and b axes and the pressure ranging from 0 to 21.8 GPa.
The spectra, as well as the frequency of the10A1peak ﬁtted by a Lorentz function, at diﬀerent pressures and beam
polarizations are shown in Fig. S2. The spectra along these two directions almost share the same behaviors with
pressure. No obvious sudden changes in Raman shifts are observed below 20 GPa. However, the slope of the pressure
dependence of the10A1mode shows the subtle changes around 3.5, 7, and 15.5 GPa.
ANISOTROPIC ULTRAFAST DYNAMICS OF THE WTE 2
Transient diﬀerential reﬂectivity ∆R/R 0of WTe 2at diﬀerent polarization of the incident pump and probe beams
is presented in Figs. S3(a) and (b). The transient reﬂectivity falls suddenly within less than 1 ps due to the rapid
increase of the hot carriers stimulated by the intense fs pump pulse. Subsequently, it starts to recover to the initial
state because of the excess energy release of the unstable hot carriers to the phonon. Coherent oscillations, which
superpose on the relaxation curves, can also be detected, and are demonstrated to stem from the lowest energy A 1
optical mode.[3, 4] As can be seen from Fig. S3(a), the amplitude of the oscillation frequency is almost constant
with changing the polarization of the incident pump beam, indicating that the decay processes of the hot carriers
are insensitive to the pump polarization. However, the amplitude of the oscillation ﬂuctuates with changing the
polarization of the incident probe laser and even disappears at certain directions. We extract the signal value at the
ﬁrst wave peaks/valleys and plot a radar chart with respect to rotation angle in the inset of Fig. S3. Similar with
our Raman data shown in Fig. S1, WTe 2shows a typical twofold symmetry, suggests a strong anisotropy exists on
the electron and phonon structures of the Td-WTe 2. The crystallographic axes are also labeled in the inset of Fig.
S3 with considering the Raman results.3

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
Our ﬁrst-principle calculations are performed based on density functional theory (DFT) using Perdew-Burke-
Ernzerhof (PBE) functional[5] as the exchange correlation functionals and projector augmented wave (PAW)[6] as
pseudopotentials within generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as implemented in Vienna ab initio Simulation
package (VASP)[7]. The lattice parameters under pressure are obtained through the structural relaxation with the
van der Waals (vdW) correction of optB88-vdW.[8, 9] For high accuracy results, a large plane-wave energy cutoﬀ of
500 eV and a dense Monkhorst-Pack[10] k-point mesh are used. The total energy and ionic force convergence criteria
are set to 10−6eV and 10−3eV/˚A, respectively. All of the calculations are cross-checked by using both the VASP[7]
and WIEN2K[11] codes.
