Towhichdegreetheaverageentanglemententropyofmidspectrumeigenstatesofquantum-chaotic
interacting Hamiltonians agrees with that of random pure states is a question that has attracted
considerable attention in the recent years. While there is substantial evidence that the leading
(volume-law) terms are identical, which and how subleading terms differ between them is less clear.
Here we carry out state-of-the-art full exact diagonalization calculations of clean spin-1/2 XYZ and
XXZ chains with integrability breaking terms to address this question in the absence and presence
ofU(1)symmetry, respectively. We first introduce the notion of maximally chaotic regime, for
the chain sizes amenable to full exact diagonalization calculations, as the regime in Hamiltonian
parameters in which the level spacing ratio, the distribution of eigenstate coefficients, and the
entanglement entropy are closest to the random matrix theory predictions. In this regime, we carry
out a finite-size scaling analysis of the subleading terms of the average entanglement entropy of
midspectrum eigenstates when different fractions νof the spectrum are included in the average.
We find indications that, for ν→0, the magnitude of the negative O(1)correction is only slightly
greater than the one predicted for random pure states. For finite ν, following a phenomenological
approach, we derive a simple expression that describes the numerically observed νdependence of
theO(1)deviation from the prediction for random pure states.
I. INTRODUCTION
Entanglement is one of the most fundamental and in-
triguing features of quantum mechanics [1, 2]. Since the
early 2000s, we have learned that in physical Hamilto-
nians there are qualitative differences between entangle-
ment in ground states, which typically exhibit an “area-
law” entanglement entropy [3], and in highly excited
energy eigenstates, which typically exhibit a “volume-
law” entanglement entropy [4]. Entanglement has also
been conjectured to serve as a diagnostic for quantum
chaos and integrability [5]. Using full exact diagonal-
ization calculations, the average bipartite entanglement
entropies of highly excited eigenstates of spin-1/2 XXZ
chains were shown to behave qualitatively differently at
and away from integrability [5]. Specifically, while the
average in both regimes exhibits a leading volume-law
term, the coefficient of the volume in that term was
found to be maximal for midspectrum eigenstates in the
quantum-chaotic regime (consistent with findings in ear-
lier works [6, 7]; see also Refs. [8–10]) and lower than
maximalandsubsystem-fractiondependentatintegrabil-
ity (as found for quadratic models and integrable models
mappable onto quadratic ones [11–18]).
Following on the previously mentioned studies, our fo-
cus in this work is the entanglement entropy of highly
excited eigenstates of clean spin-1/2 quantum-chaotic in-
teracting Hamiltonians. We consider chains with Lsites
(we change Lto carry out scaling analyses) with peri-
odic and open boundary conditions. For pure quantum
states |ψ⟩, which we will take to be Hamiltonian eigen-states, we study the (bipartite) entanglement entropy of
a subsystem A(with LAcontiguous sites) after tracing
out the complement B(with LB=L−LAcontiguous
sites), resulting in
ˆρA= Tr B|ψ⟩⟨ψ|. (1)
The von Neumann entanglement entropy (in short, the
entanglement entropy) of subsystem Ais
SA=−Tr(ˆρAln ˆρA). (2)
The entanglement entropy of random pure states with
the same Hilbert space in a lattice with Lsites (whose
spacial configuration is irrelevant) is a natural counter-
part to compare to the entanglement entropy of eigen-
states of quantum-chaotic interacting Hamiltonians [4].
By now, there is strong evidence that the leading term
in the average entanglement entropy is the same for mid-
spectrum eigenstates and for random pure states [4]. An
important question is then to which degree the average
entanglement entropy of those midspectrum eigenstates
agrees, beyond the leading volume-law term, with the
average over random pure states.
For spin-1/2 chains with U(1)symmetry (particle-
number conservation in the spinless fermions language)
this question was explored by two of us (L.V. and M.R.)
in Ref. [6]. Away from the zero magnetization sector
(“half-filling” for fermions) the main finding was that,
when one traces out 1/2 of the lattice sites, the aver-
age entanglement entropy of random pure states exhibits
a first subleading term that scales with the square rootarXiv:2303.13577v3  [cond-mat.stat-mech]  31 Aug 20232
of the number of sites in the lattice. The numerical cal-
culations then indicated that, remarkably, the average
entanglement entropy of the midspectrum eigenstates of
thequantum-chaoticspin-1/2chainexhibitthesamesub-
leadingterm. Atzeromagnetization, whenonetracesout
1/2 of the lattice sites, the first subleading term in the
average entanglement entropy of random pure states is
O(1)[4]. The numerical calculations in Ref. [6] indicated
that the same is true about the average entanglement en-
tropy of the midspectrum eigenstates, with a value of the
constant that is close to that for random pure states.
Theleadingtermsoftheaverageentanglemententropy
of random pure states with fixed total magnetization Sz,
magnetization per site sz=Sz/L, or, equivalently, at
spinless fermions filling n=sz+ 1/2, were fully derived
in Ref. [4] using methods introduced in Ref. [19]:

where LA≤L
2, and o(1)is used for terms that vanish in
the thermodynamic limit. In Eq. (3), f=LA/Lstands
for the “subsystem fraction.” To obtain the results for
LA>L
2(f >1
2), one just needs to replace LA→L−LA
in Eq. (3).
It is important to remark that because of the U(1)
symmetry, in Eq. (3) there is an O(1)“mean-field” cor-
rection to the average entanglement entropy of random
pure states at all values of the magnetization and sub-
system fractions, which was derived in Ref. [6],
S(1)
MF=f+ ln(1 −f)

The fact that this is the only O(1)correction to the lead-
ing volume-law term away from f= 1/2was proved later
in Ref. [4]. At f= 1/2, and onlyat zero magnetization,
the additional −1/2correction is the same as that found
by Page in the absence of U(1)symmetry [20]. In the lat-
ter case, the average entanglement entropy over random
states reads

Recent works have attempted to identify the reasons
behind, andquantifythedifferences, betweentheaverage
entanglement entropy over random pure states and over
Hamiltonian eigenstates in the absence of U(1)symme-
try [21–24]. In Ref. [21], Huang conjectured (and pro-
vided some numerical evidence) that the average entan-
glement entropy over all eigenstates of local quantum-
chaotic interacting Hamiltonians has the form
¯SA=LAln 2 +ln(1−f)

ity and locality of the Hamiltonian. The result in Eq. (6)
coincides with the one obtained in Ref. [4] for the aver-
age entanglement entropy of random pure states in the
presence of U(1)symmetry when all (properly weighted)
magnetization sectors are included in the average.
Following on Ref. [21], and on numerical results re-
ported in Ref. [22], Huang conjectured (and provided
some numerical evidence) that the average entangle-
ment entropy over midspectrum eigenstates of (local)
quantum-chaotic interacting Hamiltonians at f= 1/2
has the form [23]

while for ν= 0+one obtains

4, (8)
which coincides with the result in Eq. (3) at f= 1/2
andn= 1/2, i.e., Eq. (8) is identical to the result for the
averageoverrandompurestateswithfixedmagnetization
sz= 0atf= 1/2. Building onthesefindings, inRef.[25]
it was argued that at ν= 0+energy conservation in
quantum-chaotic local Hamiltonians [26] plays a similar
role to that of U(1)symmetry in random pure states.
In this work, we study the subleading corrections to
the average entanglement entropy of midspectrum eigen-
states in quantum-chaotic interacting spin-1/2 chains
without U(1)symmetry [21–25] and with U(1)symme-
try [6]. We carry out state-of-the-art numerical calcula-
tions of clean spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models with in-
tegrability breaking terms in chains with periodic and
open boundary conditions. Using various quantum chaos
indicators, we first scan a wide range of parameters for
those models and introduce the concept of the maximally
chaotic regime. Namely, a regime in Hamiltonian pa-
rameters in which, for the chain sizes that are accessible
to full exact diagonalization calculations, the quantum-
chaos indicators considered are closest to the random
matrix theory predictions. It is in this regime that we
find that the midspectrum energy eigenstates exhibit the
greatest entanglement entropy. We then carry out finite-
size scaling analyzes of the average eigenstate entangle-
ment entropy in the maximally chaotic regime.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we in-
troduce the models under consideration and discuss de-
tails about our numerical calculations. The maximally
chaotic regime is identified in Sec. III. The results for the
finite-size scaling analyzes of the average entanglement
entropy of midspectrum energy eigenstates are presented
in Sec. IV. We summarize our results in Sec. V.3
II. MODELS
We study the clean spin- 1/2XYZ chain ( ˆHXYZ) with
nearest- ( ˆH1) and next-nearest- ( ˆH2) neighbors interac-
tions in a magnetic field ( ˆHF):

ˆHF=X
ℓ(hzˆsz
ℓ+hxˆsx
ℓ),
where ˆsτ
ℓ, with τ=x, y, z, are the spin-1/2 operators at
siteℓ. We fix the five parameters J1= 1(unit of energy),
η= 0.5,∆1= 0.3,∆2= 0.3, and hx= 0.3, whereas the
remaining two parameters J2, hzare determined by the
analysis discussed in Sec. III.
In our full exact diagonalization calculations, we con-
sider chains with periodic boundary conditions, i.e.,
ˆsτ
L+1= ˆsτ
1andˆsτ
L+2= ˆsτ
2(τ=x, y, z), and with open
boundary conditions. With periodic boundary condi-
tions, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (9) exhibits translation
symmetry. We resolve it resulting in a block-diagonal
structure of the Hamiltonian in which each block is la-
beled by the total quasimomentum kand has a total
number of states ∼2L/L. The blocks with k= 0and
πare further split using the reflection symmetry also
present in the Hamiltonian, resulting in sub-blocks with
∼2L/(2L)states. For open boundary conditions, only
reflection symmetry is present, resulting in a splitting of
the Hamiltonian in two blocks with ∼2L/2states. For
periodic boundary conditions, the largest chains that we
study have L= 22fork= 0andπ, and L= 20for all the
other total quasimomentum sectors. For open boundary
conditions, the largest chains that we study have L= 18.
The second model we study is the clean spin- 1/2XXZ
chain ( ˆHXXZ) with nearest- ( ˆH′
1) and next-nearest- ( ˆH′

neighbors interactions:

which is obtained from Eq. (9) by setting η=hx=hz=
0. We fix J1= 1and∆2= 0.3, whereas the remaining
parameters J2,∆1are determined by the analysis dis-
cussed in Sec. III.
The spin- 1/2XXZ chain has an additional U(1)sym-
metry, so that the total magnetization ( ˆSz=P
ℓˆsz
ℓ) is
a conserved quantity. At zero magnetization, it further
has a ( Z2) spin-flip symmetry. We resolve both sym-
metries in our calculations, which are carried out in thezero total magnetization sector. For chains with peri-
odic boundary conditions, this further reduces the num-
ber of states in the blocks that need to be diagonalized
to∼ L
L/2
/(4L)atk= 0andπ, and∼ L
L/2
/(2L)for all
other total quasimomentum sectors. For the chains with
open boundary conditions, we need to fully diagonalize
blocks with ∼ L
L/2
/4states. For periodic boundary
conditions, we study chains with up to L= 26fork= 0
andπ, and up to L= 24for all other ksectors. For open
boundary conditions, we study chains with up to L= 20.
Unless stated otherwise, the exact diagonalization re-
sults reported correspond to averages over all symmetry
blocks for any given chain size L, and the number of
eigenstates reported in the context of the averages is the
one taken from each symmetry block.
III. MAXIMALLY CHAOTIC REGIME
Several quantities, associated to the eigenenergies or
to the energy eigenstates, have been traditionally used
to quantify “quantum chaos” in many-body interacting
Hamiltonians [27]. They are computed in model Hamil-
tonians and compared to the predictions from random
matrix theory (RMT). Their agreement, or the improve-
ment of their agreement with increasing system size, are
considered a hallmark of many-body quantum chaos.
Since various limits of one-dimensional chains (such as
the ones considered here) are integrable, when carrying
out scaling analyses to make predictions about generic
quantum-chaotic interacting models it is desirable to be
as “far away” as possible from integrable points. In this
spirit, in this section we identify the maximally chaotic
regimefor the chain sizes that we can study using full
exact diagonalization calculations of the Hamiltonians in
Sec.II.Themaximallychaoticregimeistheregimeinthe
model parameters in which we find the closest agreement
between the exact diagonalization results and the RMT
predictions.
A. Level spacing ratio
The statistical properties of the eigenenergies {Eα}of
quantum many-body Hamiltonians are one of the most
commonly used indicators of quantum chaos [27]. One of
the simplest and most studied associated quantity is the
distribution of the ratios of consecutive level spacings,
defined as [28]:
rα=min{δα, δα+1}
max{δα, δα+1}, (11)
where δα=Eα−Eα−1is the energy difference between
consecutive levels. The RMT prediction for the aver-
age of rαin the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) is
¯rGOE= 0.5307[29], and this is the result one expects to
obtain in quantum-chaotic interacting Hamiltonians.4

In Fig. 1(a) [Fig. 1(b)], we show the average level spac-
ing ratio ¯rfor the XYZ [XXZ] model as a function of J2
for different values of hz[∆1] in a chain with L= 18
[L= 20]. For both the XYZ and XXZ models, the de-
viations from the GOE predictions are greatest for small
values of J2. For the XYZ chain, we also find that large
values of hzextend the regime in J2in which greater de-
viations are seen from the RMT prediction, while in the
XXZ model the extent of that region is quite insensitive
to the value of ∆1for the range of parameters shown. In
Figs. 1(c) and 1(d), we show exemplary distributions of r
for four sets of Hamiltonian parameters for the XYZ and
XXZ models, respectively, and how they compare to the
predictions for the GOE and the Poisson distribution.
Our results in Fig. 1 show that there is a broad regime
(of the two Hamiltonian parameters that we have not
fixed in both models) in which there is a nearly perfect
agreement with the GOE predictions (up to the statisti-
cal fluctuations necessarily present in our finite samples
of eigenenergies). The parameters of both models that
are fixed in Fig. 1 were selected to ensure such an agree-
ment with the GOE predictions for a wide range of the
parameters left to fix. We spare the readers a discussion
of that tedious broader exploration.B. Eigenstate coefficients
Next, we study the distribution of eigenstate coeffi-
cients, which we find to be a more sensitive diagnostic of
quantum chaos than r. Specifically, given a Hamiltonian
eigenstate ψα=P
mcα
m|m⟩, expanded in the computa-
tional basis { |m⟩}, we study the distribution of cα
mover
the midspectrum eigenstates.
Duetothepresenceoftranslationsymmetry,thecoeffi-
cientsarecomplexinalltotalquasimomentumsectorsex-
cept for k= 0andπ. Hence, we proceed in two steps. In
the first step, we consider eigenstates from a single sym-
metry block. If the eigenstate coefficients are complex,
then we rescale both the real and the imaginary parts
separately by their corresponding standard deviations
σ[i.e., Re(cα
m)→Re(cα
m)/σandIm(cα
m)→Im(cα
m)/σ,
where σ∝1/√
2Dwith Dthe number of states in the
corresponding sector], while in case of real coefficients
we directly rescale the coefficients (i.e., cα
m→cα
m/σ,
where σ∝1/√
Dwith Dthe number of states in the
corresponding sector). In the second step, we collect
the rescaled real and imaginary parts of all the coeffi-
cients and study the statistics of their absolute values,
denoted as zin this paper. The probability density func-
tion (PDF) of z,P(z), is contrasted to a Gaussian PDF
of the form
¯P(z) =2√
2πe−z2
2, (12)
where a prefactor of 2 appears in the numerator because
we study the distribution of absolute values, see Ap-
pendix B. We split and analyze the distributions of the
coefficients this way to avoid having to deal with differ-
ent distributions for the real and complex sectors. The
distribution of the absolute values of coefficients cα
min
the complex sectors follows a chi-squared distribution,
see Appendix B for details.
The main panels of Fig. 2 show the PDFs P(z)for the
XYZ [Fig. 2(a)] and XXZ [Fig. 2(b)] models. We take
J2= 1.0, for which the average level spacing ratio ¯rin
Fig. 1 matches the GOE prediction for the model param-
eters under investigation. The results in Fig. 2 show that
the distribution of eigenstate coefficients is a more sensi-
tive probe of many-body quantum chaos than r. Specif-
ically, all the PDFs in Fig. 2 show deviations from the
Gaussian distribution ¯P(z), which are most visible in the
tails of the distributions. Several works [22, 30–33] have
studied distributions of eigenstate coefficients and also
observed deviations from the Gaussian distribution.
We find that, for J2= 1.0, the PDFs P(z)are closest
to the Gaussian function ¯P(z)at small hz<1in the
XYZ model and at small ∆1<1in the XXZ model. In
order to quantify the deviations from the Gaussian PDF,
as done in Ref. [5], we compute the ratio

(L= 20). The dashed lines show ¯P(z)from Eq. (12). Insets:

the main panels for three values of J2(J2= 1.0,2.0, and 4.0).
The results for Γψin the insets are plotted as functions of (a)
hz, and (b) ∆1.
which yields Γψ=π/2for the Gaussian PDF from
Eq.(12). Numericalresultsfor Γψareshownintheinsets
of Fig. 2 for J2= 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 as functions of (a) hz
for the XYZ model and (b) ∆1for the XXZ model. From
those plots we conclude that, for the closest agreement
with the RMT prediction, one needs small values of hz
for the XYZ model and small values of ∆1for the XXZ
model and that, in the latter regimes, J2∼2.0gives the
values that are closest to π/2.
In Appendix A, we show as density plots the normal-
izeddifferences |Γψ−π/2|/(π/2)asfunctionsof J2,hzfor
the XYZ model and as functions of J2,∆1for the XXZ
model. We compare them with results for the normal-
ized differences |¯r−¯rGOE|/¯rGOEcomputed in the same
parameter regimes. Those plots provide a more com-
plete picture of the regimes in which the results for the
model Hamiltonians are closest to the RMT predictions
and about the sensitivity of the results obtained for ¯rvs
that of the results obtained for Γψ.
As a side remark, we note that for the system sizes
considered in Fig. 2, Γψis slightly greater than π/2
even in the maximally chaotic regime of both models.
In Appendix C, we carry out finite-size scaling analy-
ses of the normalized difference |Γψ−π/2|/(π/2)for the
XYZmodelinchainswithbothperiodicandopenbound-
ary conditions. We show that the normalized differences
decrease with increasing system size, but they decrease
more slowly than for eigenstates of random matrices and
than for pure random states with coefficients that are
drawn from a normal distribution.C. Average eigenstate entanglement entropy
To close this section on the maximally chaotic regime,
we explore the behavior of the eigenstate entanglement
entropy SAof Hamiltonian eigenstates, see Eq. (2). We
focusonbipartitionsintwohalves, i.e., wesetthesubsys-
tem fraction to f= 1/2, and study the same parameter
regimes of the Hamiltonians as in Secs. IIIA and IIIB.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the average entanglement
entropy ¯SAin both models for the same Hamiltonian
parameters as those in the study of the average level
spacing ¯rin Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). We average SAover
100 midspectrum eigenstates from each symmetry block
and divide the results by the two leading terms in Page’s
prediction, see ⟨SA⟩in Eq. (5). A comparison between
Fig. 3(a) [Fig. 3(b)] and Fig. 1(a) [Fig. 1(b)] reveals a
similar trend between the deviation of ¯SAfrom Page’s
leading-order prediction and the deviation of ¯rfrom the
RMT prediction. We do note that the deviations in the
average entanglement entropy are more pronounced at
small J2in both models. This is more prominent for the
XXZ model in Fig. 3(b), for which we find that ¯SAat
moderate ∆1increases with J2even in the regime J2>1.
This observation motivate us in the next section to set
J2= 2.0to carry out the scaling analyses.

Page’s result the narrower is the distribution (or, what
is the same, higher averages come from narrower distri-
butions). Narrow distributions of eigenstate expectation
values of few-body observables are a hallmark of eigen-
state thermalization and, hence, of quantum chaos [27].
It is remarkable that the same applies to the entangle-
ment entropy of 1/2 of the system, which is a multi-
body observable. The most chaotic regime in Fig. 3(c)
[Fig. 3(d)] is found to be the regime of J2∼2and small
hz(∆1) in the XYZ (XXZ) model.
Summarizing our analysis in this section, we showed
that all three quantities under investigation, the level
spacing ratio ¯r, the statistics of the eigenstate coeffi-
cients cα
m, and the eigenstate entanglement entropy SA
yieldconsistentinformationaboutthedegreeofquantum
chaos in different regimes of model parameters, with the
latter two depending more strongly on the values of the
model parameters.
IV. SCALING OF THE AVERAGE
ENTANGLEMENT ENTROPY
We now turn our attention to the main subject of our
work, i.e., the behavior of the average entanglement en-
tropy of midspectrum eigenstates. We are interested in
exploring their scaling with the system size and with the
fraction of midspectrum eigenstates taken to carry out
the average. Motivated by the results from Sec. III and
Appendix A, we select model parameters for which the
system is found to be maximally chaotic. Specifically,
we set J2= 2.0andhz= 0.2for the XYZ model and
J2= 2.0and∆1= 0.2for the XXZ model.
It is well known that the eigenstate entanglement en-
tropy of local Hamiltonians is a concave function of the
eigenenergies, with a maximum in the middle of the en-
ergy spectrum, namely, about ¯E=Tr(ˆH)/D, with Dbe-
ing the dimension of the entire Hilbert space [7, 8, 22, 26,
34, 35]. This property is illustrated in the insets in Fig. 4
for our two models, using periodic (top panels) and open
(bottom panels) boundary conditions. In those insets,
we plot Sα
Avs∆Eα=Eα−¯Efor all symmetry blocks,
where ¯Eis the average energy in the symmetry block to
which Eαbelongs ( ¯E→¯Ewith increasing system size,
as shown in Fig. 13). Consequently, in finite systems, the

average eigenstate entanglement entropy depends on the
number of states used to carry out the average. In large
systems, as we show in what follows, this translates into
a dependence of the subleading O(1)term on the fraction
of eigenstates used to carry out the averages.

puted as an average ¯S(Λ)

spectrum eigenstates, the insets in Fig. 4 (containing all

andcis independent of the system size. This is demon-
strated by the data collapse seen in the main panels in
Fig. 4, in which we plot ¯S(Λ)

Avs(∆Eα/σ)2for the
entire energy spectrum in chains with different sizes. Re-
markably, the fits of the numerical results in insets in
Fig. 4 to Eqs. (14) and (15) show that those equations
provide an excellent description of Sα
Aover most of the
energy spectrum. This is further confirmed by the data
collapse in the main panels, which occurs about the fits.
In this work we carry out two types of averages for the
eigenstate entanglement entropy. The first one was al-
ready mentioned before, namely we average over a fixed
number Λof midspectrum eigenstates. This fixed num-
ber, as one increases the system size, corresponds to
an exponentially vanishing fraction relative to the total
number of eigenstates. The energy eigenstates in that
average have eigenenergies Eα→¯Eexponentially fast
with increasing system size. In the second type of av-
erage, we use a finite fraction νof midspectrum eigen-
states, ν∈(0,1], and we denote the average as ¯S(ν)
A. It
is important to emphasize that, when computing the av-
erages, we define the “midspectrum eigenstates” for each
symmetry block separately, i.e., they are the eigenstates
whose eigenenergies are closest to the mean energy ¯Ein
each symmetry block.
Using Eqs. (14) and (15), we can estimate the depen-
dence of the average eigenstate entanglement entropy on
the fraction νof midspectrum eigenstates used to com-
pute the averages. Let us begin by noticing that, for
models with few-body interactions (our interest here),
the density of states is Gaussian about the mean energy
¯E. Introducing a new variable E=E−¯E, we can write
ρ(E) =D1√
2πσe−E2
2σ2,so thatZ∞
−∞ρ(E)dE=D,
(17)
and has a variance σ2∝L[36, 37].
Using Eq. (17), we can write
ν=1
DZEν
−Eνρ(E)dE= erfEν√

,(18)
which shows that Eν∝σ∝√
Lforν∈(0,1). The
average entanglement entropy over this energy window is
then given by
¯S(ν)

In Secs. IVA and IVB, we report numerical results

XXZ chains, respectively. We show that, after comput-
ing¯S(Λ)
Aand fitting c2, Eq. (21) describes the results for
¯S(ν)
Ain our numerical calculations. When meaningful, in
Secs. IVA and IVB, we will also report results for the
maximal and minimal eigenstate entanglement entropies
within the set of states over which the average is carried
out. In contrast to the average eigenstate entanglement
entropies, the maximal and minimal eigenstate entangle-
ment entropies are not averaged over symmetry blocks.
We select the maximal and minimal over the entire set
containing all sectors and refer to them as the “outlier”
eigenstate entanglement entropies. They bound the re-
sultsfortheentanglemententropiesinthesetconsidered.
All the results in the main text correspond to the sub-
system fraction f= 1/2. Results for other system frac-
tions are shown in Appendix E.
A. XYZ model
In order to carry out a finite-size scaling analysis for
the XYZ model, in this section we compute the average
entanglemententropyofenergyeigenstatesinchainswith
different sizes L. We then subtract the numerical results
obtained from the prediction by Page [20] for the average
over randompurestatesina fullHilbertspace H=HA⊗

2L−LA, which has the form [4]:

where Ψ(z) = (ln Γ( z))′= Γ′(z)/Γ(z)is the digamma
function. At subsystem fraction f=LA/L, the two lead-
ing terms for Eq. (22) are given in Eq. (5).

the differences for the outlier eigenstate entanglement en-
tropies. In the main panels we show results for periodic
and open boundary conditions, while in the insets we
show results for periodic boundary conditions for aver-
ages over all quasimomentum sectors (as shown in the
main panels) and only over k= 0andπ(for which the
largest system sizes can be diagonalized). We also show,
as horizontal dashed lines, the prediction of Eq. (7) for
the specific value of νunder consideration.
In Fig. 5(a) and its inset, for Λ = 100 midspectrum
eigenstates, one can see that with increasing system size
the difference between the average over random pure
states and the average over Hamiltonian eigenstates ap-
pears to saturate at a small O(1)number that is smaller
than, but likely of the order of, 0.1. This O(1)number
seems to be slightly smaller than the one predicted by
Eq. (7), which, as mentioned in the introduction, is iden-
tical to the result for the average over random pure states
with fixed magnetization sz= 0atf= 1/2[n= 1/2and
f= 1/2in Eq. (3)].
In Figs. 5(b)–5(d), one can see that with increasing
system size ⟨SA⟩ −¯S(ν)
Aapproaches a nonzero O(1)con-
stant whose value increases with ν. In Fig. 6, we plot
the difference ⟨SA⟩ −¯S(ν)
Avsνfor a chain with periodic
boundary conditions (PBCs) ( L= 20) and for a chain
with open boundary conditions (OBCs) ( L= 18). In
both cases we find the difference to be in excellent agree-
ment with the prediction of Eq. (21), with the values of
¯S(Λ)
Aandc2taken from the curves shown in the insets9
in Figs. 4(a) and 4(c). Since the results for large sys-
tems with PBCs and OBCs are expected to agree up to
corrections that vanish in the thermodynamic limit, the
fact that the PBC and OBC results are slightly different
makes clear that they still suffer from finite-size effects
andareexpectedtodecrease(likelyonlyslightly)iflarger
system sizes are considered.
Like in Fig. 5(a), in Figs. 5(b)–5(d) as well as in Fig. 6,
we consistently find our numerical results to be below
the predictions from Eq. (7). The results for the out-
liers in Figs. 5(a)–5(c) further show the range of values
over which the average is carried out. Figure 5(a) shows
that, strikingly, the least entangled Hamiltonian eigen-
states among the Λ = 100 midspectrum eigenstates, the
ones with the largest ⟨SA⟩−Sα
A, are already at the value
for the average predicted by Eq. (7). This strengthens
our expectation that ¯S(ν)
Awill be greater than the pre-
diction from Eq. (7) for ν= 0+[for an O(1)number of
eigenstates] in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore,
the results in Fig. 6 show that ¯S(ν)
Afrom Eq. (7) does not
capture the functional dependence of ⟨SA⟩ −¯S(ν)
Avsν
observed in the numerical results. Given our Eq. (21),
we expect that ¯S(ν)
Awill in general depend on the model
Hamiltonian under consideration through a potentially
nonuniversal O(1)term in ¯S(Λ)
Aand the constant c.
In Appendix C, we report scalings similar to the one
in Fig. 5(a) obtained for other Hamiltonian parameters
across and beyond the maximally chaotic regime. They
show that the results in Fig. 5(a) are robust against
changes in the Hamiltonian parameters and, hence, that
our findings and conclusions are not a consequence of a
fine tuning of parameters for the specific model under
consideration.
B. XXZ model
In order to carry out the finite-size scaling analysis for
the XXZ model, we subtract our numerical results from
the exact result obtained when averaging over random
states in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces at fixed zero
magnetization, or, in the spinless fermions language, at
fixed half filling. Using the latter (more convenient) lan-
guage, the Hilbert space H(N)of a system with Nspin-
less fermions in Lsites is a direct sum of tensor prod-
ucts of Hilbert spaces in subsystems A(with LAsites
andNAfermions) and B(with LB=L−LAsites and

They suggest that for the models considered the devia-
tions of ¯S(ν)
A, for any given value of ν, from the result for
the average over random states is nearly independent of
whether the Hamiltonian exhibits or not U(1)symmetry
(particle-number conservation). We emphasize that this
is the case despite the fact that the O(1)subleading term
in⟨SA⟩(from which the XYZ results are subtracted) and
in⟨SA⟩n(fromwhichtheXXZresultsaresubtracted)are
different, see Eqs. (3) and (5).In Fig. 8, we plot ⟨SA⟩n−¯S(ν)
Avsνfor a chain with
PBCs ( L= 24) and for a chain with OBCs ( L= 20).
The plots are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to
the ones seen for the XYZ model in Fig. 6. Also like
in Fig. 6, we find that ⟨SA⟩n−¯S(ν)
Avsνis in excellent
agreementwiththepredictionofEq.(21), withthevalues
of¯S(Λ)
Aandc2taken from the curves shown in the insets
in Figs. 4(b) and 4(d). We note that, both in Figs. 6
and 8, the average over up to ∼20%of the midspectrum
eigenstatesbarelychangestheresultfromthatat ν= 0+.
Those fractions can be used in numerical calculations to
reduce fluctuations in the average over the entanglement
entropy of Hamiltonian eigenstates associated to finite-
size effects, while still producing results that are close to
those at ν= 0+.
In Appendix C, we report scalings similar to the one
in Fig. 7(a) obtained for other Hamiltonian parameters
across and beyond the maximally chaotic regime. They
show that the results in Fig. 7(a) are robust against
changes in the Hamiltonian parameters and, hence, that
our findings and conclusions are not a consequence of a
fine tuning of the parameters for the specific model under
consideration.
V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
We carried out a state-of-the-art computational study
of the O(1)subleading corrections to the leading volume-
law term of the average entanglement entropy of mid-
spectrum eigenstates in nonintegrable spin-1/2 XYZ and
XXZ chains. We focused on the subsystem fraction
f= 1/2, and for the XXZ chain [which has U(1)symme-
try] we focused on the zero magnetization sector.
For a fixed number Λof midspectrum Hamiltonian
eigenstates in the average ( Λ = 100, i.e., the fraction of
Hamiltonian eigenstates ν= 0+), we found indications
that the average eigenstate entanglement entropy differs
by a small O(1)number from the prediction for the aver-
age over random states in the thermodynamic limit. The
magnitude of the difference was ≲0.1both for the XYZ
[does not have U(1)symmetry] and the XXZ [has U(1)
symmetry] chains. While the magnitude of the difference
was found to be similar in the absence or presence of the
U(1)symmetry, it is important to emphasize that the
average over random states exhibits an O(1)term that
does depend on whether the average is carried out over
states in which the magnetization is fixed or not [4].
We also found indications that the fixed- Λaverage en-
tanglement entropy of eigenstates of the XYZ model dif-
fers from Huang’s prediction (the former is greater for
the models and parameters considered here) in the ther-
modynamic limit. Huang’s O(1)correction at ν= 0+
is identical to the O(1)“mean-field” correction derived
in Ref. [6] for the average over random pure states at
fixed particle number (fixed magnetization in the spin
language). In Appendix D, we show that a finite-size
scaling analysis of the difference between the average11
entanglement entropy of eigenstates of the XYZ model
and the analytic prediction for the average over random
purestatesatfixedzeromagnetizationalsoindicatesthat
those two averages exhibit an O(1)difference. This is
understandable as the energy conservation constraint in
quantum-chaotic local Hamiltonians [25, 26] in general
does not produce the same structure in the Hilbert space
as that introduced by the U(1)symmetry. In the pres-
ence of latter, quantum states can be decomposed using
direct sums of tensor products, which is not possible (in
general) in the presence of the former. In the context
ofSU(2)symmetry, in Ref. [38] it was argued that “in-
terferences” not accounted for in decompositions involv-
ing direct sums of tensor products can introduce O(1)
corrections. This motivates us to conjecture that the
O(1)correction in quantum-chaotic local Hamiltonians is
not universal. To explore the validity of this conjecture,
we plan to study the average entanglement entropy over
eigenstates of different kinds of random matrices (SYK
models being specific examples).
When considering fixed nonvanishing fractions of mid-
spectrum Hamiltonian eigenstates in the average, ν∈
(0,1], we found that the average eigenstate entanglement
entropy differs by a ν-dependent O(1)correction from
the prediction for the average over random states with
increasing system size. For this case, we provided a sim-
ple expression for the O(1)deviation expected from the
maximal result at ν= 0+as a function of ν. This phe-
nomenological expression was obtained using the concave
functional form of the eigenstate entanglement entropy,
which exhibits a maximum in the middle of the spectrum
of local quantum-chaotic Hamiltonians, and the known
Gaussian form of the density of states in such models.
Our analytical expression provides an excellent descrip-
tion of the numerical results for the average entangle-
ment entropy, after numerically computing one parame-
ter (¯S(Λ)
A) and fitting a second one ( c) using the numeri-
cal results for the eigenstate entanglement entropy vs the
eigenenergies.
Our numerical results for a nonvanishing νalso indi-
catethattheaverageentanglemententropyineigenstates
of the XYZ model differs from Huang’s prediction (the
averageovereigenstatesisgreater)inthethermodynamic
limit. Huang’s O(1)correction in the ν= 1limit is iden-
tical to the O(1)term derived in Ref. [4] for the average
overrandompurestateswithfixedparticlenumber(fixed
magnetization in the spin language) when averaging over
all particle-number sectors with a weight that is deter-
mined by the number of states in each sector. An inter-
esting question to be explored in the future is what the
O(1)correctionsat ν= 0+andnonvanishing νcantellus
about the Hamiltonian. For the (integrable) XY model
in a transverse field, in Refs. [12, 14] is was shown that
there is an O(1)correction at the critical line ( h=J) for
f >0, and no O(1)correction otherwise, so that such a
correction can be used to identify the critical line.
Finally, we should mention that while the focus of this
work was the nature of the O(1)correction at f= 1/2,we have also studied what happens when f̸= 1/2. We
briefly discuss those results in Appendix E. Our main
finding away from f= 1/2is that, for a fixed number
of midspectrum Hamiltonian eigenstates in the average
(Λ = 100), the average eigenstate entanglement entropy
also appears to differ by a small O(1)correction from
the prediction for the average over random states in the
thermodynamic limit. The difference obtained in our nu-
merical calculations is clearly smaller than the one for
f= 1/2, and appears to decrease with decreasing the
value of f. This parallels the behavior of the O(1)mean-
field term in Eq. (4). Determining the functional form of
theO(1)correction in model Hamiltonians as a function
offis something that deserves a future investigation.

Appendix A: Maximally chaotic regime
In Sec. III, we described how we locate the maximally
chaotic regime and reported results for exemplary sets
of parameters considered. Here we report results for the
full set of parameters that we explored in some detail for
the XYZ and the XXZ models.
The XYZ model studied in this work has a large
parameter space, with six independent parameters
(J2, η,∆1,∆2, hz,andhx) after setting J1= 1to be
our energy scale [see Eq. (9)]. We select η= 0.5, in the
middle between the Ising point ( η= 1) and the XXZ
point ( η= 0). In our early broader exploration of the
space spanned by the other five parameters, we noticed
that the results do not depend strongly on the strength
of the transverse field hxunless it is made too large,
which results in a departure from quantum chaotic be-
havior. Moreover, we found that when ∆1and∆2are
both∼0.3, there is a wide range of values of J2andhz
for which the numerical results for the various quantum
chaos indicators considered here are close to the RMT
predictions. This motivated us to set hx= 0.3,∆1= 0.3,
and∆2= 0.3.
For XYZ chains with L= 18and PBCs, in Fig. 9
we show density plots of the normalized differences be-
tween the numerical results and the RMT predictions for
our quantum chaos indicators in the ( J2, hz) plane. Fig-
ure 9(a) shows results for the average gap ratio [supple-
menting the results in Fig. 1(a)], Fig. 9(b) shows results

The results for all the quantum chaos indicators re-
ported in Fig. 9 consistently show that the largest devi-
ations from the RMT predictions occur in the regime of
small J2and large hz. On the other hand, for identify-
ing the maximally chaotic regime, the results reported in
Figs. 9(b) and 9(c) are the most useful ones. We find the

lowest normalized differences there to occur for J2∼2.0
andhz<0.5(for the values of hzreported). This moti-
vated us to selected J2= 2.0andhz= 0.2for the scaling
analysis of the average entanglement entropy discussed
in Sec. IV.
The XXZ model studied in this work has three inde-
pendentparameters( J2,∆1,and∆2)aftersetting J1= 1
to be our energy scale [see Eq. (10)]. We set ∆2= 0.3, as
for the XYZ model, because it results in a wide range of
values of J2and∆1for which the numerical results for
thevariousquantumchaosindicatorsconsideredareclose
to the RMT predictions. For XXZ chains with L= 2013
and PBCs, in Fig. 10 we show density plots of the nor-
malizeddifferencesbetweenthenumericalresultsandthe
RMT predictions for our quantum chaos indicators in the
(J2,∆1) plane. Those results parallel the ones in Fig. 9
for the XYZ chains, and supplement the results reported
in Fig. 1(b), in the inset in Fig. 2(b), and in Fig. 3(b).
For small values of ∆1and intermediate values of J2∼2,
there is less structure in Figs. 10(b) and 10(c) than for
small values of hzand intermediate values of J2∼2in
Figs. 9(b) and 9(c). From the wider range of parame-
ters that give results in the XXZ chain that are similarly
close to the RMT predictions, we selected J2= 2.0and
∆1= 0.2for the scaling analysis of the average entangle-
ment entropy discussed in Sec. IV.
Appendix B: Distribution of eigenstate coefficients
In Sec. IIIB, we reported results for the distributions
of the absolute values of the scaled real and imaginary
parts of the eigenstate coefficients in the computational
basis, which we denoted as z. Those distributions were
compared to the Gaussian distribution in Eq. (12). The
latter distribution was derived assuming that the scaled
real and imaginary parts xof the eigenstate coefficients
are Gaussian with variance 1,
¯PX(x) =1√
2πe−x2/2. (B1)
To derive PZ(z), we note that z=g(x) =|x|. In
general, if g(x)is an invertible function, then one can
calculate the probability distribution of zusing the for-
mula
¯PZ(z=g(x)) = ¯PX(g−1(z))dg−1(z)
dz,(B2)
and, for piecewise invertible functions, given the set for
x=h(z)
hi(z) :∃x1
i,x2
ih−1
i(x) =g(x)forx∈(x1
i, x2
i),
Eq. (B2) can be generalized as
¯PZ(z=g(x)) =X
i¯PX(hi(z))dhi(z)
dz.(B3)
Hence, the distribution of zis given by
¯PZ(z) =¯PX(z)+¯PX(−z) =1√
2πe−z2/2+1√
2πe−(−z)2/2,
(B4)
which yields the result in Eq. (12).
Instead of studying the distributions of the absolute
values zof the scaled real and imaginary parts of the
eigenstate coefficients in the computational basis, which
allowed us to treat all the quasimomentum sectors on
an equal footing, one can separately study the distribu-
tions of the absolute values zof the scaled real eigenstate

In Figs. 11(a) and 11(c) [Figs. 11(b) and 11(d)], we
show results obtained for the distributions of the scaled
(by the corresponding standard deviation) absolute val-
ues of eigenstate coefficients for the XYZ model in chains
with L= 18[the XXZ model in chains with L= 20] and
PBCs. The top panels [Figs. 11(a) and 11(b)] show re-
sults for the k= 0, πquasimomentum sectors compared
to the PDF (dashed line) in Eq. (12), while the bot-
tom panels [Figs. 11(c) and 11(d)] show results for the
k̸= 0, πquasimomentum sectors compared to the PDF
(dashedline)inEq.(B6). Resultsfor Γψareshowninthe
insets, in which the horizontal lines mark the prediction
for the PDF of Eq. (12) in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b), and the
prediction of Eq. (B9) in Figs. 11(c) and 11(d). These
results can be seen as being complementary to the ones
in Fig. 2, where we reported results for the distribution of
the absolute values of the scaled real and imaginary parts
of the eigenstate coefficients from all symmetry blocks
(all values of k) bundled together.
The results in Fig. 11 suggest that the convergence to
the predictions for random states is faster in the k= 0, π
sectors, compare the agreement with the theoretical pre-
dictions seen in Figs. 11(a) and 11(b) vs in Figs. 11(c)
and 11(d), even though for any given value of Lthe “real”
sectors have 1/2 of the number of states in the other sec-
tors (due to the presence of reflection symmetry). In themaximally chaotic regime, the PDFs in the XYZ model
are the ones that we find to be closest to the theoretical
predictions. Notice that, for the parameters shown, the
set selected for the scaling in Sec. IV is the one that gives
the closest results to the theoretical predictions.
We also note that for the results shown in the insets
in Figs. 2 and 11, even in the maximally chaotic regime
of both models, Γψis slightly larger than the theoretical
prediction for random states. In Appendix C, we report
the scaling of the normalized difference |Γψ−π/2|/(π/2)
for the XYZ model in chains with both periodic and open
boundary conditions. They show that, as expected, the
normalized differences decrease with increasing system
size. In Fig. 12, we show how |Γψ−π/2|/(π/2)depends
on the inverse Hilbert space dimension 1/Dfor midspec-
trum eigenstates of matrices that belong to the GOE
and for random pure states whose coefficients are sam-
pled from a normal distribution. In those two cases, the
deviations from the predicted value of π/2in the ther-
modynamic limit are much smaller than for Hamiltonian
eigenstates and decrease as 1/D.

ters, so long as the parameters are not taken to be too
far from the maximally chaotic regime.
In Fig. 14, we plot ⟨SA⟩ −¯S(Λ)
Afor the XYZ model for
six pairs of values of (J2, hz). The results in Fig. 14(b)
are the same as in Fig. 5(a). The theoretical results for
the random pure states ⟨SA⟩are the ones predicted by
Eq. (22). As in Fig. 5, we include the maximal and min-
imal outliers, which bound the eigenstate entanglement
entropies that enter the averages. In Fig. 14, J2increases16
from left to right, while hzincreases from top to bot-

for the same parameters as in the main panels vs 1/LA.

insets depend more strongly on the parameters chosen,

ferences, and are consistent with a polynomial decrease
with 1/LA= 2/LasLincreases.
In Fig. 15, we plot ⟨SA⟩n−¯S(Λ)
Afor the XXZ model for
six pairs of values of (J2,∆1). The results in Fig. 15(b)
are the same as in Fig. 7(a). The theoretical results for
the random pure states ⟨SA⟩nare the ones predicted by
Eq. (25). As in Fig. 7, we include the maximal and min-
imal outliers, which bound the eigenstate entanglement
entropies that enter the averages. In Fig. 15, J2increases
from left to right, while ∆1increases from top to bottom.

to be smaller than 0.1in all panels.
Appendix D: XYZ eigenstates vs random states

tical to that predicted for random pure states at zero

to the exact result for random pure states at fixed zero

clearly smaller than when comparing to the exact result
for random pure states ⟨SA⟩[see Eq. (22)], but we find
no indication that they will vanish in the thermodynamic
limit. For the parameters considered, our numerical re-
sults suggest that ¯S(Λ)

Appendix E: Subsystem fractions f̸= 1/2
All the previous results for the average eigenstate en-
tanglement entropy were computed for a subsystem frac-
tionf=LA/L= 1/2. Here we report results obtained
for smaller subsystem fractions. For the XYZ model, for
which there is no restriction on the value of the magne-
tization and hence for which we can study chains with
even and odd numbers of sites, we consider f= 1/3and
f= 1/4. For the XXZ model, for which we restrict our
study to the zero total magnetization sector and hence
only study chains with an even number of sites, we only
consider f= 1/4.
Figure 17 shows results for the XYZ model in the max-
imally chaotic regime when J2= 2.0andhz= 0.2(same
parameters as in Sec. IVA), for f= 1/4[Fig. 17(a)] and
f= 1/3[Fig.17(b)]. Weagainfindindicationsofan O(1)
difference in the thermodynamic limit, but with a value
that appears to depend on f. Notice that the deviation
from the results for random pure states ⟨SA⟩is smaller
atf= 1/4[Fig. 17(a)], than at f= 1/3[Fig. 17(b)].
In both cases the differences are much smaller than at

both PBCs and OBCs.17

the limited sizes accessible for OBCs.f= 1/2. This suggests that if the difference remains
nonzero in the thermodynamic limit, then the O(1)con-
tribution is likely to decrease with decreasing f.
Figure 18 shows results for the XXZ model in the max-
imally chaotic regime when J2= 2.0and∆1= 0.2(same
parameters as in Sec. IVB). Only three system sizes are
accessible for PBCs at f= 1/4, but the results are qual-
itatively and quantitatively similar to those for the XYZ
model at f= 1/4in Fig. 17(a). Together with the results
for the XYZ model at f= 1/3in Fig. 17(b), our numer-
ical results suggest that the O(1)difference, if nonzero
in the thermodynamic limit, is much smaller for f <1/3
than at f= 1/2.
