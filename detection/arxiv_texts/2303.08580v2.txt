We re-examine the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions on the collective amplitude and
phase modes in the incommensurate charge-density-wave ground state of quasi-one-dimensional
conductors. Using an effective action approach we show that the longitudinal acoustic phonon
protects the gapless linear dispersion of the lowest phase mode in the presence of long-range Coulomb
interactions. Moreover, in Gaussian approximation, amplitude fluctuations are not affected by long-
range Coulomb interactions. We also calculate the collective mode dispersions at finite temperatures
and compare our results with the measured energies of amplitude and phase modes in K 0.3MoO 3.
With the exception of the lowest phase mode, the temperature dependence of the measured mode
energies can be quantitatively described within a multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich model for generic electron-
phonon interactions neglecting long-range Coulomb interactions.
I. INTRODUCTION
The charge-density-wave (CDW) state in quasi-
one-dimensional conductors such as K 0.3MoO 3(“blue
bronze”) has received a lot of attention in the 1970s and
1980s both theoretically [1–5] and experimentally [6–10].
At a critical temperature Tc, CDW-materials exhibit a
phase transition from a metallic to a semiconducting
state with a gap ∆ for electronic excitations with
momenta close to the Fermi momentum kF. The
CDW state can be associated with a Peierls distortion,
where phonons with momentum close to q= 2kF
condense and, thus, generate an additional periodic
potential for the electrons. The CDW gap ∆ is
proportional to the macroscopic phonon displacement
with momentum q= 2kF. In this work, we consider
only incommensurate charge-density-waves where 2 kF
lies (up to a reciprocal lattice vector) inside the first
Brillouin zone. The CDW order parameter is then
complex so that its fluctuations can be decomposed into
phase and amplitude fluctuations. The amplitude mode
is the analog of the Higgs mode in high-energy physics,
while the phase mode (phason) is the Goldstone mode
associated with the spontaneous breaking of the U(1)
symmetry of the complex CDW order parameter. The
phase mode is therefore expected to be gapless.
Recent progress in time resolved optical and THz
spectroscopy [11–17] has triggered renewed interest in
the dynamics of collective modes in CDW systems; note
in particular our companion paper [17]. However, a
complete theoretical understanding of their dynamics is
still not available. In particular, microscopic calculations
of the damping of phase and amplitude modes in the
CDW state as a function of temperature cannot be found
in the literature. In this work, we address another
relevant question which has not been completely settled:
what is the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions onthe spectrum of collective modes in an incommensurate
CDW? Old publications addressing this problem are
partially contradictory [18–20]. In particular, Virosztek
and Maki [20] found that the amplitude modes are
not affected by the Coulomb interaction, while the
phase mode splits at finite temperature into an optical
and an acoustic branch; at zero temperature ( T=
0K) only the optical branch survives so that Coulomb
interactions destroy gapless phase fluctuations. In this
work, we critically re-examine this result and show that
it is essentially modified when the Coulomb interaction
between the positively charged ions (which was neglected
in Ref. [20]) is taken into account. We find that in
the CDW state the lowest phase mode remains gapless
even in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions.
Our approach shows that the screening of the Coulomb
interaction by acoustic phonons (which is the Goldstone
mode implied by the broken translational invariance in a
crystal) is essential to protect the gapless nature of the
lowest-frequency phase mode.
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II
we introduce two model Hamiltonians describing
incommensurate charge-density-waves in quasi-one-
dimensional conductors: the multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich
Hamiltonian for generic electron-phonon interactions and
its extension including long-range Coulomb interactions.
In Sec. III we recapitulate the mean-field theory for
the CDW state. In the following Sec. IV we compute
the collective modes in the CDW state without long-
range Coulomb interactions using an effective action
approach for the generic Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian within
the Gaussian approximation (which is equivalent to the
random-phase approximation). In Sec. V we derive
the dispersions of collective modes including long-range
Coulomb interactions and show that the lowest-frequency
phase mode remains gapless. In Sec. VI we compare
our predictions for the temperature dependence of thearXiv:2303.08580v2  [cond-mat.str-el]  14 Aug 20232
collective modes with experimental results for K 0.3MoO 3
[14–17]. The concluding Sec. VII gives a summary of our
main results and an outlook. Additional technical details
of the calculations presented in this work are given in two
appendices.
II. MODELS
In this section, we introduce two model Hamiltonians
for the theoretical description of the CDW state in
quasi-one-dimensional conductors such as K 0.3MoO 3.
We also point out some subtleties related to phonon
renormalization and the screening of the Coulomb
interactions which play an important role in the
calculation of the collective modes in the CDW state.
A. Multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich model for generic
electron-phonon interactions
The established minimal model describing the CDW
instability in low-dimensional conductors is the Fr¨ ohlich
Hamiltonian for generic electron-phonon interactions [21]
HF=X

VX
kσqλγqλc†
k+qσckσXqλ, (2.1)
where ckσannihilates a spin- σelectron with momentum
kand energy ϵk, while bqλannihilates a phonon of type
λ, with momentum qand energy ωqλ. Note that the sum
overλruns over all types of longitudinal and transverse
phonons. Assuming that the Fermi surface can be
approximated by two parallel flat sheets (see for example
the experiments [22]) at ±kF=±kFex, where exis a
unit vector along the direction of the chains of atoms
or molecules forming the quasi-one-dimensional material,
the dispersion of the low-energy fermionic excitations can
be approximated by ϵkF+k≈ϵkF+vFkx, where vFis
the Fermi velocity. In the second line of Eq. (2.1) the
volume of the system is denoted by Vand the phonon
displacements are represented by the operator
Xqλ=bqλ+b†
−qλp2ωqλ. (2.2)
We assume that the electron-phonon couplings γqλare
only finite for momenta qclose to ±2kFso that, to the
leading order, long-wavelength phonons with |q| ≪kF
are not renormalized by the interaction. As pointed
out a long time ago in Refs. [23 and 24] and recently
emphasized in Ref. [25], a finite small-momentum part
of the vertex γqλin the generic Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian
(2.1) would lead to a lattice instability [21] which has
recently been discussed by several authors [26–34]. In
this work we eliminate possible instabilities competingwith the CDW by assuming that γqλis finite only for
the momenta qclose to ±2kF.
B. Fr¨ ohlich-Coulomb model
To take the long-range Coulomb interaction and
electron-phonon scattering with small momentum
transfers into account, we supplement the Fr¨ ohlich
Hamiltonian for generic electron-phonon interactions
(2.1) by the quantized interaction energy between all
charge fluctuations [35],
HFC=HF+1
2VX
q̸=0fqρ−qρq, (2.3)
where fqis the Fourier transform of the Coulomb
interaction. For a quasi-one-dimensional system of
coupled chains with transverse lattice spacing a⊥this
gives [36, 37]
fq=e2a2
⊥Z∞
−∞drxX
r⊥e−iq·r
p
r2x+r2
⊥, (2.4)
where the r⊥sum is over a two-dimensional lattice
of chains and the r⊥= 0 terms should be properly
regularized. In the long-wavelength limit |q|a⊥≪1 this
reduces to the usual fq= 4πe2/q2. The density operator
in Eq. (2.3),
ρq=ρe
q−ρi
q, (2.5)
represents the Fourier components of the total charge
density consisting of the sum of the electronic density
ρe
q=X

kσck+qσ, (2.6)
and the ionic density
ρi
q=−√
VX
λαqλXqλ. (2.7)
While the sum over λruns over all types of phonons
we set αqλ= 0 when λrefers to transverse phonons;
in contrast, the electron-phonon coupling γ±2kFλin
the Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian (2.1) is non-zero for both
longitudinal and transverse phonons. The coupling
between longitudinal phonons and the fluctuations of the
ionic density for small momenta is of the form [35, 38]
αqλ=αλ|q|, (2.8)
where the momentum-independent constants αλdepend
on the phonon type. In particular, a lattice with a single
atom per unit cell supports only one longitudinal acoustic
phonon, so that in this case, we may omit the flavor label
λ. The corresponding coupling αqin this case can be
written as [35]
αq=zrni
M|q|, (2.9)3
where zis the valence of the ions, niis their density, and
Mis their mass. Let us emphasize that the Coulomb

For acoustic phonons this is the usual deformation-
potential coupling to electrons with unscreened electron-
ion potential [35, 38]. For optical phonons the coupling
fqαq∝1/|q|describes the polar coupling of electrons to
longitudinal optical phonons [38].
The ion-ion interaction on the right-hand side of
Eq. (2.10) has been omitted in previous investigations
of the effect of Coulomb interactions on the collective
modes in CDW systems [19, 20]. We show here that
for the calculation of the dispersions of the collective
modes of CDW systems in the presence of Coulomb
interactions, it is crucial to retain also the ion-ion
interaction term in Eq. (2.10). To give an intuitive
argument for the importance of the ion-ion interaction
one can consider, for simplicity, a lattice supporting
only a single longitudinal acoustic phonon. Then the
contribution from the ion-ion interaction to Eq. (2.10)
can be written as
1
2VX

iX−qXq, (2.12)
where we have used the fact that the combination
fqα2
q= Ω2
i= 4π(ze)2ni/M (2.13)
can be identified with the square of the ionic plasma
frequency. At the first glance, Eq. (2.12) seems to
suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions push the
frequency of acoustic phonons up to the ionic plasma
frequency. In a metal this is of course incorrect,
because the ionic charge is screened by the electrons
so that acoustic phonons have the squared dispersion
Ω2
i/(1 +κ2/q2), where κis the Thomas-Fermi screening
wavevector. For q≪κwe thus recover the linear
dispersion of acoustic phonons with velocity Ω i/κ, which
is the well-known Bohm-Staver relation [39, 40]. From
the above considerations, it should be clear that by
simply dropping the ionic contribution to the Coulomb
interaction in Eq. (2.10) one violates the balance between
electronic and ionic charge fluctuations and therefore
cannot properly describe screening effects. To calculate
the effect of Coulomb interactions on the collective modes
                                                                              electrons

Coulomb interaction between the ions. The full lines marked
“electrons” and “ions” are the profiles of the electronic and
the ionic densities in the CDW state respectively. The dashed
line is the electronic density profile for the phase mode, in
which its phase acquires a shift with respect to the lowest
energy state. The plus and minus charges mark formation of
a macroscopic dipole in the system when the phase mode is
excited, see also chapter 6 of Ref. [41].
in CDW systems it is, therefore, crucial to retain also the
ionic contribution to the Coulomb Hamiltonian (2.10).
In Sec. V we will calculate the energies of amplitude and
phase modes including the effect of Coulomb interactions.
There we find that the ionic part in Eq. (2.10) leads
to a new contribution to the collective modes energies
which can have the same order of magnitude as the
result obtained in Ref. [20] where the purely ionic part in
Eq. (2.10) was neglected. It turns out that this ionic part
is crucial to describe the complete screening of electronic
charge fluctuations by the ions, which in turn protects the
gapless nature of the Goldstone mode associated with the
broken U(1) symmetry in the CDW state.
This effect of the ionic part on the formation of
Goldstone (phase) mode can be understood intuitively
on the physical level as follows. The CDW state is
formed due to the Peiels instability, i.e., the electrons
and ions form a wave state in their respective densities
at a given momentum with the relative phase shift of πso
that the net charge remains zero everywhere throughout
the system, as illustrated by the two solid lines in Fig.
1. An excitation of the phase type above this state is
a deviation in the phase of the electronic density profile,
see the dashed line in Fig. 1, that produces a macroscopic
dipole moment, which costs a finite charging energy since
the Coulomb force is long-range and results in a finite
gap in the spectrum of the phase excitations. Turning
on the Coulomb interaction between the ions allows the
screening processes for electrons by the ions. Such a
process is also invoked in the intuitive derivation of the
Bohm-Staver relation [39, 40]. Such processes also allow
the ionic density profile to follow the electron one in
Fig. 1 resulting in absence of any macroscopic dipole
and eliminating, therefore, the gap in the spectrum fo
the phase mode. In a different context, the importance
of the ion-ion contribution has been noted previously in4
Refs. [42 and 43].
III. MEAN-FIELD THEORY FOR THE CDW
To fix our notation and set the stage for the calculation
of the collective modes, let us briefly recall the usual
mean-field theory for the CDW state in a quasi-
one-dimensional metal [7] within a functional integral
approach. Starting point is the Euclidean action of the

coupling and Π 0(q,0) is the static Lindhard function in one

diverges logarithmically for T→0, there is a finite critical
temperature Tcwhere ˜ ω2kFvanishes. At lower temperatures
a CDW with periodicity Q∗= 2kFemerges.
This is the action of non-interacting electrons moving

states and the spectrum consists of infinitely many energy
bands Ekn, where kis restricted to the first Brillouin

the first Brillouin zone is |kx| ≤kF. Since we are only
interested in the low-energy states we retain only the
lowest two energy bands by restricting the momentum
sum to the regime |kx| ≤2kFconsisting of the first two
Brillouin zones. After shifting the momentum labels in

the phason velocity is smaller than the Fermi velocity.

where ∆ is exponentially small, the approximation vφ≈

V. EFFECT OF LONG-RANGE COULOMB

[20], in the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction an
incommensurate CDW at zero temperature does not have
a gapless collective mode related to the breaking of the
U(1)-symmetry of the complex CDW order parameter
atT= 0. This is rather surprising, because it
means that the Coulomb interaction completely destroys
the Goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous
breaking of the U(1)-symmetry of the complex order-
parameter of the incommensurate CDW. We show in this
section that this result is erroneous and that the phase
mode remains gapless even in the presence of Coulomb
interactions. The crucial point is that the charge
fluctuations associated with long-wavelength acoustic
phonons screen the long-range Coulomb interaction even
at zero temperature so that the resulting effective
interaction is short-range and cannot qualitatively
modify the gapless phase mode. This screening effect
was not properly taken into account in Ref. [20].
Starting point of our investigation is the Hamiltonian
HFCgiven in Eq. (2.3) which is obtained by adding the
quantized Coulomb energy of electronic and ionic charge
fluctuations to the Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian for generic
electron-phonon interactions (2.1). After integrating
the corresponding Euclidean action over the phonon
momenta and decoupling the Coulomb interaction
employing a Hubbard-Stratonovich field ϕwe obtain
the following Euclidean action of our Fr¨ ohlich-Coulombmodel,

In the last line the term iR
Qϕ−QP
λαqλXQλdescribes
the contribution of ionic charge fluctuations to the
effective interaction. It turns out that this term, which
has been ignored by Virosztek and Maki [20], is essential
to correctly describe the effect of Coulomb interactions
on the phase modes in a CDW.
Note that pure Coulomb interactions in one-
dimensional electronic systems are generally non-
perturbative already at low energies due to the Luttinger-
liquid physics [48] dominated by the gapless CDW states,
and a growing body of evidence indicates that the
formation of CDWs in these systems is more generic
then the low-energy phenomenon [49, 50]. Nevertheless,
the use of only the Gaussian approximation is justified
in our calculation by the effect of the electron-phonon
interaction which triggers the formation of the gapful
correlated CDW state via the Peierls instability. At low
temperatures the inverse of the large value of the order
parameter ∆ in Eq. (3.22) provides a small parameter
for the perturbative treatment of the electron-electron
interaction even in one dimension in this work. Also some
numerical studies of the interplay between Luttinger
liquids and the Peierls instability in [51, 52] suggest a
possibility of such a scenario. We will return to this
point later in Sec. VI where we compare the results of
this section with the experimental data.
Following the procedure outlined in Sec. IV we
may now integrate over the fermions in the two-band
approximation to obtain the effective action of the
phonons and the Coulomb field,

hand, the Coulomb interaction gives rise to an additional
contribution ΠBB
1(Q) to the polarization function of the

can be identified with the long-wavelength dielectric

To derive the dispersions of the long-wavelength phase

On the other hand, in the opposite limit vs|qx| ≫Ωi/√ϵr
the plasmon oscillates with the frequency vs|qx|, i.e.
in this regime the plasmon can be identified with the

Due to the coupling of the phase mode to the Coulomb
field in the CDW state, the plasma oscillations hybridize
with the phase modes. The energy dispersions of the
hybrid modes can be obtained from the zeros of the
inverse propagator of the phase modes in our effective

ω−(qx)∼˜vφ|qx|, (5.25)
with the renormalized phase velocity ˜ vφgiven by
˜vφ=q
xev2s+xiv2φ. (5.26)
Thus, in the presence of Coulomb interactions the
velocity ˜ vφof the gapless phase mode is a weighted
average of the phonon velocity and the phason
velocity without Coulomb interactions; the weights are
determined by the ratio of the ionic and electronic plasma
frequencies. In the adiabatic limit, where the mass Mof
the ions is much larger than the mass mof the electrons
and the ionic plasma frequency is small compared with
the electronic plasma frequency, we can approximate the
weights as xe≈1 and xi≈˜Ω2

Assuming in addition a weak electron-phonon coupling,
i.e.,vφ≈vF, we find that Eq. (5.26) reduces to

The Bohm-Staver relation [39, 40] allows us to express
the sound velocity in terms of the Fermi velocity

which is justified because by definition vsis the bare
sound velocity in the normal state of our model. Using
the Bohm-Staver relation we obtain in the adiabatic
regime and for weak electron-phonon coupling
˜vφ=r
4zm
3MvF= 2vs. (5.29)
We conclude that in this regime long-range Coulomb
interactions can strongly renormalize the phason velocity
in the ground state of a quasi one-dimensional CDW, as
illustrated in the lower panel of Fig. 6: While vφ≈vF
in the absence of Coulomb interactions, the inclusion of
Coulomb interactions generates a strong renormalization
of the phase velocity to a value of the order of the sound
velocity vs.
Finally, consider the regime of intermediate to strong
electron-phonon coupling where vφ≪vs≪vF. In
this regime, the coupling constant g1in Eq. (4.43) is
small compared with unity so that vφ≪vFin the
absence of Coulomb interactions. The renormalized value
˜vφof the phase velocity then has the same order of
magnitude as the phase velocity vφwithout Coulomb
interactions because the factors xiandxein Eq. (5.26)
have the same order of magnitude. The dispersions of
the collective modes in this regime are illustrated in
Fig. 7. We emphasize that the gapless nature of the phase
mode in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions
is protected by the existence of a longitudinal acoustic
phonon in a crystal. This is an interesting example for
the interplay of two Goldstone modes associated with the
breaking of two different continuous symmetries, U(1)-
symmetry of the CDW order parameter and translational
symmetry of free space in a crystal.

In this section, we fit the free parameters of our
two model Hamiltonians (with and without Coulomb
interactions) using the temperature dependence of the
lowest three amplitude and phase modes of K 0.3MoO 3
over a wide temperature range. Then, we show that the
predictions of our calculations for the amplitude modes
fit the available experimental data [14–17] remarkably
well. However, for the phase modes, both models
describe the experimental data given in Refs. [16 and
17] only qualitatively. We, therefore, discuss the
shortcomings of our theoretical description of K 0.3MoO 3
and possible improvements to achieve a qualitatively
accurate modeling of the experiments.
A. K 0.3MoO 3and the multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich model
for generic electron-phonon interactions
The multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian HFdefined
in Eq. (2.1) with λmaxphonons depends on 2 λmaxfree
parameters: The phonon frequencies ω2kFλand the
electron-phonon couplings γ2kFλ. In principle, these
parameters can be determined by measuring the energies
of the λmaxamplitude modes and the associated λmax
phase modes at some fixed momentum q. Unfortunately,
such a measurement is not available at this point, since
the experiments [14–17] lack momentum resolution.
Moreover, in contrast to our results for the amplitude
modes, our experimental data for the phase modes
exhibit an unexplained temperature dependence and
no mode at zero frequency which prevents us from
fitting our theoretical results to the raw data for the
2λmax collective modes. Instead, we fix the 2 λmax
free parameters of our multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich model
using the frequencies ωλ≡ω2kFλof the bare phonon
modes from a measurement at T > T cand fitting the
measured amplitude modes at T= 0, which can then
be used to fix the squared electron-phonon couplings
γ2
λ. Remarkably, if we neglect the Coulomb interaction
none of the subsequent findings are sensitive to the
precise value of the gap ∆ 0≡∆(T= 0) even though
∆0is an additional free parameter. This is because the
solutions to the mode equations (4.31) and (4.32) are
of the order of the phonon frequencies ω2kFλ, which
means that our calculation of the mode energies is not
only controlled by the dimensionless electron-phonon
couplings g0,λ=γ2
λν3/2ω2
2kFλ, but also by the small
parameter ω/2∆0∼ω2kFλ/2∆0. Hence, the auxiliary
function F(0, ω) in Eq. (4.28) can be evaluated for small
ωand, therefore, all corrections which explicitly depend
on ∆ 0are at least of order ω2/2∆2
0≪1.
In this work, we retain only the lowest three phase and
amplitude modes of K 0.3MoO 3. The frequencies of bare
phonon modes for T > T care taken from Refs. [14–16],

from angle-resolved photoemission measurements [54],
which fixes all the electron-phonon couplings γ2

three relevant phonon modes. The numerical values of
our fit parameters ωλandγ2
λare given in Appendix B.
Then we solve the mean-field gap equation (3.18) to
obtain the temperature-dependent gap ∆( T). Cross-
checking with Refs. [46, 55] reveals that ∆( T) can be
approximated on the mean-field level. Using ∆( T) as an
input for the numerical solution of the function F(0, ω)
defined in Eq. (4.29) enables us to solve for the roots of
the mode-frequency equations (4.31) and (4.32) in the
absence of Coulomb interactions for ΠAA(ω+iδ,0) and
ΠBB(ω+iδ,0). Our results are presented in Figs. 8
and 9, where we plot the lowest three temperature-
dependent amplitude and phase modes for temperatures
up to T <0.98Tc. The experimental data were taken in
Refs. [14–17, 57]. The black dots in Figs. 8 and 9 are a a
recently re-analyzed version of the data [17].
From Fig. 8, we see that our calculations reproduce
quantitatively the temperature dependence of the
amplitude-mode frequencies from Refs. [14–17] as long
asTis not too close to Tc. When the temperature
approaches Tcthermal fluctuations become increasingly
important and the order parameter ∆( T) becomes small
so that the Gaussian approximation used in this work
is expected to break down. In this regime higher-
order processes need to be taken into account, like for
example in the theory of fluctuational superconductivity
for temperatures close to Tc[56].
In Fig. 9 we compare our theoretical predictions for
the energies of the phase modes with the experiments.
Although for the finite-frequency modes the order of
magnitudes agree with [16, 17], our Eq. (4.32) predicts

that the lowest phase mode should be gapless, in contrast
to the experimental data [57] for the lowest phase mode
which exhibit a small but finite gap. Moreover, our
finite-temperature results for the phase modes reveal
a discrepancy in the magnitude of the temperature
dependence: Our solution of Eq. (4.32) predicts a
variation in the temperature dependence of the finite-
frequency phase modes of order 10−4THz which looks
essentially flat on the scale of Fig. 9. By contrast, the
experimentally observed variation, while being generally
weak compared to the phase mode frequencies, is still
two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical
estimate, i.e., of order 10−2THz for the finite frequency15
phase modes shown in Fig. 9. A possible explanation
for this discrepancy between our theory for the finite
frequency phase modes and experiment is that the
Gaussian approximation made in deriving Eq. (4.32) is
not sufficient to explain the temperature dependence of
the phase modes. Note that the Gaussian approximation,
which is equivalent to the random-phase approximation,
retains only the lowest order in the electron-phonon
coupling by including only the contribution of a single
electron-bubble to the phonon self-energy, i.e. it is
quadratic in the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling√g0defined in Eq. (4.46). To this order, there is no
mixing between the amplitude and phase modes, see
Eq. (4.26). However, the next-order contribution in
the collective fields, which is quartic in√g0, already
introduces such a mixing that would lead to a stronger
temperature variation of the phase modes. Since in
K0.3MoO 3the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling
g0∼0.3 is small, the effect of such mixing can
be estimated as g2
0δωA∼0.01 THz, where we used
δωA∼0.1 THz as the variation of the higher frequency
amplitude modes in Fig. 8. This estimate matches the
experimentally observed order of magnitude of the phase
mode variation. Hence, a systematic calculation of this
effect for the phase modes can be done by considering
higher order terms up to the fourth order of the expansion
(4.5), posing a route for further improving the accuracy
of the theory presented in this work.
While the experimental data for the amplitude modes
and the order of magnitude for the higher-frequency
phase modes can be fitted by our results for the multi-
phonon Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian for generic electron-phonon
interactions, the behavior of the lowest phase mode
remains somewhat mysterious. In fact, in experiments
the frequency of this mode has not been unambiguously
determined so far; for example, with the detectors
used in Ref. [16, 17] any mode with frequency of the
order of 1 THz or lower cannot be reliably detected
leading to a difference in the analyses between Ref. [16]
and Ref. [17]. Given the fact that according to our
analysis the lowest phase mode remains gapless even
in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, the
physical mechanism inducing a gap in the lowest phase
mode, seen in an earlier experiment by Degiorgi et
al.[57], remains unclear. One possible explanation is
pinning by impurities [58], which are not included in our
model. Another possibility is that the gapped lowest-
frequency phase mode detected in the experimental data
reproduced in Fig. 9 is actually the upper (gapful) branch
of the hybrid phason-plasmon mode due to the Coulomb
interaction discussed in Sec. V.
B. K 0.3MoO 3and the Fr¨ ohlich-Coulomb model
To examine the hypothesis that the lowest phase mode
is the upper (gapful) branch of the hybrid phason-
plasmon mode induced by the Coulomb interaction,we have solved the equation (5.17) for the collective
phase modes including the effect of long-range Coulomb
interactions. The collective modes now depend on
additional parameters, which can be chosen to be the
electronic plasma frequency Ω2
e= 4πe2n/m and the
long-wavelength electron-phonon couplings αqλ=αλ|q|
defined in Eq. (2.8). For simplicity, we work here
with a minimal model where the fluctuations of the
ionic density are described by a single acoustic phonon,
i.e., neglecting hybridization with the other phonons.
Therefore, we can conveniently use the square of the
ionic plasma frequency fqα2
q= Ω2
ias the additional (and
experimentally accessible) fit parameter instead of the
coupling αq. With Ω e≈0.1 eV and Ω2
i/Ω2
e≈1/2000
we obtain the hybrid phason-plasmon mode indicated by
the gray line in Fig. 10. At the same time, the amplitude
modes are not affected by the Coulomb interaction within
our approximation and the finite frequency phase modes
are marginally shifted by the self-energy correction (5.5)
due to Coulomb interactions.
While the frequency ω+(0) of the hybrid phason-
plasmon mode (depicted by the gray line in Fig. 10)
is of a reasonable magnitude and behaves as all the
other regular amplitude/phase modes for low enough
temperatures, the theoretically predicted dramatic
temperature dependence at higher temperatures
disagrees with the experiments [16, 17]. For T
exceeding a certain temperature T∗(which we estimate
in Appendix B) the temperature dependence of our
theoretical expression for ω+(0), shown in Fig. 10,
is due to a strongly T-dependent contribution to the
polarization function Πϕϕ
0(Q) defined in Eq. (B4). This
contribution, which vanishes for T→0, restores to the
usual Lindhard function [35, 44] in the normal metallic
state and dominates the temperature dependence of
the hybrid mode for T≳T∗. This contribution was
already taken into account in the calculations including
long-range Coulomb interactions by Visosztek and Maki
[20], yet because they neglect the ionic response it plays
a different role there.
One possible explanation for the above discrepancy
between theory and experiment is the breakdown of
the Gaussian approximation (which is equivalent to
the random-phase approximation) to properly describe
the formation of charge-density waves in the presence
of Coulomb interactions for T≳T∗. Since
Luttinger liquid physics is generally expected to become
important in electronically one-dimensional systems
with Coulomb interaction [48], higher-order interaction
processes neglected in Gaussian approximation are
expected to stabilize the CDW state [59–61] in the
temperature range T≳T∗, and suppress the Fermi liquid
physics including metallic screening described by the
temperature dependence of polarization function Πϕϕ
0(Q)
forT≳T∗. We therefore suggest that the proper
theory of collective modes in the presence of long-range
Coulomb interactions for T > T ∗would need to include
interactions between the collective modes, which is a16

the scope of the present work.
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have re-examined the effect of long-
range Coulomb interactions on the collective amplitude
and phase modes in an electronically one-dimensional
incommensurate CDW. We have shown that the lowest
phase mode has a gapless linear dispersion even in
the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. Our
calculation reveals the crucial role of the longitudinal
acoustic phonon to protect the gapless nature of the
lowest phase mode in the presence of long-range Coulomb
interactions. This is an interesting example of the
interplay of two Goldstone modes associated with
the spontaneous breaking of two different continuous
symmetries in a solid. Previous investigations of
this problem [19, 20] have not properly taken the
fluctuations of the ionic charge density and the associated
contribution to the dielectric function into account. Let
us emphasize that a correct description of screening is
crucial to calculate the collective modes in a CDW:
Although the electronic contribution to the dielectric
function is finite due to the CDW gap, the ionic
contribution associated with the last term in our
expression (5.7) for the dielectric function restores the
usual 1 /q2divergence of the static dielectric functiondue to the contribution from the acoustic phonon. As
a result, the Coulomb interaction is effectively screened
and the phase mode remains gapless. If we incorrectly
omit the contribution of the acoustic phonon in the sumP
λα2
qλ/(ν2+ω2
qλ) in Eq. (5.7) this contribution would
vanish as q2for small qleading to a finite static dielectric
function; the Coulomb interaction would then remain
long-range leading to a gapped phase mode.
Comparison with experiments on K 0.3MoO 3(blue
bronze) [14–17] shows that the temperature-dependent
mode frequencies of multiple amplitude modes are
already well described by the multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich
Hamiltonian for generic electron-phonon interactions
in Gaussian approximation derived in Sec. IV. At
this level of approximation, our effective action
approach is essentially equivalent to the random-phase
approximation adopted long time ago by Lee, Rice, and
Anderson [1–5]. While this model is fairly successful
in describing the order of magnitude for the higher
frequency phase modes, our calculations for the multi-
phonon Fr¨ ohlich model for generic electron-phonon
interactions (2.1) and its generalization (2.3) including
the long-range Coulomb interaction fail to ascertain the
nature of the lowest phase mode detected in Ref. [16,
17 and 57] and exhibit a temperature dependence far
beneath the experimental values. At this point, we can
only speculate about the nature of the experimentally
observed lowest finite frequency phase mode and if a
stabilized version of the T= 0 phason-plasmon hybrid
mode predicted by Eq. (5.4) exists. We note however,
that pinning by impurities would raise the zero-frequency
phase mode to finite frequencies.
Finally, let us point out that the experimental data [14–
17] for the amplitude modes and the phase modes exhibit
a finite broadening. Unfortunately, at the level of the
Gaussian approximation, the collective modes predicted
by Eq. (4.26) or Eq. (5.4) have infinite lifetime and
hence do not exhibit any broadening. To compute the
damping of the collective modes within our effective
action approach one has to go beyond the Gaussian
approximation, retaining in an expansion in powers of
the electron-phonon coupling g0terms up to order g3
0
for the amplitude- and up to order g4
0for the phase
modes [62, 63]. An alternative method of calculating the
damping of the collective modes based on the solution of
kinetic equations will be presented in Ref. [64].

APPENDIX B: FIT PARAMETERS
In this appendix we specify the parameters in the
multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian for generic electron-
phonon interactions(2.1) and in the Fr¨ ohlich-Coulomb
Hamiltonian (2.3) which we have used in Sec. VI to
compare our calculations with the experimental data.
The multi-phonon Fr¨ ohlich Hamiltonian for generic
electron-phonon interactions (2.1) with λmaxphonons
depends on the bare phonon frequencies ω2kFλand
the electron-phonon couplings γλ, which form a set of
2λmaxparameters. In addition, out Hamiltonian depends
also on the ultraviolet cutoff ωcin the mean-field gap
equation (3.19); actually, we may use the gap equation
(3.19) to eliminate ωcin favor of the experimentally
measured zero-temperature gap 2∆( T= 0)≈100 meV ≈

At zero temperature Eq. (B4) collapses to Eq. (5.8).
On the other hand, at the critical temperature where
∆(Tc) = 0 the first term involving the derivative of
the Fermi function reduces to the usual high-frequency
behavior of the Lindhard function in the limit vFq≪ω,
whereas the second term vanishes. The crossover scale T∗
can be estimated from the condition that the first term
on the right-hand side of Eq. (B4) has the same order
of magnitude as the sum of the second term and theionic screening Eq. (B2). In terms of the dimensionless
