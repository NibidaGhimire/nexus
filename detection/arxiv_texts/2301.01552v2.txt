1.Introduction
Summary. Recall that a monogenic order is an order of the shape
Z[α], whereαis an algebraic integer. This is generalized to orders
Zαfor not necessarily integral algebraic numbers αas follows. For an
algebraic number αof degree n, letMαbe theZ-module generated
by1,α,...,αn−1; thenZα:={ξ∈Q(α) :ξMα⊆ Mα}is the ring of
scalars of Mα. We call an order of the shape Zαrationally monogenic .
Ifαis an algebraic integer, then Zα=Z[α]is monogenic. Rationally
monogenic orders are invariant rings of primitive polynomi als or binary
forms, see, e.g., [5], [15], [16], [17], [6], [19], [10, Chap . 16]. Ifα,βare two
GL2(Z)-equivalent algebraic numbers, i.e., β=aα+b
cα+dfor some/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈
GL2(Z), thenZα=Zβ. Given an order Oof a number ﬁeld, we call a
GL2(Z)-equivalence class of αwithZα=Oarational monogenization
ofO.
We prove the following. If Kis a quartic number ﬁeld, then Khas
only ﬁnitely many orders with more than two rational monogen izations.
This is best possible. Further, if Kis a number ﬁeld of degree ≥5,
the Galois group of whose normal closure is 5-transitive, then Khas
only ﬁnitely many orders with more than one rational monogen ization.
The proof uses ﬁniteness results for unit equations, which i n turn were
derived from Schmidt’s Subspace Theorem. Except for the hyp othesis
on the normal closure of K, our result implies a conjecture posed in
[4].
We generalize the above results to rationally monogenic ord ers over
rings ofS-integers of number ﬁelds. Our results extend work of Bércze s,
Győry and the author [2] on monogenic orders.
Background and results. LetKbe a number ﬁeld. Denote its
ring of integers by OK. An order OofK(i.e., a subring of Kthat
as aZ-module is free of rank [K:Q]) is called monogenic if there is
α∈ OwithO=Z[α]. The set of αwithZ[α] =Ocan be divided into
so-called Z-equivalence classes, where α1,α2are called Z-equivalent if
α1−α2∈Zorα1+α2∈Z. AZ-equivalence class of αwithZ[α] =Ois
called a monogenization ofO. Every order of a quadratic number ﬁeld
has precisely one monogenization. Orders of number ﬁelds of degree
≥3may be non-monogenic or have more than one monogenization.
From work of Győry [12], [13] it can be deduced, and in fact in a nORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 3
eﬀective form, that if Kis any number ﬁeld of degree ≥3then every
orderOofKhas at most ﬁnitely many monogenizations. If one keeps
the number ﬁeld Kﬁxed and restricts to monogenic orders of K, then
most of these have only few monogenizations. Bérczes, Győry and the
author [2, Theorem 1.1] obtained the following result.
Theorem A. LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree ≥3. ThenKhas only
ﬁnitely many orders with more than two monogenizations.
This result is optimal. For instance, if εis a unit of OKwithQ(ε) =
K, thenZ[ε] =Z[ε−1], whileεandε−1are notZ-equivalent. More
generally, let α∈ OKbe such that Q(α) =K, suppose there are
integersc,dsuch that cα+dis a unit of OK, leta,bbe integers such
that/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈GL2(Z), and put β:=aα+b
cα+d. ThenZ[α] =Z[β], whileα
andβare notZ-equivalent.
This suggests that it is natural to consider GL2(Z)-equivalence classes
ofαwithZ[α] =O. Here,α,β∈Kare called GL2(Z)-equivalent if
there is/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈GL2(Z)such that β=aα+b
cα+d.
We say that a group Gactst-transitively on a ﬁnite set Sif for
any pairwise distinct i1,...,i t∈ Sand pairwise distinct j1,...,j t∈ S,
there isσ∈Gsuch that σ(i1) =j1,...,σ(it) =jt. IfK=Q(α)and
Lis the normal closure of K, we say that Gal(L/Q)ist-transitive if it
actst-transitively on the set of conjugates {α(1),...,α(n)}ofα.
Then from [2, Theorems 1.1 and 1.2(ii)], the following can be de-
duced:
Theorem B. LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree ≥5such that the Galois
group of its normal closure is 4-transitive. Then for all orders OofK
with at most ﬁnitely many exceptions, the set of αwithZ[α] =Ois
contained in at most one GL2(Z)-equivalence class.
It is not known whether the condition on the normal closure of K
is necessary. It can be proved in an elementary way that if Kis a
cubic number ﬁeld and Oan order of K, then the set of α∈ Owith
Z[α] =Ois contained in at most one GL2(Z)-equivalence class. For
quartic number ﬁelds K, the above theorem is false. In fact, [2, end of
Section 1] gives the following construction:
Theorem C. Letr,sbe integers such that f(X) = (X2−r)2−X−s
is irreducible, and let K=Q(α), whereαis a root of f. ThenKhas4 J.-H. EVERTSE
inﬁnitely many orders Om(m= 1,2,...) with the following property:
Om=Z[αm] =Z[βm], whereβm=α2
m−rm,αm=β2
m−smfor some
integersrm,sm.
It is clear that αm,βmin the above theorem are not GL2(Z)-equivalent.
Our aim is to generalize Theorem B to orders attached to non-
integral algebraic numbers. Let αbe an algebraic number of degree
nandfα∈Z[X]its primitive minimal polynomial, i.e., with coeﬃ-
cients having gcd 1. Then the order Zαattached to αis the invariant
ring or order of fα, see Nakagawa [15], Simon [16] or [5], [17], [6], [19],
[10, Chap. 16]. Nakagawa and Simon deﬁned this order by givin g a
Z-module basis for it, together with a multiplication table. A direct
deﬁnition of Zαis as follows. Deﬁne the Z-module
(1.1) Mα:=/braceleftbig
x0+x1α+···+xn−1αn−1:x0,...,x n−1∈Z}.
ThenZαis the ring of scalars of Mα, i.e.,
(1.2) Zα:={ξ∈Q(α) :ξMα⊆ Mα}.
Ifαis an algebraic integer, then αi∈ Mαfori≥n, and thus, Zα=
Mα=Z[α]. Further, if α,βareGL2(Z)-equivalent, i.e., β=aα+b
cα+dfor
some/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈GL2(Z), then one easily veriﬁes that Mβ=
(cα+d)1−nMα, which implies Zβ=Zα.
To simplify the formulation of our results, we introduce the following
terminology. We call an order Oof a number ﬁeld Krationally mono-
genic ifO=Zαfor some αwithK=Q(α). AGL2(Z)-equivalence
class ofαwithZα=Ois called a rational monogenization ofO.
We give some other descriptions for Zα. Let again αbe an algebraic
number of degree n, and denote by fαits primitive minimal polynomial,
i.e.,fα=a0Xn+···+an∈Z[X]witha0>0andgcd(a0,...,a n) = 1.
ThenZαis theZ-module with basis
(1.3)1,ω1,...,ω n−1, ωi=a0αi+a1αi−1+···ai−1α(i= 1,...,n−1)
(see [10, p. 365, Thm. 16.2.9, formula (16.2.7)] or Lemma 2.1 in the
present paper). This is precisely the invariant order of fαas deﬁned by
Nakagawa [15] and Simon [16]. Del Corso, Dvornicich and Simo n [6,
Prop. 2] (see also Lemma 2.1 in the present paper) proved the m uch
simpler expression
Zα=Z[α]∩Z[α−1].ORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 5
From the basis (1.3) one deduces that the discriminant of the orderZα
is equal to the discriminant of fα, i.e.,
D(Zα) =DQ(α)/Q(1,ω1,...,ω n−1) (1.4)
=a2n−2
0DQ(α)/Q(1,α,...,αn−1)
=a2n−2
0/productdisplay
1≤i<j≤n(α(i)−α(j))2=D(fα),
whereα(1),...,α(n)are the conjugates of α.
The orders Zαare part of a much more general theory on invariant
rings of binary forms, see [15], [17], [6], [19], [10, Chap. 1 6]. We brieﬂy
comment on this at the end of this section.
It follows from the work of Birch and Merriman [5] on binary fo rms
that an order of a number ﬁeld has at most ﬁnitely many rationa l
monogenizations. Győry and the author [8, Cor. 2] proved tha t every
algebraic number αof degree nisGL2(Z)-equivalent to an algebraic
numberα∗with height H(α∗)≤C(n,D), whereH(α∗)is the maximum
of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of fα∗,Dis the discriminant
offα, andC(n,D)is eﬀectively computable. Together with (1.4) this
implies that it can be decided eﬀectively whether a given ord er of a
number ﬁeld has rational monogenizations and that these can be de-
termined eﬀectively.
It can be shown that a rationally monogenic order Oof a number
ﬁeld of degree ≥3isprimitive , i.e., there are no order O′and integer
a >1such that O=Z+aO′. It follows from classical work of Delone
and Faddeev [7] that every primitive order of a cubic number ﬁ eld
has precisely one rational monogenization. Further, work o f Bérczes,
Győry and the author [1] implies that an order of a number ﬁeld of
degreen≥4cannot have more than n·224n3rational monogenizations.
Győry and the author [10, Chap. 17] improved this to 25n2. From recent
work of Bhargava [3] it follows that for quartic orders this b ound can
be improved to 40.
We are now ready to state the main result of this paper, which g ives a
generalization of Theorem B to not necessarily integral alg ebraic num-
bersα.
Theorem 1.1. (i) LetKbe a quartic number ﬁeld. Then Khas only
ﬁnitely many orders with more than two rational monogenizat ions.6 J.-H. EVERTSE
(ii) LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree ≥5and suppose that the Galois
group of its normal closure is 5-transitive. Then Khas only ﬁnitely
many orders with more than one rational monogenization.
Theorem C implies that there are quartic number ﬁelds, havin g in-
ﬁnitely many orders with two rational monogenizations. We d o not
know whether the condition on the normal closure of Kis necessary if
[K:Q]≥5. Probably, trying to remove or relax this condition would
considerably complicate the proof.
The proof of Theorem 1.1 uses among other things ﬁniteness re sults
for unit equations in more than two unknowns. The present pro ofs of
these depend on ineﬀective methods from Diophantine approx imation,
e.g., Schmidt’s Subspace Theorem or the Faltings-Rémond me thod. As
a consequence, our proof of Theorem 1.1 is ineﬀective in that it does not
allow to determine the exceptional orders. Further, althou gh for unit
equations we have good upper bounds for the number of solutio ns, it
is because of the ‘other things,’ that we cannot give an upper bound
for the number of exceptional orders.
We state a consequence, which partly conﬁrms Conjecture 4.2 in [4].
We adopt the terminology of [4]. Given a number ﬁeld K, denote by
PI(K)the set of primitive, irreducible polynomials f∈Z[X], such
that there is αwithf(α) = 0 andQ(α) =K. We call two polynomials
f,g∈ PI(K) GL2(Z)-equivalent if there is/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈GL2(Z)such that
g(X) =±(cX+d)degff/parenleftbigaX+b
cX+d/parenrightbig
. Further, fandgare called Hermite
equivalent if there are α,βsuch that Q(α) =Q(β) =K,f(α) = 0 ,
g(β) = 0 andMβ=λMαfor some λ∈K∗(see (1.1) above). It
was shown in [4] that two GL2(Z)-equivalent polynomials are Hermite
equivalent. As we will show, Theorem 1.1 implies the followi ng, which
except for the assumption on the normal closure of Kis Conjecture 4.2
of [4].
Theorem 1.2. (i) LetKbe a quartic number ﬁeld. Then there are only
ﬁnitely many Hermite equivalence classes in PI(K)that fall apart into
more than two GL2(Z)-equivalence classes.
(ii) LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree ≥5, such that the Galois group
of its normal closure is 5-transitive. Then there are only ﬁnitely many
Hermite equivalence classes in PI(K)that fall apart into more than
oneGL2(Z)-equivalence class.ORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 7
Another consequence of our investigations, which probably could be
proved by other means as well, is the following.
Theorem 1.3. LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree ≥3. ThenKhas
inﬁnitely many orders that are rationally monogenic but not monogenic.
Finally, we would like to comment on the connection between t he
ordersZαdeﬁned above, and invariant orders of binary forms. Birch
and Merriman [5] introduced for a binary form
F(X,Y) =a0Xn+a1Xn−1Y+···+anYn∈Z[X,Y]
that is irreducible over QtheZ-moduleZFwithZ-basis1,ω1,...,ω n−1
given by (1.3), where F(α,1) = 0 . Nakagawa [15] proved that ZFis an
order of the number ﬁeld Q(α), in fact,
(1.5) ωiωj=−/summationdisplay
max(i+j−n,1)≤k≤iai+j−kωk+/summationdisplay
j<k≤min(i+j,n)ai+j−kωk
fori,j= 1,...,n−1, whereωn:=−an. Thus,ZFis called the invariant
ring or order of F. This order was further studied by Simon [16, 17]
and Del Corso, Dvornicich and Simon [6].
Notice that in the deﬁnition of ZFwe did not require that the coef-
ﬁcients of Fhave greatest common divisor 1. Our order Zαis justZF
whereF(X,Y) =Ydegαfα(X/Y)is an irreducible binary form whose
coeﬃcients have greatest common divisor 1.
More generally, given any commutative ring Rand binary form F=/summationtextn
i=0aiXn−iYi∈R[X,Y], one can formally deﬁne the invariant ring
RFofFby taking the free R-module with basis 1,ω1,...,ω n−1with
prescribed multiplication table (1.5). Here, it is no longe r required that
Fis irreducible, nor even that a0/\e}atio\slash= 0, and even a0=···=an= 0is
allowed. Wood [19] studied invariant rings of binary forms i n a much
broader context.
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In Sectio n 2 we
have collected some basic properties of rationally monogen ic orders.
Although these are all known, we have provided proofs for con venience
of the reader. Sections 3 and 4 contain preparations, where i n Section
3 we apply ﬁniteness results for unit equations. In Section 5 we ﬁnish
the proofs of Theorems 1.1–1.3. Finally, in Section 6 we gene ralize
the orders Zαto domains OS,α, whereOSis the ring of S-integers of
a number ﬁeld kandαis algebraic over k, and state and prove a8 J.-H. EVERTSE
generalization of Theorem 1.1 but with a notion of equivalen ce that is
slightly weaker than GL2(OS)-equivalence.
2.Lemmas over principal ideal domains
In this section, we have collected some generalities on rati onally
monogenic orders. We state and prove everything over an arbi trary
principal ideal domain Aof characteristic 0. Most of the results in
this section have been proved elsewhere in a more general con text, see
for instance [10, Chaps. 16, 17], [1], [6]. For convenience o f the reader
we have repeated the short proofs, specialized to the situat ion of this
paper. In the proofs of Theorems 1.1–1.3 we apply the results of the
present section with A=Z. In Section 6 we use a local-to-global ar-
gument, and apply the results of the present section to local izations of
OS.
In what follows, if Fis any ﬁeld, ξ∈P1(F) :=F∪{∞} andC=/parenleftbiga b
c d/parenrightbig
∈GL2(F), we write Cξ:=aξ+b
cξ+d, with the conventions that this
is∞ifξ=∞andc= 0;a/cifξ=∞andc/\e}atio\slash= 0;∞ifc/\e}atio\slash= 0and
ξ=−d/c.
LetAbe a principal ideal domain of characteristic 0, andkits ﬁeld
of fractions. Fix a ﬁnite extension Kofkof degree n≥3. LetLbe
its normal closure over kandx/mapsto→x(i)(i= 1,...,n ) thek-isomorphic
embeddings of KinL. Further, denote by AK,ALthe integral closures
ofAinKandL, respectively. Recall that both AK,ALare Dedekind
domains; in the case that A=Z,AKandALare just the rings of
integers of KandL.
Given any domain B⊇A, we call α,β∈KGL2(B)-equivalent if
there isC∈GL2(B)such that β=Cα.
Letα∈KwithK=k(α). Deﬁne the free A-module
(2.1) Mα:=/braceleftbig
x0+x1α+···+xn−1αn−1:x0,...,x n−1∈A}
and its ring of scalars
(2.2) Aα:={ξ∈K:ξMα⊆ Mα}.
As one easily veriﬁes, if α,βare twoGL2(A)-equivalent elements of A,
thenMα=λMβfor some λ∈K∗, and thus, Aα=Aβ.ORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 9
We give some other descriptions of Aα. Letfα=a0Xn+···+an∈
A[X]be a primitive minimal polynomial of α, i.e., with gcd(a0,...,a n) =
1. Such a polynomial exists since Ais a principal ideal domain.
Lemma 2.1. We have
(2.3) Aα=/braceleftbig
x0+x1ω1+···+xn−1ωn−1:x0,...,x n−1∈A/bracerightbig
where
ωi:=a0αi+a1αi−1+···+ai−1α(i= 1,...,n−1),
and
(2.4) Aα=A[α]∩A[α−1].
Identity (2.3) follows from [10, p. 365, Thm. 16.2.9, formul a (16.2.7)]),
while (2.4) is a consequence of [6, Prop. 2]. For convenience of the
reader, we repeat the proofs.
Proof. LetNαdenote the A-module on the right-hand side of (2.3).
We prove the inclusions Nα⊆Aα⊆A[α]∩A[α−1]⊆ Nα.
First observe that if 1≤i≤n−1,0≤j≤n−1, then
ωiαj=i−1/summationdisplay

ωiαj= (ωi−fα(α))αj=−n/summationdisplay
k=iakαi+j−k∈ Mαifi+j≥n,
implying Nα⊆Aα.
Second,Aα⊆ Mα∩α1−nMα⊆A[α]∩A[α−1].
Third, let ξ=P(α) =Q(α−1)∈A[α]∩A[α−1], where P,Q∈
A[X]. We prove by induction on degP, thatξ∈ Nα. FordegP= 0
this is clear. Let degP=r≥1. Consider the polynomial H(X) :=
XdegQP(X)−XdegQQ(X−1)∈A[X]. The polynomial His non-zero,
since otherwise P(X) =Q(X−1), which is impossible. Let bbe the
leading coeﬃcient of P. Thenbis also the leading coeﬃcient of H.
SinceH(α) = 0,fαmust divide Hink[X]. But by assumption, the
coeﬃcients of fαhave gcd 1, so by Gauss’ Lemma fαdividesHinA[X],
in particular, the leading coeﬃcient a0offαdividesb. Now if r≥n,
we have P(α) =P∗(α)whereP∗(X) =P(X)−(b/a0)Xr−nfα(X)is
a polynomial in A[X]of degree < rand we can apply the induction10 J.-H. EVERTSE
hypothesis. If r < n, thenP(α) = (b/a0)ωr+P∗(α), whereP∗∈A[X]
has degree < r. We know already that ωr∈A[α]∩A[α−1], soP∗(α)∈
A[α]∩A[α−1]. We can again apply the induction hypothesis. /square

Forα1,...,α r∈L, denote by [α1,...,α r]the fractional ideal of

generated A-submodule MofKand for distinct i,j∈ {1,...,n}, let
dij(M)be the fractional ideal of ALgenerated by ξ(i)−ξ(j)for all
ξ∈ M. Thus, if Mis generated as an A-module by ξ1,...,ξ r, we have

i/\e}atio\slash=j. Then
[α(i)−α(j)] = [1,α(i)]·[1,α(j)]·dij(Aα).
Proof. (cf. [10, Lemma 17.6.4]) Let ω1,...,ω n−1be as in (2.3). Then
αfα(X) = (X−α)(ω1Xn−1+ω2Xn−2+···+ωn),
whereωn:=−an. This implies
(α(i)−α(j))Xfα(X)

fractional ideal of ALgenerated by the coeﬃcients of g∈L[X]. UsingORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 11
that the coeﬃcients of fαhave gcd 1, together with (2.3), (2.5), we

Lemma 2.4. Suppose [K:k] =n≥4. Letα,βbe such that k(α) =

(ii) Suppose [K:k] =n≥4. Thenα,βareGL2(k)-equivalent if and

Proof. (cf. [10, Lemma 17.7.2]) (ii) From elementary projective ge -

Lemma 2.6. Assume that [K:k]≥3. Letα,βbe such that k(α) =
k(β) =KandAα=Aβ. Suppose that α,βareGL2(k)-equivalent.
Thenα,βareGL2(A)-equivalent.
Proof. (cf. [10, Proposition 17.6.5]) Since Ais a principal ideal domain,
we may assume that β=Cα, where the entries of Cbelong to Aand
have gcd 1. Further, Ccan be put into Smith Normal Form, i.e., there
are matrices U,V∈GL2(A)such that UCV=/parenleftbiga0

Letβ1:=Uβ,α1:=V−1α. Then since α,β/\e}atio\slash∈kwe have α1,β1/\e}atio\slash=∞
and moreover, Aα1=Aβ1andβ1=aα1. We have to show that a∈A∗.
Letfα1(X) =a0Xn+···+an∈A[X]be a primitive minimal poly-
nomial of α1, i.e., with gcd(a0,...,a n) = 1 . Thenβ1has primitive
minimal polynomial
fβ1(X) =λfα1(X/a) =λ(a−na0Xn+a1−na1Xn−1+···+an),
whereλ∈kis such that the coeﬃcients of fβ1are inAand have gcd 1.

SinceAα1=Aβ1, this must imply

3.Application of unit equations
LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree n≥4andLits normal closure. In
the case n= 4we don’t impose any constraints on L, while for n≥5
we assume that Gal(L/Q)is5-transitive.
We callα1∈K k-special ifK=Q(α1)and there are α2,...,α ksuch
thatZα1=···=Zαkandα1,...,α kare pairwise GL2(Z)-inequivalent.
We callα1special if it is2-special.
Theorem 1.1 follows, once we have shown that in the case n= 4, the
3-special numbers of Klie in only ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence
classes, and in the case n≥5that the special numbers of Klie in only
ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence classes. Indeed, the orders of Kwith
krational monogenizations are all of the shape Zαwhereαisk-special,
and if such αlie in only ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence classes, there
are only ﬁnitely many orders Zα.ORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 13
In the present section we prove the following proposition. H ere, we
apply some results from the theory of unit equations.
Proposition 3.1. (i) LetKbe a quartic number ﬁeld. Then the set of
3-special numbers of Kis contained in ﬁnitely many GL2(Q)-equivalence
classes.
(ii) LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree n≥5such that the Galois group
of its normal closure Lis5-transitive. Then the set of special numbers
ofKis contained in ﬁnitely many GL2(Q)-equivalence classes.
We will show later (see Proposition 5.1 below) that a GL2(Q)-equivalence
class of special numbers is the union of ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence
classes.
We start with some initial observations. Let α,β∈KwithQ(α) =
Q(β) =K,Zα=Zβandα,βGL2(Z)-inequivalent. Then
(3.1)crijkl(α)/\e}atio\slash= crijkl(β)
for all pairwise distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}.
Indeed, suppose that for some tuple (i,j,k,l)we have equality, say
(1,2,3,4). In the case n= 4this implies equality for each permutation
(i,j,k,l)of(1,2,3,4)sincecrijkl(·)is a fractional linear transformation
ofcr1234(·). In the case n≥5, we obtain equality for all i,j,k,l since
by our assumption on the normal closure L, there is σ∈Gal(L/Q)
that maps cr1234(·)tocrijkl(·). Lemma 2.5 now implies that α,βare
GL2(Q)-equivalent, and subsequently Lemma 2.6 that α,βareGL2(Z)-
equivalent, contrary to our assumption.
Another important observation is the identity for cross rat ios
(3.2) crijkl(α)+crilkj(α) = 1
for allα∈Kand all pairwise distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}. Now let
α,βbe such that Q(α) =Q(β) =KandZα=Zβ. Put
εijkl:=crijkl(β)
crijkl(α);
then from (3.2) and Lemma 2.4 we deduce
(3.3)crijkl(α)·εijkl+crilkj(α)·εilkj= 1, εijkl∈ O∗
L, εilkj∈ O∗
L,
whereOLis the ring of integers of L. This allows us to apply the theory
of unit equations.14 J.-H. EVERTSE
We ﬁrst prove part (i), and then part (ii).
Proof of part (i) of Proposition 3.1. LetKbe a quartic number ﬁeld,
and letα∈Kbe3-special. Choose β,γ∈Ksuch that α,β,γ are
pairwise GL2(Z)-inequivalent, and Zα=Zβ=Zγ. Put
εijkl:=crijkl(β)
crijkl(α), ηijkl:=crijkl(γ)
crijkl(α)
for each permutation (i,j,k,l)of(1,2,3,4).
By (3.1)–(3.3), the pairs (1,1),(ε1234,ε1432),(η1234,η1432)are three
distinct solutions to the equation
(3.4) cr1234(α)x+cr1432(α)y= 1inx,y∈ O∗
L.
We now apply the following result on unit equations.1
Lemma 3.2. LetFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 0andΓa subgroup of F∗
of ﬁnite rank. Then there are only ﬁnitely many pairs (a,b)∈F∗×F∗
witha+b= 1such that the equation
ax+by= 1inx,y∈Γ
has more than two solutions, the pair (1,1)included.
Proof. This is essentially a result of Győry, Stewart, Tijdeman, an d
the author [11, Thm. 1], see also [9, Thm. 6.1.6]. Their proof uses a
ﬁniteness result for linear unit equations in several unkno wns, which in
turn follows from Schmidt’s Subspace Theorem. /square
We continue with the proof of part (i) of Proposition 3.1. Sin ce (3.4)
has three distinct solutions in O∗
Lincluding (1,1)andO∗
Lis ﬁnitely gen-
erated, Lemma 3.2 implies that if αruns through the 3-special numbers
ofK, thencr1234(α)runs through a ﬁnite set. If (i,j,k,l)is a permuta-
tion of(1,2,3,4), thencrijkl(·)is a fractional linear transformation of
cr1234(·), hencecrijkl(α)runs through a ﬁnite set as well. Now Lemma
2.5(ii) implies that the 3-special numbers α∈Klie in only ﬁnitely
manyGL2(Q)-equivalence classes. /square
Proof of part (ii) of Proposition 3.1. LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree
n≥5such that the Galois group of its normal closure Lis5-transitive.
1Equations with unknowns from a multiplicative group Γof ﬁnite rank are often
called ‘unit equations’ since in most applications, Γis the unit group of a domain.ORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 15
Take a special α∈K. Choose βsuch that Zβ=Zα. Recall that by
Lemma 2.4
εijkl:=crijkl(β)
crijkl(α)∈ O∗
L
for all pairwise distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}. Viewing (3.2) and (3.3) as
linear equations in crijkl(α)andcrlijk(α)we derive from Cramer’s rule,
(3.5) crijkl(α) =εilkj−1
εilkj−εijkl.
Our strategy is as follows. Using algebraic relations betwe en theεijkl
and ﬁniteness results for unit equations, we show that if αruns through
the special numbers of K, then one of the εijkl, sayε1234, runs through
a ﬁnite set. Our assumption that Gal(L/Q)is5-transitive implies that
the numbers εijklare all conjugate to one another, thus it follows that
εijklruns through a ﬁnite set for all i,j,k,l . But then, (3.5) implies
thatcrijkl(α)runs through a ﬁnite set for all i,j,k,l . Finally, Lemma
2.5(ii) implies that the special numbers α∈Klie in only ﬁnitely many
GL2(Q)-equivalence classes.
We ﬁrst collect some algebraic relations between the εijkl. It is straight-
forward to verify
(3.6)

for all pairwise distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}and moreover,
(3.7)εijkl
εijkm=εjmlk
for all pairwise distinct i,j,k,l,m ∈ {1,...,n}.
We derive a few more relations. From (3.5) and (3.6) it follow s that
crijkl(β) =εijklcrijkl(α) =εilkj−1
εiljk−1. Picking a ﬁfth index m, we get
1 =crjmlk(β)crijkm(β)
crijkl(β)=εjklm−1
εjkml−1·εimkj−1
εimjk−1·εiljk−1
εilkj−1.
We apply this with (i,j,k,l,m ) = (5,1,2,3,4). Thus, we obtain
(3.8)(ε1234−1)(ε1245−1)(ε1253−1) = (ε1243−1)(ε1254−1)(ε1235−1),
where, as mentioned before, all entries belong to O∗
L. We apply the
following result.16 J.-H. EVERTSE
Lemma 3.3. LetFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 0andΓa subgroup of
F∗of ﬁnite rank. Consider the equation
(x1−1)(x2−1)(x3−1) =(y1−1)(y2−1)(y3−1) (3.9)
inx1,x2,x3,y1,y2,y3∈Γ.
There is a ﬁnite subset SofΓsuch that every solution of (3.9)satisﬁes
one of the following:
(a)at least one of x1,...,y 3belongs to S;
(b)there are s1,s2,s3∈ {±1}such that (x1,x3,x3)is a permutation
of(ys1
1,ys2
2,ys3
3);
(c)at least one of the numbers in {xixj,xi/xj,yiyj,yi/yj: 1≤i <
j≤3}is either −1or a primitive cube root of unity.
Proof. This is a result of Bérczes, Győry, and the author [2, Prop.
8.1]. They deduced the above lemma from a ﬁniteness result fo r linear
unit equations in several unknowns, and so again Schmidt’s S ubspace
Theorem is at the background. /square
We apply Lemma 3.3 with Γ =O∗
Lto (3.8). We show that each of the
three cases (a), (b), (c) gives rise to only ﬁnitely many poss ible values
forε1234. Recall that we assume that Gal(L/Q)is5-transitive. Hence for
any two quintuples of distinct indices (i,j,k,l,m )and(i′,j′,k′,l′,m′),
there isσ∈Gal(L/Q)mapping α(i),β(i),...,α(m),β(m)toα(i′),β(i′),...,α(m′),β(m′),
respectively. Consequently, any two εijkl,εi′,j′,k′,l′are conjugate to each
other. Similarly, from an identity between ε-s with indices from a quin-
tuple(i,j,k,l,m )we can derive a similar identity with indices from
(i′,j′,k′,l′,m′)by applying a suitable element of Gal(L/Q).
The above observations imply that if we have shown that one of the
εijklruns through a ﬁnite set, then so does ε1234. This settles case (a).
As for (b) and (c), using again the above observations, we are left with
the following subcases. Let Tdenote the group of 6-th roots of unity
inL.
Case b1. ε1234=ε1243.
Then by (3.6), ε1432=ε1234
ε1243= 1, which by conjugacy implies ε1234= 1.
Case b2. ε1234=ε−1
1243.
By (3.6), ε−1
1243=ε−1
1234ε1432, soε2
1234=ε1432. By conjugacy, we may
interchange the indices 2,3, while keeping 1and4ﬁxed, so we haveORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 17
alsoε1324=ε−1
1342. Applying again (3.6), this gives ε1234=ε−1
1432. Hence
ε3
1234= 1.
Case b3. ε1234=ε1254.
By (3.6), (3.7), 1 =ε1234
ε1254=ε2143
ε2145=ε1534. By conjugacy, ε1234= 1.
Case b4. ε1234=ε−1
1254.
By conjugacy, we may interchange 2and3, keeping 1,4,5ﬁxed, so
we have ε1324=ε−1
1354, which together with (3.6) implies ε1234=ε1354.
From (3.6) and (3.7) we deduceε1254
ε1354=ε1234. Multiplying these relations
together, we obtain ε3
1234= 1.
Case c1. ε1234·ε1245∈ T.
By interchanging 3and5, keeping 1,2,4ﬁxed, we see that ε1254·ε1243∈
T. Using (3.6), (3.7), we get
ε1234·ε1245
ε1254·ε1243=ε1534
ε2534=ε1532∈ T
and by conjugacy, ε1234∈ T.
Case c2.ε1234
ε1245∈ T.
Interchanging 2and3, keeping 1,4,5ﬁxed, we obtainε1324
ε1345∈ T, and
then, using ε1324=ε−1
1234,ε1245·ε1345∈ T. By taking conjugates, we get
ε1234·ε1235∈ T, and also ε1234·ε5234∈ T. Applying (3.7), the latter
yieldsε1234·ε1234
ε1235∈ T. Henceε3
1234∈ T.
As mentioned above, this completes the proof of Proposition 3.1./square
4.Investigation of GL2(k)-classes
LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree ≥4. In the next section we show
(Proposition 5.1) that each GL2(Q)-equivalence class of special num-
bers inKis the union of ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence classes. To-
gether with Proposition 3.1 this will imply Theorem 1.1. In t he present
section, we develop some machinery needed for the proof of Pr oposition
5.1. We have worked out this machinery for arbitrary princip al ideal
domains of characteristic 0so that we can use it also in Section 6 where
we will prove a generalization of Theorem 1.1 over rings of S-integers
of number ﬁelds.
LetAbe a principal ideal domain of characteristic 0,kits ﬁeld of

closure of Koverk. We consider so-called special pairs inK, i.e., pairs
(α,β)such that k(α) =k(β) =K,Aα=Aβandα,βareGL2(A)-
inequivalent. Two special pairs (α,β)and(α∗,β∗)are called GL2(k)-
equivalent if α∗isGL2(k)-equivalent to αandβ∗isGL2(k)-equivalent
toβ.
Let(α,β),(α∗,β∗)be twoGL2(k)-equivalent special pairs. Then
since we are working over a principal ideal domain A,

pairwise distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}. Then
(4.2) ∆AL⊇d5·a(α,β)2.
Recall that by Lemmas 2.5 and 2.6, the ideal a(α,β)is not zero. We
mention that our proof implies also that ∆/∆′∈A∗, but this will not
be needed.
We start with some preparations and then prove two lemmas, wh ich
together imply Proposition 4.1.
LetC,C′be the matrices from (4.1). Since Ais a principal ideal
domain, there are matrices U,V,U′,V′∈GL2(A)such that
UCV=/parenleftbigg∆ 0

1,(α1,β1),(α∗

equivalent special pairs, and a(α1,β1) =a(α,β). So in the proof of
Proposition 4.1 we may replace α,α∗,β,β∗byα1,α∗

words, without loss of generality we may assume

So assume (4.3). Let
fα=a0Xn+···+an, fβ=b0Xn+···+bn
be primitive minimal polynomials of α,β. By Lemma 2.1, the ring
Aα=AβhasA-module bases
{1,ω1,...,ω n−1},{1,ρ1,...,ρ n−1}
respectively, where
(4.4) ωi=i−1/summationdisplay
j=0ajαi−j, ρi=i−1/summationdisplay
j=0bjβi−j(i= 1,...,n−1).
Hence there are a matrix M= (mij)i,j=1,...,n−1∈GLn−1(A)andmi,0∈

(4.5) ρi=mi,0+n−1/summationdisplay

Let us write [...]for the fractional ideal of Agenerated by the elements

Lemma 4.2. The following holds:
[∆] = [∆′], (4.6)

gcd(mii,∆) = 1 fori= 1,...,n−1, (4.8)
[a0,∆] = [b0,∆]. (4.9)
Proof. By (4.3), there are non-zero λ,µ∈k, such that α∗,β∗have
primitive minimal polynomials
fα∗=λ(a0∆−nXn+a1∆1−nXn−1+···+an),
fβ∗=µ(b0∆′−nXn+b1∆′1−nXn−1+···+bn).(4.10)
From (4.3), (4.10) it follows that Aα∗=Aβ∗hasA-module bases
(4.11){1,λ∆1−nω1,...,λ∆−1ωn−1},{1,µ∆′1−nρ1,...,µ∆′−1ρn−1}.
Hence there are M∗= (m∗

where
(4.12) tij=µ∆′i−nmij=λ∆j−nm∗
ij(i,j= 1,...,n−1).
SinceM= (mij)∈GLn−1(A), the entries of each row of Mhave
gcd1. It follows that the fractional ideal generated by the entri es of
thei-th row of T= (tij)i,j=1,...,n−1is[µ∆′i−n]. Hence the fractional
ideal generated by all entries of Tis[µ∆′1−n]. Similarly, since also
M∗∈GLn−1(A), the fractional ideal generated by the entries of the
j-th column of Tis[λ∆j−n]. Hence the fractional ideal generated by
all entries of Tis[λ∆1−n]. So[λ∆1−n] = [µ∆′1−n]. On the other hand,
usingdetM∈A∗,detM∗∈A∗, we ﬁnd [detT] = [λn−1∆−n(n−1)/2] =
[µn−1∆′−n(n−1)/2]. By combining these two identities, using that n≥4,
we obtain
[λ] = [µ],[∆] = [∆′].
This proves (4.6). Further, by (4.12),
[mij] = [∆j−im∗
ij],
and since m∗
ij∈Athis implies (4.7). Combining (4.7) with detM∈A∗
we obtain (4.8).
It remains to prove (4.9). Note that by (4.4) we have
ω2

1=b1ρ1−b0ρ2.
Substituting (4.5) and using the congruences (4.7), we obta in the fol-
lowing congruences modulo ∆Aα:

For the remainder of the proof of (4.2) it will be convenient t o work

Next, assume that

Then (4.9) implies that also
(4.20) v(b0)>1

We ﬁrst observe
(4.21) v(a1)≤δv, v(b1)≤δv.
Indeed, recall that the discriminant D(F)of a binary form F=/summationtextn

Ynfα(X/Y)andG(X,Y) =F(X,Y)−a0Xn−a1Xn−1Y, and noting
thatD(G) = 0 sinceGis divisible by Y2, we have
δv=v(D(F)) =v(D(F)−D(G))≥min(v(a0),v(a1)).
By (4.19), (4.14) we have v(a0)>1
2v(∆)> δv. Hencev(a1)≤δv. The
proof ofv(b1)≤δvis the same, using (4.20) instead of (4.19).
Assume without loss of generality that
v(α(1)) = min(v(α(1)),...,v(α(n))).
Then
(4.22) v(α(i))≥ −1
2δvfori= 2,...,n.
Indeed, suppose that v(α(i))<−1

that of the last inequality (4.21), (4.14).
Letkbe an index such that
v(β(k)) = min(v(β(1)),...,v(β(n))).
Then completely similarly to (4.22), (4.23) we derive

5.Proof of Theorems 1.1–1.3
LetKbe a number ﬁeld. Recall that α1∈Kis called k-special if
K=Q(α1)and there are α2,...,α ksuch that α1,...,α kare pairwise
GL2(Z)-inequivalent and Zα1=···=Zαk. A2-special number in Kis
called special. We ﬁrst prove the following proposition.
Proposition 5.1. LetKbe a number ﬁeld of degree n≥3. Then
everyGL2(Q)-equivalence class of special α∈Kis the union of at
most ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence classes.
Proof. First let n= 3. By Lemma 2.5 (i) and Lemma 2.6, any two
numbers α,βwithZα=ZβareGL2(Z)-equivalent. Hence there are no
special numbers in K.
Next let n≥4. Denote by Lthe normal closure of K. LetCbe
aGL2(Q)-equivalence class of special α∈K. We ﬁrst split Cinto a
ﬁnite collection of subclasses. Since cross ratios of GL2(Q)-equivalent
numbers are the same, we may deﬁne crijkl(C) := cr ijkl(α)for anyα∈ C
and any four distinct indices i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}. For every α∈ Cthere
isβ∈Ksuch that Zα=Zβandβis notGL2(Z)-equivalent to α. From
Lemma 2.4 and (3.3) it follows that εijkl:= crijkl(β)/crijkl(α)∈ O∗
Lfor
all distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}and
(5.1) crijkl(C)εijkl+crilkj(C)εilkj= 1
for all distinct i,j,k,l∈ {1,...,n}.
We apply the following result, due to Lang [14].
Lemma 5.2. LetFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, leta,b∈F∗, and let
Γbe a subgroup of F∗of ﬁnite rank. Then the equation
ax+by= 1inx,y∈Γ26 J.-H. EVERTSE
has only ﬁnitely many solutions.
By applying this to (5.1) with Γ =O∗
L, we infer that there is a ﬁnite
set depending only on Csuch that for all i,j,k,l ,εijklbelongs to this
set, and so, for all i,j,k,l ,crijkl(β)belongs to a ﬁnite set depending
only onC. Now Lemma 2.5 (ii) implies that the GL2(Q)-equivalence
class ofβbelongs to a ﬁnite collection depending only on C. Further,
by Lemma 2.6, the classes in this collection are disjoint fro mC. This
implies that Ccan be partitioned into a ﬁnite collection of subclasses
C(D) :={α∈ C:there isβ∈ DwithZα=Zβ},
whereDis aGL2(Q)-equivalence class of special numbers distinct from
C.
Take aGL2(Q)-equivalence class D /\e}atio\slash=Cfor which C(D)/\e}atio\slash=∅. We have
to show that C(D)is the union of ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence
classes. We use that for every positive integer ∆there is a ﬁnite set of
integer2×2-matrices F(∆), such that if Cis any2×2-matrix with
|detC|= ∆, then there is U∈GL2(Z)withUC∈ F(∆).
Fixα∈ C(D)and then β∈ DwithZα=Zβ. Then choose α∗∈ C(D);
we letα∗vary. Further choose β∗∈ DwithZα∗=Zβ∗. Thus,(α,β)
and(α∗,β∗)are twoGL2(Q)-equivalent special pairs as in Proposition
4.1, with A=Z. LetCbe the matrix from (4.1), so with α∗=Cα,
and put∆ :=|detC|. Then there is U∈GL2(Z)such that
UC=:C1∈ F(∆).
Letα∗∗:=Uα∗=C1α. By Proposition 4.1, ∆belongs to a ﬁnite set
depending on α,β, hence so does C1, and thus α∗∗. This implies that the
GL2(Z)-equivalence class of α∗belongs to a ﬁnite collection depending
onα,β. This shows that indeed, C(D)is the union of ﬁnitely many
GL2(Z)-equivalence classes. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.1. Propositions 3.1 and 5.1 imply that if Kis quar-
tic then the 3-special numbers α∈Klie in ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-
equivalence classes. Further, if Khas degree ≥5and the Galois group
of its normal closure is 5-transitive, then the special numbers in Klie
in ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence classes. As we observed in Section
3, this implies Theorem 1.1. /squareORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 27
Proof of Theorem 1.2. LetKbe either a quartic ﬁeld, or a number ﬁeld
of degree ≥5such that the Galois group of the normal closure of Kis
5-transitive. Consider a Hermite equivalence class Hof polynomials in
PI(K)that falls apart into at least three GL2(Z)-equivalence classes
if[K:Q] = 4 , and into at least two GL2(Z)-equivalence classes if
[K:Q]≥5. Recall that two polynomials f,g∈ PI(K)are Hermite
equivalent if fhas a root αandga rootβsuch that Q(α) =Q(β) =K
andMβ=λMαfor some non-zero λ. This implies Zα=Zβ. Now if
f,g∈ HareGL2(Z)-inequivalent, then so are α,β. So the order O=Zα
has at least three rational monogenizations if [K:Q] = 4, and at least
two rational monogenizations if [K:Q]≥5. SinceOis an order of
a conjugate of KandKhas only ﬁnitely many conjugates, Theorem
1.1 implies that there are only ﬁnitely many possibilities f orO. Given
O, the set of αwithZα=Ois the union of ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-
equivalence classes. Hence the set of f∈ PI(K)having a root αwith
Zα=Ois the union of ﬁnitely many GL2(Z)-equivalence classes. The
classHis the union of some of these classes. So we have only ﬁnitely
many possibilities for H. /square
Proof of Theorem 1.3. Take an algebraic number αof degree n≥3.
Letfα(X) =a0Xn+···+an∈Z[X]be the primitive minimal polyno-
mial ofαandFα(X,Y) :=Xnfα(X/Y)its homogenization. By Thue’s
Theorem [18], there is a number Csuch that if x,yare integers with
Fα(x,y) =±1, then|x|,|y| ≤C. Letp,qbe distinct prime num-
bers such that p,q > C∗:= max( C,|a0|,|an|). The number (q/p)α
has primitive minimal polynomial fqα/p(X) =qnfα(pX/q)(one ver-
iﬁes easily that the coeﬃcients of this polynomial have gcd 1, since
p,q >|a0|,|an|). The polynomial fqα/p, hence by (1.4) the order Zqα/p,
has discriminant (pq)n(n−1)D(fα). So the orders Zqα/p, withp,qrunning
through the primes exceeding C∗, are all diﬀerent.
We claim that among these orders, at most ﬁnitely many are mon o-
genic. Indeed, suppose that Zqα/pis monogenic. Then Zqα/p=Zβ=
Z[β]for some algebraic integer β. Assume that βisGL2(Z)-equivalent
toqα/p. That is, β=a(qα/p)+b
c(qα/p)+dfor some/parenleftbiga b

necessarily monic primitive minimal polynomial of βis
fβ(X) =±qn(−cX+a)nfα/parenleftBigp(dX−b)
q(−cX+a)/parenrightBig
.28 J.-H. EVERTSE
Its homogenization is
Fβ(X,Y) =Ynfβ(X/Y) =±Fα(p(dX−bY),q(−cX+aY)).
Sinceβis integral, the leading coeﬃcient of fβis1, which implies
1 =Fβ(1,0) =±Fα(pd,−qc). But this is impossible, since at least
one of|pd|,|qc|exceeds the bound Cdeﬁned above. We conclude that
βcannot be GL2(Z)-equivalent to qα/p. So any order Zqα/pthat is
monogenic must have two rational monogenizations. By Propo sition
5.1 there are at most ﬁnitely many pairs of distinct primes p,q > C∗
for which this is possible. This leaves us with inﬁnitely man y rationally
monogenic orders Zqα/pthat are not monogenic. /square
6.A generalization over the S-integers
In this section, we will state and prove a generalization of T heorem
1.1 to the ring OSofS-integers of a number ﬁeld. The ring of S-
integers is a Dedekind domain, but in general not a principal ideal
domain, therefore, the arguments from the previous section s cannot be
carried over. Thus, in our generalization of Theorem 1.1 we w ill not
work with GL2(OS)-equivalence of algebraic numbers, but rather with
numbers that are GL2(Op)-equivalent for all non-zero prime ideals pof
OS, whereOpis the localization of OSatp.
Before stating and proving our result, we have collected som e gen-
eralizations of the material from Section 2 to Dedekind doma ins of
characteristic 0. Most of these are equivalent, but for our purposes
more convenient formulations of material from [10, Chap. 17 ].
LetAbe a Dedekind domain of characteristic 0andkits quotient
ﬁeld. Denote by P(A)the collection of non-zero prime ideals of Aand
byCl(A)the class group of A(fractional ideals modulo principal frac-
tional ideals). Further, let Cl(A)[m]be the subgroup of elements of
Cl(A)whosem-th power is the principal ideal class. The localization
ofAat a prime ideal p∈ P(A)is given by
Ap:={x/y:x∈A,y∈A\p}.
We deﬁne the group of matrices
G(A) :=/intersectiondisplay
p∈P(A)k∗GL2(Ap),ORDERS WITH FEW RATIONAL MONOGENIZATIONS 29
that is the group of matrices Csuch that for every p∈ P(A)there is
λp∈k∗withλ−1
pC∈GL2(Ap).
Letα,β∈kbe of degree ≥3overk. We say that α,βareG(A)-
equivalent if there is C∈G(A)withβ=Cα. Then
α,βareG(A)-equivalent (6.1)
⇐⇒α,βareGL2(Ap)-equivalent for every p∈ P(A).
Indeed,⇒is clear. As for ⇐, suppose that α,βareGL2(Ap)-equivalent
for every p∈ P(A). Then there is C∈GL2(k)such that β=Cα. But
Cis determined uniquely up to a scalar in k∗, henceC∈k∗GL2(Ap)
for every p∈ P(A), i.e.,C∈G(A).
We compare G(A)-equivalence with GL2(A)-equivalence.
Lemma 6.1. G(A)/k∗GL2(A)∼=Cl(A)[2].
Proof. Let[a1,...,a r]denote the fractional ideal of Agenerated by
a1,...,a rand for a matrix Cwith entries in k, let[C]denote the
fractional ideal generated by the entries of C. We claim that
(6.2) G(A) ={C∈GL2(k) : [detC] = [C]2}.
Indeed, let C∈G(A). Then for all p∈ P(A)there isλp∈k∗such
thatλ−1
pC∈GL2(Ap), hence[C]2·Ap=λ2
pAp= [detC]·Apfor allp,
implying [C]2= [detC]. Conversely, assume [detC] = [C]2. Then for
allp∈ P(A)there isλp∈k∗with[C]Ap=λpApsinceApis a principal
ideal domain. So det(λ−1
pC) =λ−2
pdetC∈A∗
p, i.e.,λ−1
pC∈GL2(Ap)
for allp∈ P(A), implying C∈G(A).
Now deﬁne the map
G(A)→Cl(A)[2] :C/mapsto→ideal class of [C].
By (6.2) this is a well-deﬁned group homomorphism. The kerne l of this
homomorphism is the group of matrices C∈G(A)such that [C]is
principal, this is precisely k∗GL2(A). To show that the homomorphism
is surjective, pick any ideal class of Awhose square is principal, and
take an ideal from this class. By a well-known property of Ded ekind
domains, this ideal is generated by two elements, say it is [a,b]. Then,
using another property of Dedekind domains, [a2,b2] = [a,b]2= [λ]for
someλ∈A, hence there are u,v∈Asuch that ua2−vb2=λ. Take
C=/parenleftbiga b

. Then[C]2= [a,b]2= [λ] = [detC], soC∈G(A), andC

Lemma 6.1 implies that a G(A)-equivalence class is the union of pre-

We now specialize to rings of S-integers of number ﬁelds. Let kbe a
number ﬁeld and Okits ring of integers. Let Sbe a ﬁnite set of non-zero
prime ideals of Ok, and
OS:={x/y:x,y∈ Ok, ycomposed of prime ideals from S}
the ring of S-integers. Similarly as before, we denote by P(OS)the set
of non-zero prime ideals of OS. Further, for p∈ P(OS), we denote by
Opthe localization of OSatp, so that
G(OS) =/intersectiondisplay
p∈P(OS)k∗GL2(Op).
LetKbe a ﬁnite extension of kof degree n≥4, andLthe normal
closure of K/k.
Denote by OS,Kthe integral closure of OSinK. By anOS-order of
Kwe mean a ring Osuch that OS⊆ O ⊆ O S,KandkO=K.
Recall that α,β∈Kare called G(OS)-equivalent if β=Cαfor
someC∈G(OS). Arational monogenization of anOS-orderOis a
G(OS)-equivalence class of αsuch that OS,α=O.
TakingαwithK=k(α), we say that the Galois group Gal(L/k)is
t-transitive if the action of Gal(L/k)on the set of conjugates of αinL
ist-transitive.
We are now ready to state our generalization.
Theorem 6.5. Letkbe an algebraic number ﬁeld and Sa ﬁnite set of
prime ideals from Ok. Further, let Kbe a ﬁnite extension of k, andL
the normal closure of K/k.
(i) Assume that [K:k] = 4. ThenKhas only ﬁnitely many OS-orders
with more than two rational monogenizations.
(ii) Assume that [K:k]≥5and that Gal(L/k)is5-transitive. Then K
has only ﬁnitely many OS-orders with more than one rational monog-
enization.
The proof is very similar to that of Theorem 1.1. We will mainl y
focus on the diﬀerences.32 J.-H. EVERTSE
We keep the notation and assumptions from Theorem 6.5. We cal l
α1∈K k-special if k(α1) =Kand if there are α2,...,α k∈Ksuch that
α1,...,α kare pairwise G(OS)-inequivalent and OS,α1=···=OS,αk.
We callα1special if it is 2-special.
Proof of Theorem 6.5. It suﬃces to show that if [K:k] = 4 then the
3-special numbers in Klie in at most ﬁnitely many G(OS)-equivalence
classes, while if [K:k]≥5andGal(L/k)is5-transitive then the
special numbers in Klie in at most ﬁnitely many G(OS)-equivalence
classes.
Step 1. The3-special numbers in Kif[K:k] = 4, respectively the
special numbers in Kif[K:k]≥5lie in at most ﬁnitely many GL2(k)-
equivalence classes.

Step 2. LetKbe any extension of kwith[K:k]≥4. Then each
GL2(k)-equivalence class of special numbers in Kis the union of ﬁnitely
manyG(OS)-equivalence classes.
LetCbe aGL2(k)-equivalence class of special numbers in K. Com-
pletely similarly as in the proof of Proposition 5.1, applyi ng Lemma

Fixα∈ C(D), and then β∈ DwithOS,α=OS,β. LetTbe the

α∗∈ C(D)that we let vary, and then β∗∈ DwithOS,α∗=OS,β∗.
Letpbe a prime ideal of OS. We apply the theory of Section 4 with
A=Op. By (6.3) we have Op,α=Op,β,Op,α∗=Op,β∗. Hence(α,β)and
(α∗,β∗)are twoGL2(k)-equivalent special pairs as in Proposition 4.1.
LetCbe the matrix from (4.1), i.e., with α∗=Cα, and put ∆ := det C.
We use that there is a ﬁnite set F([∆])of2×2-matrices with entries in
Op, depending only on pand on the ideal [∆] := ∆ Op, such that there
isU∈GL2(Op)with
UC=:C1∈ F([∆]).
Letα∗∗:=Uα∗=C1α. Proposition 4.1 implies that [∆]belongs to
a ﬁnite set depending on α,βandp, hence so does C1, and thus α∗∗.
This implies that the GL2(Op)-equivalence class of α∗belongs to a ﬁnite
collection depending on α,β,p.
But forp/\e}atio\slash∈T, i.e., for all but ﬁnitely many p, Proposition 4.1 implies
that[∆] = [1] , henceα∗isGL2(Op)-equivalent to α. Now from (6.1)
it follows that there is a ﬁnite collection of G(OS)-equivalence classes
depending only on α,βto which α∗must belong. This shows that
indeed,C(D)is the union of ﬁnitely many G(OS)-equivalence classes,
