Particles hopping on a two-dimensional hyperbolic lattice feature unconventional energy spectra and wave
functions that provide a largely uncharted platform for topological phases of matter beyond the Euclidean
paradigm. Using real-space topological markers as well as Chern numbers defined in the higher-dimensional
momentum space of hyperbolic band theory, we construct and investigate hyperbolic Haldane models, which
are generalizations of Haldane’s honeycomb-lattice model to various hyperbolic lattices. We present a general
framework to characterize point-group symmetries in hyperbolic tight-binding models, and use this framework
to constrain the multiple first and second Chern numbers in momentum space. We observe several topological
gaps characterized by first Chern numbers of value 1 and 2. The momentum-space Chern numbers respect the
predicted symmetry constraints and agree with real-space topological markers, indicating a direct connection to
observables such as the number of chiral edge modes. With our large repertoire of models, we further demon-
strate that the topology of hyperbolic Haldane models is trivialized for lattices with strong negative curvature.
I. INTRODUCTION
In a series of recent experiments, two-dimensional (2D) hy-
perbolic lattices emulating negatively curved space have been
realized in circuit quantum electrodynamics and with topolec-
trical circuits [1–5]. These experimental breakthroughs have
opened up a new research direction, namely, the study of hy-
perbolic matter . The pivotal question permeating this arena
is whether inclusion of negative curvature as a further tun-
able ingredient in condensed-matter setups facilitates unique
physical phenomena or advantages over flat (Euclidean) sys-
tems. On the one hand, the great versatility of the elec-
trical circuit platform enabled the realization of topologi-
cal models [3, 4], in which a macroscopic fraction of all
eigenstates are found to participate in the topological edge
mode [6]. The above experimental achievements stimulated
ample theoretical research into the design and characteriza-
tion of Hamiltonians in curved spaces. First theoretical in-
vestigations of topological models on hyperbolic lattices ap-
peared in Refs. 4–8. Other recently investigated aspects of
hyperbolic lattices include hyperbolic band theory [9, 10]
and crystallography [11], non-Abelian Bloch states [10, 12–
15], periodic boundary conditions [10, 16–19] and the ther-
modynamic limit [18–20], Hofstadter spectra [8, 21–23], ef-
fects of strong correlations [17, 24–26], continuum approxi-
mation [27], exact trace formulas [28], elastic vibrations [29],
flat bands [1, 30–33], connections to holography [34–38], and
higher-order topological phenomena [39, 40]. It is by now
established that hyperbolic lattices exhibit single-particle dy-
namics and many-body phenomena richly distinct from those
observed in Euclidean lattices.

†tomas.bzdusek@uzh.chIn this work, we investigate the interplay of symmetry and
topology in tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices. Par-
ticular attention is given to generalizations of the seminal Hal-
dane model, originally defined on the {6,3}honeycomb lat-
tice [41], to a variety of regular {p,q}hyperbolic lattices.
Here, the Schl ¨afli symbol{p,q}stands for a tessellation of
the 2D plane by regular p-sided polygons (or “tiles”) with q
of them meeting at each vertex. For ( p−2)(q−2)=4, this
comprises a tessellation of the Euclidean plane, whereas in the
infinite number of cases with ( p−2)(q−2)>4, we have a tes-
sellation of the hyperbolic plane with constant negative curva-
ture. The original Haldane model transforms the ground state
of the non-interacting tight-binding model for graphene from
a semimetal to a Chern insulator by introducing complex-
valued second-neighbor hopping amplitudes t2e±iϕ, where±ϕ
correspond to alternating magnetic fluxes through parts of the
tiles, in addition to a sublattice mass mwhich trivializes the
Chern insulator for large m[41, 42]. Analogously, on a gen-
eral{p,q}lattice, complex-valued Haldane hoppings can be
consistently assigned to all second-neighbor pairs, and the
sublattice mass can be realized by staggered on-site potentials
±mif the lattice is bipartite (i.e., if it has an even value of p).
The key aspect that makes the characterization of band
topology in hyperbolic lattices challenging is the non-
commutative nature of translations in curved space. Specif-
ically, the translation symmetry groups of 2D hyperbolic
lattices are non-Abelian groups known as Fuchsian groups,
which contrast with the commutative translation group Z2
in the 2D Euclidean case. Hyperbolic band theory (HBT)
and crystallography [9–11] imply that the non-commutativity
of the translation generators necessitates a 2 g-dimensional
Brillouin zone (BZ) torus spanned by momenta {ki}2g
i=1, each
component valued in the range [ −π,+π], where gis the
genus of the compactified hyperbolic unit cell and is strictly
greater than 1. In addition, higher-dimensional irreduciblearXiv:2304.03273v2  [cond-mat.mes-hall]  17 Aug 20232
representations (IRs) also exist in non-toroidal representation
spaces [10] and provide an ansatz for further eigenstates [12].
The characterization of hyperbolic band structures by topolog-
ical invariants therefore presents new opportunities and chal-
lenges. For one, higher-dimensional topological invariants
such as the second Chern number, conventionally incompati-
ble with 2D systems, become accessible within the higher 2 g-
dimensional momentum space [4]. On the other hand, there
exist2g
2
=g(2g−1)>1 first Chern numbers Ci j, one for each
subtorus ( ki,kj) of the hyperbolic BZ, despite the system be-
ing 2D in real space. This calls for a new interpretation to
relate the multiple first Chern numbers to observables such as
the Hall conductance or the number of chiral edge modes.
The principal results of our work include the systematic
mathematical characterization of Chern invariants in hyper-
bolic{p,q}lattices, as well as numerically determined phase
diagrams of hyperbolic Haldane models. Our analysis be-
gins in Sec. II with the construction of Haldane models on
finite portions of {p,q}hyperbolic lattices in the real coor-
dinate space, henceforth called hyperbolic flakes , for a large
selection of integers pandq. Using exact diagonalization,
we calculate the bulk density of states (bulk DOS) as a func-
tion of the hopping phase ϕfor generic parameter choices.
The bulk DOS of many {p,q}Haldane models exhibits gaps
in which real-space Chern numbers [43] are quantized to 1. In
addition, we observe an intriguing universality in a qualitative
feature of the DOS which is characterized solely by p, inde-
pendent of q. Namely, the peaks and valleys in the DOS are
centered around the same energies for models with the same
p. Lastly, we uncover a correlation between the topology of
hyperbolic Haldane models and the geometry of the underly-
ing lattices: Haldane models on weakly curved hyperbolic lat-
tices predominantly exhibit nontrivial topological gaps, while
those with strong curvature typically remain gapless.
In Sec. III we complement our real-space approach based
on hyperbolic flakes by studying hyperbolic Haldane mod-
els on{p,q}lattices with periodic boundary conditions us-
ing HBT. According to the automorphic Bloch theorem, the
eigenstates of such hyperbolic lattice models obey a Bloch
ansatz that is either Abelian [9] or non-Abelian [10]. In this
work, when applying HBT, we mean considering exclusively
the Abelian Bloch states ψk(z), which transform according to
1D IRs of the Fuchsian translation group:
ψk(γ−1
j(z))=eikjψk(z). (1)
Here,γjis a generator of the non-commutative transla-
tion group and the hyperbolic crystal momentum k=
(k1,..., k2g)⊤is an element from a higher-dimensional BZ 
[−π,+π]2g. Abelian Bloch states and the related notion of
hyperbolic crystallography are directly relevant to realistic
experimental realizations of finite hyperbolic lattices [1–5].
In Ref. 5, the Abelian Bloch spectrum was simulated using
tunable-phase circuit elements, and in Ref. 4, hyperbolic cir-
cuits were engineered with periodic boundary conditions de-
signed specifically to realize exclusively Abelian Bloch states.
In the present theoretical analysis, we focus on several hy-
perbolic lattices associated with small g=2 and g=3, which,respectively, possess 4D and 6D BZs. We tabulate the key in-
formation needed for implementing HBT in these lattices in
Table I and Fig. 5, both shown on page 8. Abelian Bloch
energy bands computed from HBT were previously found
to very accurately capture energy spectra of non-topological
nearest-neighbor tight-binding models on several hyperbolic
lattices [5, 32]. For the topological Haldane models, we find
that the Abelian DOS from HBT agrees equally well with the
real-space analysis, especially for lattices with weaker cur-
vature. We expect the remaining deviations to be mainly at-
tributable to non-Abelian Bloch states belonging to higher-
dimensional IRs of the Fuchsian symmetry. Such states are
present in the real-space lattices but are not captured in the
momentum space associated with HBT. Let us point out that
the characterization of non-Abelian Bloch states on hyper-
bolic lattices is a topic of active ongoing research [15, 18–20].
To characterize the topology of the hyperbolic Bloch bands
from the vantage point of HBT, we derive constraints on the
first and second Chern numbers on various subtori of the high-
dimensional BZ, which are imposed by crystalline symmetry.
The general form of these constraints appears in Eqs. (8–11),
and their specific application for Haldane models on {p,q}lat-
tices with g=2 and g=3 is summarized in Table II. Next,
we verify that the numerically computed first Chern numbers
at all observed gaps obey these symmetry constraints, and
that they match the real-space Chern numbers in cases where
there is a unique symmetry-inequivalent first Chern number.
All second Chern numbers are found to vanish for the hyper-
bolic Haldane models studied here, thus trivially satisfying
the derived constraints. We further compute phase diagrams
in terms of parameters t2andmat half-filling and at the max-
imally time-reversal-breaking magnetic flux ϕ=π/2, reveal-
ing additional insulating phases with Chern number 2. We
note in passing that the derived relations among the Chern
numbers potentially also apply to other platforms charac-
terized with a higher-dimensional BZ, such as superlattices
and quasicrystals [44–47], and systems with synthetic dimen-
sions [48–50].
Finally, before concluding the paper, we indicate in Sec. IV
how the symmetry analysis of momentum-space Chern num-
bers can be extended to Haldane-like models with a modified
pattern of alternating magnetic fluxes. In particular, we re-
veal certain flux patterns that possess a reflection (i.e., mir-
ror) symmetry, for which the symmetries allow for a non-
vanishing momentum-space Chern number while simultane-
ously imposing a strictly zero real-space Chern number. We
summarize our results with a discussion of open problems in
Sec. V, followed by Appendices A–F which provide detailed
mathematical derivations and a description of the numerical
algorithms supporting the discussions in the main text. Sup-
plementary code and data are available online as Ref. 51.
II. HYPERBOLIC HALDANE MODELS IN REAL SPACE
In this section, we analyze a large selection of {p,q}hyper-
bolic Haldane models in real space. In Sec. II A, we briefly de-
scribe the numerical procedure for constructing the hyperbolic3
FIG. 1. Hyperbolic Haldane models. Here we portray the tight-
binding Haldane model on the {6,4}lattice, with Hamiltonian given
by Eq. (2). The nearest-neighbor hopping is along the edges of the
lattice graph (in gray). The sublattices A and B are marked by black
and white circles. The second-neighbor hopping gains a phase +ϕ
along the red arrows, which are clockwise within the polygons. Phys-
ically, the hopping phases ±ϕcorrespond to perpendicular magnetic
fluxes which alternate in sign (symbols ⊗and⊙) across parts of the
polygon, and which add up to zero within each polygon.
flakes and the corresponding tight-binding Haldane models,
relegating details to Appendix A. In Sec. II B, we define and
compute the bulk DOS to identify bulk gaps induced by the
complex hopping terms. We observe bulk gaps in some of the
models, while others remain gapless. In Sec. II C, we compute
the real-space Chern numbers [43] at ϕ=π/2 and find that the
bulk gaps have Chern number 1. In Sec. II D, we infer an in-
verse correlation between the topology of hyperbolic Haldane
model and the Gaussian curvature of the underlying lattice.
A. Flake model construction
We generalize the Haldane model to various {p,q}hyper-
bolic lattices with the integer pranging from 5 to 12 and the
integer q<pranging from 3 to 6. Hyperbolic lattices with
p<5 are not suitable for realizing the Haldane model, as
the second-neighbor hoppings do not form closed paths inside
each tile. We further focus on lattices with q<7, as we ob-
serve that larger values of qsuppress gap opening from the
complex Haldane terms.
We numerically generate finite-sized flakes with open
boundary conditions on the Poincar ´e disk using the so-called
vertex-inflation tiling procedure [52]. For this, we start with
a central p-polygon, or tile, and then iteratively attach addi-
tional “rings” of tiles. At each iteration, we ensure that all
open vertices are each equipped with qadjacent tiles. We end
the iterative process when the number of sites reaches a value
between∼103to 104. For flakes constructed via vertex infla-
tion, it is natural to define the outermost ring as the boundary
and all the remaining inner rings as the bulk. The former is
known to realize a 1D quasicrystal with discrete conformalsymmetry [53].
Once the flakes are constructed, we use their adjacency
matrices and site coordinates to define the hyperbolic Hal-
dane models , which are tight-binding models with Hamilto-
nian given by

the arrows in Fig. 1), and mis the strength of the staggered on-

our convention, the sign in front of ϕis positive for clockwise

ues of pare not bipartite, in which case the staggered on-site
potential±mis omitted from the Hamiltonian (2). All numeri-
cal algorithms used for constructing the real-space hyperbolic
Haldane models are detailed in Appendix A.
B. Bulk DOS ρbulk(E,ϕ)
With only nearest-neighbor hoppings, t2=m=0, the bulk
DOS (defined below) is gapless. To identify bulk gaps in-
duced by a nonzero t2, we compute the DOS as a function of
energy Eand phaseϕwith tight-binding parameters initially
set to m=0 and t2=0.5. In order to minimize the boundary
contribution to the DOS, we define the bulk DOS as
ρbulk(E,ϕ)≡NX
j=1X
z∈Sbulk|ψj(z,ϕ)|2fη(E−εj), (3)
where Sbulkis the set of lattice sites in the bulk (consisting of
all the inner rings of the lattice obtained via vertex inflation),
Nis the number of sites in the flake, and ψj(z,ϕ) is a single-
particle eigenstate of Eq. (2) with eigenvalue εj. Further, we
utilize a Gaussian smearing function fη(ε)=1
η√
2πexp
−ε2

with parameter η=0.063 to obtain a smooth spectrum and
reduce finite-size e ffects [6]. A selection of numerically com-
puted functions ρbulk(E,ϕ) is shown in Fig. 2, plotted in red
tones (see Fig. 9 in Appendix A for the remaining figures).
In all{p,q}models considered, we observe an intriguing ϕ-
dependence of ρbulk(E,ϕ) reminiscent of Hofstadter’s butter-
fly. Interestingly, the functions ρbulk(E,ϕ) for Haldane mod-
els with the same value of pbear similar qualitative features
as regards the location of regions of low or vanishing DOS,
irrespective of the value of q. Such universality in the bulk
DOS characterized by palone is also observed in hyperbolic
Hofstadter butterflies [21], and even in the DOS of hyperbolic
tight-binding models with only nearest-neighbor hopping (see
Fig. 8 in Appendix A).4

hyperbolic Haldane models on flakes are shown here with ( t2,m)=(0.5,0). White pockets indicate potentially gapped regions. The real-space
Chern number Cr(µ) is computed at ϕ=π/2, with nonzero quantized Crplateaus (indicating Chern-insulator phases) observed in some of the

HBT DOS displays a good agreement with the flake bulk DOS, especially for lattices with weaker curvatures. In each identified gapped region
(marked by “×”), the first Chern numbers Ci jare computed on all subtori ( ki,kj) of the 4D or 6D hyperbolic BZ, and reduced by point-group
symmetry to one or two independent first Chern numbers (Sec. III C). In cases with only one independent first Chern number, the momentum-
space Chern numbers agree with the real-space Chern numbers. The HBT DOS for {8,4}and{12,4}are shown in Fig. 10, and do not exhibit
energy gaps.5
Low-DOS regions, visible as white pockets in Fig. 2 and
Fig. 9, are observed in some of the hyperbolic Haldane mod-
els. In particular,{p,3}models have the most distinguishable
low-DOS regions, which, however, shrink or vanish as qin-
creases. Note that ρbulk(E,ϕ) includes residual contributions
from the boundary modes leaking into the bulk of the flakes.
Therefore, we consider all white pockets with small but non-
vanishing bulk DOS as potentially fully gapped regions.
C. Real-space Chern numbers
We use Kitaev’s real-space Chern number [43] as a real-
space topological marker to determine the topology of the ob-
served low-DOS regions [6]. To that end, we first divide the
bulk region of a flake into three wedge-shaped regions A,B,
andC, arranged in counterclockwise order, and define the pro-
jector onto the Hilbert space spanned by the occupied states by
Pµ=X
En<µ|ψn⟩⟨ψn|, (4)
whereµis a chemical potential set to lie within the low-DOS
region. The real-space Chern number of the corresponding,
potentially insulating region is then given by
Cr(µ)=12πiX
a∈AX
b∈BX
c∈C(Pµ
abPµ
bcPµ
ca−Pµ
acPµ
cbPµ
ba).(5)
In systems with Euclidean translation symmetry, Cr(µ) be-
comes the momentum-space Chern number or TKNN invari-
ant [54] when expressed in the momentum representation.
One can further show that Cr(µ) is a topological invariant even
in the absence of Euclidean translation symmetry, such that it
is quantized in the infinite-system limit and independent of the
detailed shape of the regions A,B, and C[43].
If the system is not gapped at the chemical potential µ,
Cr(µ) can still be defined and computed, but is not quantized.
In particular, in a finite system, boundary states with long pen-
etration depth can trivialize Cr(µ). To minimize this e ffect, we
define the bulk and boundary regions so that the bulk region
is maximized without overlapping significantly with the sup-
ports of boundary states. Our definition of the boundary as
the last ring during vertex inflation leads to optimal real-space
Chern numbers in this sense. We compute Cr(µ) atϕ=π/2 for
(t2,m)=(0.5,0) in the hyperbolic Haldane models and show
the main results in Fig. 2. (The rest is shown in Fig. 9). We
observe quantized plateaus with Cr=1.0±0.1 in{p,3}mod-
els for 6≤p≤12 and in{p,4}models for 5≤p≤7.
This is a strong indication that the low-DOS regions in these
models represent Chern-insulating phases with a single chiral
edge mode. The remaining models considered do not exhibit
quantized Crplateaus, so we conclude that they are gapless.
We finally investigate the gap opened by nonzero matµ=0
andϕ=π/2 for the bipartite models. This gap is topologi-
cally trivial when t2=0. We find that those Haldane models
without topological gaps for ( t2,m)=(0.5,0) generally do not
exhibit nontrivial Crfor 0≤t2≤2 and m>0.

in units of the inverse squared lattice constant 1 /a2. Only those mod-
els with|κ|a2≲2 exhibit bulk gaps with nonzero quantized Cr(µ)
plateaus at ( t2,m,ϕ)=(0.5,0,π/2).
D. Correlation with curvature
By using the same hopping amplitudes t1andt2for all{p,q}
models in the analysis above, we implicitly assume that the
lattice constants aare the same in all models. The Gaussian
curvatureκof a{p,q}lattice is thus most appropriately mea-
sured in units of the inverse squared lattice constant:
κa2=−a2
R2=−

1+2|z1−z2|2
(1−|z1|2)(1−|z2|2)!!2
,(6)
whereRis the curvature radius and z1andz2are the Poincar ´e
disk coordinates of any two nearest neighbors, see Eqs. (A2)
and (A3).
In Fig. 3, we sort our hyperbolic Haldane models by in-
creasing curvature magnitude |κ|. Incidentally, the models in
which we observe Chern phases (marked by solid dots) are
the ones with weaker curvatures. Further study is required to
explain this correlation, conceivably in terms of the e ffect of
spatial curvature on the formation of anomalous cyclotron or-
bits [55]. Note that {p,3}lattices up to p=23 have smaller
curvatures than the {5,4}lattice, which is the least curved
{p,4}lattice. Therefore the {p,3}lattices are generally flatter
and more suitable candidates for realizing nontrivial Chern-
insulating phases in hyperbolic space.
III. HYPERBOLIC HALDANE MODELS
IN MOMENTUM SPACE
In this section, we study selected hyperbolic Haldane mod-
els from Sec. II using the perspective of HBT. In this ap-
proach, one first identifies the Bravais lattice or, equivalently,
the hyperbolic translation group of the corresponding {p,q}
lattice [9–11], together with its 1D IRs which are labelled6
by a momentum kresiding in a higher-dimensional BZ. We
provide a summary of selected aspects of hyperbolic crys-
tallography in Sec. III A, with the key information summa-
rized in Fig. 5 and Table I, while relegating further details
to Appendix C. In a second step, one uses these 1D IRs as
an ansatz to construct a family of eigenstates ψk, hyperbolic
Bloch states, to construct the Bloch Hamiltonian H(k) of the
system. The eigenvalues of H(k) are the Bloch energy bands
of the underlying model. The details of this construction,
together with a discussion of the computed DOS functions
and the identification of bulk energy gaps, are the subject of
Sec. III B.
Having constructed the Bloch Hamiltonians, we subse-
quently compute the momentum-space topology of the associ-
ated Bloch energy bands, namely their first and second Chern
numbers. We first analyze how the Chern numbers on the var-
ious subtori of the high-dimensional BZ are constrained by
the symmetry of the hyperbolic lattices. While first consider-
ations along those directions for the {8,3}lattice appeared in
Ref. 6, our present analysis, detailed in Appendices D and E,
provides a major generalization that encompasses all symme-
try generators of the seven {p,q}lattices considered within
the framework of HBT in this work. A summary of the anal-
ysis of these symmetry constraints appears in Sec. III C and
in Table II, with further details provided in Appendix F. Fi-
nally, in Sec. III D we numerically compute the momentum-
space Chern numbers of the hyperbolic Bloch eigenstates of
the Haldane models on the seven considered lattices. We ver-
ify that the explicitly computed Chern numbers respect the
theoretically predicted symmetry constraints, and we present
phase diagrams illustrating the dependence of the topological
invariants on the choice of parameters t2andmat half-filling.
A. Hyperbolic crystallography and band theory
Among the lattices considered in Sec. II, an HBT descrip-
tion with 4D or 6D BZs applies for {8,3},{6,4},{8,4},{10,5},
{7,3},{12,3}, and{12,4}[5, 9, 11, 12, 32]. These seven lat-
tices are thus amenable for a comparison of the real-space and
momentum-space topology, and thus will be our principal fo-
cus within the entire Sec. III.
The construction of the Bloch Hamiltonian for a given Hal-
dane model within HBT can be broken down into three prin-
cipal steps. First, given a {p,q}lattice, we specify its lattice
symmetry, which in mathematical terms is the so-called tri-
angle group ∆(2,q,p) [11]. In the present context, this group
adopts the role of a hyperbolic space group . The second step
is to identify its hyperbolic translation group T(2,q,p) de-
fined via the following attributes [11]: it is the ( i) largest
(ii) normal subgroup of ( iii) orientation-preserving transfor-
mations in ∆(2,q,p) that ( iv) contains no rotation elements.
While this identification has previously been carried out for
the{8,3},{8,4},{7,3},{12,4}, and{10,5}lattices [11], our
work extend this list to include also the {6,4}and{12,3}lat-
tices. In the last step, given the translation group, we construct
all its 1D IRs, which are labelled by a crystal momentum kin
a 4D or 6D BZ for the {p,q}lattices considered here. The
FIG. 4. Tessellation of the hyperbolic plane by Schwarz triangles
of∆(2,q,p), illustrated for p=8,q=4. Schwarz triangles come
in two orientations: positive (white) and negative (yellow). When
plotting the various {p,q}lattices (e.g., Fig. 5) we always position a
white Schwarz triangle such that ( i) theπ/pangle touches the center
of the Poincar ´e disk, and ( ii) theπ/2 angle is to the right horizontally.
We define reflections a,b,cand rotations P,Q,Rwith respect to this
particular Schwarz triangle. Specifically, cis the reflection across its
hypothenuse, and a(b) is the reflection across its horizontal (vertical)
edge. By composing pairs of reflections we obtain P,Q,R, which are
respectively the counter-clockwise rotations by 2 π/p, 2π/q,πabout
the triangle corners.
unit cells and generators for their translation groups are sum-
marized in Fig. 5, with certain supplementary information on
the group structure listed in Table I. In addition, for the sym-
metry analysis in Sec. III C, it is convenient to also perform a
fourth step: construct the hyperbolic point group P(2,q,p) as
the quotient of ∆(2,q,p) byT(2,q,p).
In Secs. III A 1–III A 3 below, we provide a basic descrip-
tion of these four steps, which is necessary to understand
how Chern numbers in hyperbolic Haldane models are con-
strained by lattice symmetry. We further provide a detailed
summary of the key notions of hyperbolic crystallography in
Appendix C 1, apply those ideas to the {6,4}and{12,3}lat-
tices in Appendices C 2 and C 3, and showcase the hyperbolic
point group of all seven lattices in Appendix C 4. Although
we focus on seven specific lattices in this paper, we stress that
all{p,q}lattices are amenable to an HBT description, albeit
with potentially higher-dimensional BZs (see Table III in Ap-
pendix C 1).
1. Hyperbolic space groups
The{p,q}lattice is invariant under the action of the so-
called triangle group ∆(2,q,p). This group is obtained by sub-
dividing each p-gon into 2 pright triangles known as Schwarz7
triangles , and considering the reflections (and their composi-
tions) across the edges of these triangles. A tessellation of the
hyperbolic plane with Schwarz triangles related by elements
of∆(2,q,p) for{p,q}={8,4}is shown in Fig. 4. The tri-
angles appear in two orientations. They have interior angles
π/2,π/q,π/pif read counter-clockwise for positively oriented
triangles, shown in white (resp. if read clockwise for nega-
tively oriented triangles, shown in yellow).
The generators of ∆(2,q,p) are reflections across the edges
of a given positively oriented Schwarz triangle. In our nota-
tion, we always take a(b) to be the reflection across the edge
of the Schwarz triangle whose adjacent angles are π/2 andπ/p
(π/q), and cto be the reflection across its hypotenuse. Rota-
tions around the corners of the Schwarz triangle are obtained
by composing the above reflections.1Namely R=ab,Q=
bc,P=caare respectively counterclockwise rotations by π,
2π/q, and 2π/paround the three corners of the Schwarz tri-
angle. We indicate the underlying Schwarz triangles for all
{p,q}lattices considered in Fig. 5.
The Haldane models (even for m=0) explicitly break cer-
tain lattice symmetries. Namely, the reflections a,b,c(and
all other orientation-reversing elements of the group) flip the
sign of the fluxes ±ϕ. This is corrected if each reflection
is composed with the antiunitary operation of time reversal
(T). Therefore, the symmetry M(2,q,p) of Haldane models
with m=0 is a magnetic hyperbolic space group generated
byTa,TbandTc. When one further assumes a sublat-
tice mass m,0, which is possible in models with peven,
then the reflection Taceases to be a symmetry. In its place,
one supplements the antiunitary generators TbandTcwith
(ca)2=:P2, which corresponds to a counter-clockwise 4 π/p-
rotation around a p-sided polygon. We denote the resulting
magnetic hyperbolic space group as eM(2,q,p).
2. Hyperbolic translation and point groups
In line with earlier works [9, 10, 32], we define the hy-
perbolic translation group T(2,q,p) as the largest torsion-
free normal subgroup of orientation-preserving elements in
∆(2,q,p). The unit cell is subsequently defined as the col-
lection of Schwarz triangles which tessellate the hyperbolic
plane without overlaps or gaps if translated by all elements
T(2,q,p). In the above specification of T(2,q,p), one needs
to clarify the meaning of the attributes ( i) “largest”, ( ii) “nor-
mal”, ( iii) “orientation-preserving”, and ( iv) “torsion-free”.
Starting with ( iv), note that a characteristic feature of any
translation group is the absence of elements of finite order,
which are elements g,1 such that gn=1 for some n>1,such as rotations and reflections. Elements of finite order are
also called torsion elements, and a group without torsion el-
ements is labelled torsion-free. For ( ii), the requirement to
be normal allows us to construct the hyperbolic point group
as the quotient P(2,q,p)= ∆(2,q,p)/T(2,q,p). The order,
i.e., number of elements, of the quotient is equal to the index
of the subgroup Tin∆. For ( iii) note that the triangle group
splits into transformations that either preserve or reverse ori-
entation, analogous to proper and improper rotations. Finally,
concerning ( i), it turns out that ∆(2,q,p) has an infinite num-
ber of torsion-free normal subgroups of finite index, a result
known as Fenchel’s conjecture [56–60]. The physical signif-
icance of this mathematical result is that all {p,q}lattices ad-
mit a Bravais lattice and a finite-order point group. We select
T(2,q,p) to be the largest such subgroup, i.e., of the smallest
index, such that the order of P(2,q,p) is smallest. We show
in Appendix C 1 that T(2,q,p) as defined above is generally
also the largest torsion-free normal subgroup of the magnetic
group M(2,q,p) and, for the lattices considered here, also of
eM(2,q,p).
To identify the hyperbolic translation group T(2,q,p) in
practice, we utilize a tabulated list of quotients of hyper-
bolic triangle groups that act on Riemann surfaces with genus
2≤g≤101 [61]. These quotients are exactly the (orientation-
preserving) hyperbolic point groups, and from the knowledge
of both P(2,q,p) and ∆(2,q,p) it is possible to reconstruct
the translation subgroup T(2,q,p). Furthermore, note that the
translation group partitions all sites of the hyperbolic lattice
into orbits. We define sites per unit cell by selecting for each
orbit under T(2,q,p) exactly one site which is located inside
the unit cell or on its boundary.
3. Hyperbolic Brillouin zones
The point group P(2,q,p) acts on the (cosets of) Schwarz
triangles that constitute the unit cell, which is a (not neces-
sarily regular) polygon with 2 eedges. The translation group
T(2,q,p) is generated by elements {γj}e
j=1which relate pairs of
edges of the unit cell. Identifying these pairs yields a Riemann
surface which is characterized by its genus g≤e/2.2Hy-
perbolic momenta correspond to fluxes that can be threaded
through the 2 gholes of the genus- gRiemann surface, imply-
ing the appearance of a 2 g-dimensional BZ of 1D IRs of the
translation group [9]. More precisely, given a model invariant
under T(2,q,p), every choice of a 2 g-component momentum
k∈BZ is an ansatz to construct eigenstates obeying certain
twisted boundary conditions across the eunit cell edge pairs.
1In this work, we always assume the left action of symmetry groups. In
particular, the product ghacts first with h, then with g.
2This follows from computing the Euler characteristic χof the compactified
unit cell, which has f=1 face, edistinct edges, and v=1+δvdistinct
vertices (where “1” is the smallest possible value, relevant if all unit cellvertices are identified as the same vertex). From the definition χ=f−e+v
combined with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem χ=2(1−g) one derives g=
e/2−δv/2.8
TABLE I. Translation group for the {p,q}lattices studied with HBT in Sec. III, with number of sites ( {p,q}vertices) per unit cell. The geometric
meaning of the generators {γj}e
j=1is shown in Fig. 5. The relators, products of generators set to unity in the respective translation group, imply
that momenta appearing in the 1D IRs γj7→eikjare constrained as listed. The linearly independent momenta determine the dimension of the
higher-dimensional BZ, which can be interpreted as the number 2 gof fluxes threaded through the non-contractible cycles of a compactified
unit cell. The compactification is achieved through identification of unit cell edges related by translation generators as shown in Fig. 5. The
last column identifies the resulting genus- gRiemann surface by either its name or the equation of its complex algebraic curve ( w,z∈C) [62].

FIG. 5. Unit cell (red contour) and sites per unit cell (red dots) for each of the hyperbolic {p,q}lattices (grey lines) investigated via HBT in
Sec. III. The white /yellow triangles are the Schwarz triangles of opposite orientations. The labels γ(−1)
j, 1≤j≤e, shown along the unit cell
boundary, indicate how the adjacent unit cells are reached from the outlined unit cell by acting with the generators of the translation groups.
The relators among the translation generators are listed in Table I. Identification of edges labelled by γjandγ−1
jresults in a compactified unit
cell, which is a Riemann surface with genus g=2 (leading to a 4D BZ) or g=3 (leading to a 6D BZ).9
It is important to note that simply representing the egener-
ators byγj7→eikjmay result in more momentum components
than can be fitted into a 2 g-dimensional BZ. The reason is that
the translation generators {γj}e
j=1are not independent, but con-
strained via relators , i.e., particular nontrivial compositions of
the generators that are equivalent to identity. By inspecting
the relators, it is possible to identify the 2 gindependent mo-
menta{kj}2g
j=1and to express the remaining momenta {kj}e
j=2g+1
as unique linear combinations of the previous ones [11].
Let us now summarize the main findings relevant for
the subsequent analysis of hyperbolic Haldane models. By
searching in Ref. 61, we find that the only {p,q}lattices
which admit a characterization via HBT with 4D BZ are
{8,3},{6,4},{8,4},{10,5},{6,6},{8,8}, plus their dual
lattices with exchanged p↔q. Those with 6D BZ are
{7,3},{12,3},{12,4},{14,7},{12,12}, plus their duals. Moti-
vated by Fig. 3, we limit our attention to seven of the listed
lattices which have a comparatively small curvature (for fixed
lattice constant), such as to be likely to support a gapped topo-
logical phase. Their hyperbolic translation groups T(2,q,p)
are specified in Table I and Fig. 5. More precisely, Fig. 5
illustrates the hyperbolic unit cell and the generators {γj}e
j=1
of each translation group. To complement this information,
Table I lists the relators of T(2,q,p), and indicates how the
substitution γj7→eikjresults in concrete expressions for the
momenta with j>2g.
The translation group and the Brillouin zone for {8,3},
{8,4},{10,5},{7,3}, and{12,4}have been introduced in
Ref. 11, whereas the HBT for {6,4}and{12,3}is developed
in Appendices C 2 and C 3. We note that Ref. 11 assumed
a different compactification of the unit cell edges for {7,3}
than that shown in our Fig. 5, resulting in a di fferent defini-
tion of momenta. However, this choice does not correspond
to choosing a normal subgroup T(2,3,7) of ∆(2,3,7), which
makes the construction of a point group impossible. In con-
trast, the definition of T(2,3,7) in the more recent Refs. 12
and 32 is compatible with ours. In addition to the main-text
discussion, Table III in Appendix C 1 lists all hyperbolic {p,q}
lattices which per our construction result in a 2 g-dimensional
BZ with 2≤g≤10. Additional discussion of the hyper-
bolic point groups for the seven lattices we study appears in
Appendix C 4, with key findings summarized in Table IV.
B. HBT model construction and DOS
The crystallography of a {p,q}hyperbolic lattice specifies a
Bravais unit cell with Nsites and a Fuchsian translation group
T(2,q,p) with generators {γj}e
j=1. The Fuchsian-group sym-
metry allows us to describe various tight-binding models on a
periodic{p,q}hyperbolic lattice by momentum-space Hamil-
tonians confined to the unit cell (see Ref. 5 and Supplemen-
tary Material therein for proof in the case of nearest-neighbor-
hopping models). With the Bloch ansatz, the momentum-
space Hamiltonians are N×Nmatrices in the position-state ba-
sis formed by the unit-cell sites. Hoppings within the unit-cell
are prescribed by the tight-binding model. Hopping from sitezain the unit cell to site zboutside of the unit cell is replaced by
hopping from zatozcin the unit cell multiplied by some phase
factor eif(k), where zbandzcbelong to the same orbit under
T(2,q,p) (i.e., the same equivalence class modulo all trans-
lations) [5, 6]. Specifically, to determine the function f(k),
one looks for the unique combination of generators γj1···γjn
(with possible repetitions) such that zb=γj1···γjnzc.3Repre-
senting each γjby its 1D IR eikj, one obtains
f(k)=nX
α=1kjα, (7)
which can be expressed in terms of the linearly independent
momenta through the relators in Table I. Using this approach,
we derive the momentum-space version of Eq. (2) for our
seven{p,q}lattices.
The DOS ρ(E,ϕ) of each HBT Haldane model at
(t2,m)=(0.5,0) is computed by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian
at each fixed ϕover a fine grid of momentum points ( ∼106
points) in the 4D or 6D hyperbolic BZ, then sorting all the
eigenvalues into histogram bins at di fferent energies. Fig-
ure 2 shows ρ(E,ϕ) for models{6,4},{7,3},{8,3},{10,5},
and{12,3}, while{8,4}and{12,4}are shown in Fig. 10 in the
Appendix. Models {7,3},{8,3}, and{12,3}exhibit distinc-
tive gapped regions at various filling fractions fand ranges of
ϕ, while{6,4},{8,4},{12,4}, and{10,5}appear gapless, only
showing regions of low DOS.
Comparing with the real-space analysis, the DOS of HBT
Haldane models{6,4},{7,3},{8,3}, and{12,3}demonstrate
excellent agreement with the bulk DOS of the corresponding
{p,q}models in the flake geometry, whereas there is a clear
disagreement in the cases of {8,4}and{10,5}. We expect the
discrepancy to be mainly attributable to the Abelian Bloch
ansatz [Eq. (1)] in our momentum-space analysis, whereas
the real-space models in the flake geometry also support non-
Abelian Bloch states transforming in higher-dimensional rep-
resentations [10, 12]. Incidentally, lattices {8,4}and{10,5}
have stronger Gaussian curvature κthan the other lattices. The
inverse correlation between curvature and agreement in the
DOS comparison (also observed in hyperbolic tight-binding
models with only nearest-neighbor hoppings [5]) calls for fu-
ture works to determine whether non-Abelian Bloch states
play an increasingly important role in the spectrum of periodic
lattices with stronger curvature. Crucial steps in this direction
have been achieved in very recent works [15, 18–20].
C. Symmetry constraints on Chern numbers
Having discussed hyperbolic band structures and the DOS,
we now turn our attention to momentum-space topological in-
3Searching for the unique combination of generators which translates site
ito site jcan be done either by hand with Fig. 5 or by numerical ground
search. The latter involves representing the generators by PSU (1,1) ma-
trices and applying arbitrary combinations of them to the Poincar ´e disk
coordinate of site i, until a specific combination is found to bring it to site
j(see Ref. 5 and Supplementary Material therein for examples).10
variants. In order to characterize the topology of gapped re-
gions, we need a way to identify the independent Chern num-
bers arising in the 4D and 6D hyperbolic BZs. We first dis-
cuss the case of first Chern numbers defined on 2D subtori of
the BZ, before later focusing on second Chern numbers de-
fined on 4D subtori of the BZ. The main text only presents
a brief summary of a mathematically rather involved discus-
sion whose details extend over Appendices D, E and F. These
detailed derivations and results constitute one of the major
achievements of our present work.
Given a gapped band structure in n-dimensional hypercubic
BZ, with n =2g, it is possible to define a first Chern number
Ci jon each 2D subtorus of the BZ spanned by two distinct
momentum coordinates ( ki,kj),i,j. We refer to them as the
coordinate subtori and we call Ci jthecoordinate Chern num-
bers. Note that exchanging i↔jresults in a change of ori-
entation on the coordinate subtorus, which (as discussed in
Appendix E 2) implies a sign flip, Cji=−Ci j. It is therefore
natural to arrange then
2
=n(n−1)/2 potentially distinct co-
ordinate Chern numbers into a skew-symmetric n ×n matrix,
which we label C(1). (Note that there are additional 2D sub-
spaces of an n-dimensional torus that are not (in the homotopi-
cal sense) deformable to any of the coordinate subtori; how-
ever, they can be decomposed (in a homological sense) into a
linear combination of the coordinate subtori. Therefore, the
Chern number on any such subspace is equal to a certain spe-
cific linear combination of the coordinate Chern numbers Ci j.)
If translations γiare the only symmetries of a model on a
hyperbolic lattice, then all the coordinate Chern numbers can
be tuned independently. However, the presence of additional
point-group symmetries is expected to significantly reduce the
number of independent coordinate Chern numbers. For exam-
ple, although the 4D BZ of the {8,3}-Haldane model contains
six coordinate subtori, it was shown in Ref. 6 that there are,
in fact, no more than three independent first Chern numbers.
Here, we complete the symmetry characterization of the {8,3}
Haldane model, and we generalize the arguments to Haldane
models on all hyperbolic {p,q}lattices listed in Fig. 5.
To proceed with the analysis, we utilize the fact, derived in
Appendix E 3, that in the presence of a symmetry g,
C(1)=ςgM⊤
gC(1)Mg (8)
where the point-group matrix Mgdescribes the transformation
of momentum k=(k1,k2,..., kn)⊤under the action of g, i.e.
k7→Mgk, and the sign ςg∈{+1,−1}is positive (negative)
if the symmetry is unitary (antiunitary). It is worth empha-
sizing that, somewhat non-intuitively, the hyperbolic point-
group matrices are not necessarily orthogonal (i.e., they may
not preserve angles) but rather are elements of the general lin-
ear group GL(n,Z). To obtain all the constraints on the first
Chern numbers, it is su fficient to study Eq. (8) for the genera-
tors of the symmetry group of the corresponding model; these
areaT,bT,cT(resp. P2,bT,cT) in the absence (presence)
of sublattice mass m.
To evaluate the implications of the above equation for the
various Haldane models, we first extract the point-group ma-
trices Mgfor each symmetry generator of a given {p,q}lat-
tice using computational group theory methods (Appendix D).TABLE II. Number of linearly independent first and second

Given those matrices, we then simplify the matrix C(1)via
Eq. (8). The resulting matrices C(1)for each hyperbolic
Haldane model considered are listed in Appendix F 1. The
(significantly reduced) information about the number of lin-
early independent coordinate Chern numbers for each Hal-
dane model is summarized in Table II.
We next discuss symmetry constraints on second Chern
numbers C(2),i jkℓdefined on 4D coordinate subtori spanned by
momenta ( ki,kj,kk,kℓ). In analogy with the previous case, the
exchange of any pair of momentum coordinates results in a re-
versed orientation on the 4D subtorus. Therefore, C(2),i jkℓflips
sign under the exchange of any two indices, and C(2)is best
interpreted as a fully skew-symmetric fourth-rank tensor. As
for the number of independently defined components C(2),i jkℓ,
for models with 4D BZ there is a unique 4D subtorus (the
whole BZ), whereas for a 6D BZ there are6

choices specified by the two momentum coordinates that do
not appear among ( ki,kj,kk,kℓ). In both cases, the reduction

hand side is implicitly assumed. The dual C(2)is a single num-
ber for a 4D BZ and a skew-symmetric matrix with compo-
nentsCi j
(2)for a 6D BZ.
Similar to the case of first Chern numbers, point-group
symmetries may reduce the number of linearly independent
second Chern numbers. Let us first consider models with 4D
BZ before discussing the ones with 6D BZ. We derive in Ap-
pendix E 4 that the sole independent second Chern number in
a 4D BZ is constrained by
C(2)=(detMg)C(2) (10)
in the presence of a (unitary or antiunitary) symmetry g. In
particular, the presence of any symmetry with det Mg=−1
implies that the second Chern number must vanish. By check-
ing the point-group matrices listed in Appendix D, we find
that det Mg= +1 for all symmetry generators of the hyper-
bolic Haldane models with 4D BZ ( {8,3},{6,4},{8,4}, and11
{10,5}). This implies that these models are compatible with a
nonzero value of C(2).
For models with 6D BZ, we derive in Appendix E 4 that
C(2)=(detMg)MgC(2)M⊤
g (11)
in the presence of a (unitary or antiunitary) symmetry g, where
C(2)is now a skew-symmetric 6 ×6 matrix. The form of
Eq. (11) crucially di ffers from that of Eq. (8) in where the
transpose (⊤) is located. Given the point-group matrices,
which are derived in GAP [64] and presented in Appendix D,
we again evaluate the consequences of Eq. (11) for hyperbolic
Haldane models. We list the resulting symmetry-constrained
matrices of second Chern numbers for the respective models
in Appendix F 2, and indicate the number of linearly indepen-
dent second Chern numbers in the last column of Table II .
D. Chern numbers and phase diagrams
1. First Chern numbers
We compute the first Chern numbers in the observed
gapped regions of Fig. 2 using an e fficient numerical method
adapted from Ref. 65 (see Appendix B 2 for details). In the
4D/6D hyperbolic BZ, we explicitly compute the coordinate
Chern numbers Ci jon six /fifteen coordinate subtori spanned
by momenta ( ki,kj) and verify their relationships obtained by
the symmetry analysis above. The remaining independent first
Chern numbers are listed alongside the DOS plots in Fig. 2.
In cases where there is only one independent first Chern num-
ber, the momentum-space Chern numbers agree with the real-
space Chern numbers of the corresponding {p,q}flake mod-
els. The HBT DOS of {7,3}additionally reveals two small
gapped regions with C13=±2 indistinguishable in the bulk
DOS of the flake model.
The low-DOS regions in models {6,4},{8,4}, and{10,5}
are not fully gapped, so here we expect each Ci jto depend on
the choice of the fixed momentum components kh,i,j, which
can be thought of as tuning parameters. Nevertheless, we
notice that the Ci j’s of model{6,4}at half-filling are inde-
pendent of the fixed momenta, indicating an accidental band-
touching region where no topological phase transition occurs.
The band-touching points are located at ( π,π, 0,π), (π,0,π,π ),
and (0,π,π, 0) for ( t2,m,ϕ)=(0.5,0,π/2). This semimetal-
lic phase turns into a Chern insulator of topological charge 1
upon the introduction of an infinitesimal sublattice mass m.
The absence of sublattice mass in the experimental realization
of the{6,4}Haldane model in Ref. 3 leads us to hypothesize
that the topological gap observed at half-filling is a finite-size
effect.
2. Phase diagrams
In the bipartite lattices, a nonzero sublattice mass mopens
a trivial gap at half-filling when t2=0. Turning on the

{6,4}based on the first Chern number C12on the BZ subtorus
spanned by momenta ( k1,k2). We compute C12at various fixed mo-
menta ki,1,2. If multiple distinct values are obtained, it can be in-
ferred that the system is gapless. On the other hand, a unique result
does not guarantee a gapped phase. We superimpose the numerically
estimated gap size ∆over the phase diagram, which is marked by
white with linearly varying opacity (solid at ∆ =0 and transparent at
∆ = 0.1). This allows us to distinguish semimetals with trivial gap-
less regions from gapped phases. The hyperbolic Haldane models
exhibit an extended gapless phase, which, in the cases of {8,3}and
{6,4}, separates the trivial and nontrivial gapped phases.
phase transition into a Chern insulator, as seen in the {6,3}
Haldane model [41]. We investigated the interplay between
mandt2in hyperbolic Haldane models through their phase
diagrams over parameter space ( t2,m)∈[0,1]×[0,1], gen-
erated from the first Chern numbers. The phase diagrams of
models{8,3}and{6,4}are shown in Fig. 6. They reveal ex-
tensive gapless regions (unlike in the {6,3}honeycomb lat-
tice [41]) and Chern-insulating phases. Specifically, a point
on the phase diagram is gapless (colored white) if the coordi-
nate Chern number C12varies over a random sampling of the
fixed momentum components ki,1,2, indicating a topological
phase transition somewhere in the BZ. A unique C12indicates
either a gapped phase or a gapless phase with an accidental
band-touching region. Therefore we superimpose the numer-
ically estimated gap size ∆over the phase diagram, which is
marked by white with linearly varying opacity – solid at ∆ =0
and transparent at ∆ =0.1.
Interestingly,{8,3}exhibits gapped phases with Chern
number±2, albeit the gaps there are small (less than 5% of the
bandwidth). We also find that the {6,4}model is a semimetal
atm=0 and t2≳0.2. The phase diagrams of models {8,4},
{10,5}, and{12,3}(not shown) contain a trivially gapped re-
gion and a gapless region; the latter remains gapless even with
t2increased to 10.
3. Second Chern numbers
The 4D /6D hyperbolic band structures can be further char-
acterized by higher-dimensional topological invariants. We
computed the second Chern numbers using the approach of
Ref. 66 (see Appendix B 3 for details) and found C(2)=0 in
all observed gaps and on all 4D subtori. We conclude that the
hyperbolic Haldane models generally do not exhibit nontrivial12
second Chern numbers.
IV . FLUX PATTERNS AND
MAGNETIC HYPERBOLIC SPACE GROUPS
While Sec. III C contains a complete discussion of symme-
try constraints on momentum-space Chern numbers for hy-
perbolic Haldane models, the presented symmetry-centered
techniques are even more powerful as they can also be ap-
plied to study models symmetric under other magnetic sym-
metry groups on{p,q}lattices. In fact, we have discussed
in Sec. III A that when constructing the Haldane models,
one replaces the generators a,b,cof the symmetry group
∆(2,q,p) by aT,bT,cT, resulting in a particular type-III
magnetic [67, 68] hyperbolic space-group symmetry.4A sim-
ple and straightforward generalization is o ffered by compos-
ing only some of the three symmetry generators with time re-
versal symmetry, which results in Haldane-like models with
modified magnetic flux patterns. By properly adapting our
analysis, we find that some of these generalized models fa-
cilitate unusual topological features where symmetry enforces
the real-space Chern number to vanish while allowing for non-
vanishing Chern numbers in the momentum space. For sim-
plicity, in this section we set the sublattice mass mto zero.
To characterize these generalized flux patterns, we intro-
duce three Z2-valued quantities sa,b,c∈{±1}as follows:
•sj= +1 if the generator j∈{a,b,c}in the presentation
of the model’s symmetry group is composed with time
reversalT; therefore, the reflection through edge jis
antiunitary [ ςjT=−1 in Eq. (8)].
•sj=−1 if the generator j∈{a,b,c}in the presentation
of the model’s symmetry group is notcomposed with
T, so that the reflection through edge jis unitary [ςj=
+1 in Eq. (8)].
In both cases, if Φis the magnetic flux through a selected
Schwarz triangle [yellow in Fig. 7(a)], the flux through the
Schwarz triangle related by jis given by sjΦ. With our defi-
nitions, it always holds that “ ς=−s”.
Note that not all combinations of sa,b,c=±1 are avail-
able on all{p,q}lattices. In particular, the flux through a
Schwarz triangle related by2π
q-rotation around the vertex (ro-
tation Q=bcin Fig. 4) equals sbscΦ. Therefore, consistency
requires that sbsc= +1 ifqis odd. Similarly, the flux through
a Schwarz triangle related by2π
p-rotation around the p-sided
polygon (rotation P=cain Fig. 4) equals scsaΦ, and consis-
tency requires that scsa= +1 ifpis odd. For simplicity, we
here explicitly consider the application to the {6,4}lattice, for
which both pandqare even. Then, the two above restrictions
do not arise, and all 23=8 combinations of sa,b,c=±1 are
4Starting with a non-magnetic space group Gand its index-two subgroup
H, a type-III magnetic space group is constructed as MIII=H∪T(G\H)
whereTis the time-reversal operator.allowed.5Haldane models, whose flux pattern is illustrated
in Fig. 1, correspond to the choice sa,b,c=1. Two of the
generalized Haldane models that carry a modifed flux pattern,
with an indicated orientation of magnetic field through parts
of four adjacent hexagons of the {6,4}lattice, are illustrated
in Fig. 7(b,c).
It is generally understood that reflection symmetry, which
flips orientation in a 2D system, enforces the real-space Chern
number Cr(µ) to vanish. This property relates to the fact
that the Chern number measures a chiral response, and that
chirality is flipped under reflections. In our model, set-
ting either of sa,b,cto−1 implies the presence of the cor-
responding reflection symmetry, thus enforcing Cr(µ)=0
at all chemical potentials µ. Note that in 2D Euclidean lat-
tices, the sole momentum-space Chern number is equal to the
real-space Chern number [43]. Therefore, reflections in Eu-
clidean lattices also imply vanishing of the momentum-space
Chern number. However, in hyperbolic lattices, the correspon-
dence between real-space and momentum-space Chern num-
bers is presently not known. Therefore, it is not a priori clear
whether reflection symmetry on a hyperbolic lattice also im-
plies vanishing of momentum-space Chern numbers C(1),i jon
the subtori of the higher-dimensional hyperbolic BZ.
The question is resolved by analyzing the implications of
Eq. (8) with adjusted choices of ςg. Our analysis, detailed in
Appendix F 3, suggests that in hyperbolic lattices it is possi-
ble to have non-vanishing Chern numbers C(1),i jon some 2D
subtori in momentum space even in the presence of reflection
symmetry , in sharp contrast with the Euclidean case. Specif-
ically, the choices ( sa,sb,sc) being either ( +,−,+), (+,−,−)
or (−,+,+) [of which the first and the last are illustrated
in Fig. 7(c) resp. (b)] possess orientation-reversing reflection
symmetries while admitting one independent first Chern num-
ber in momentum space, with the explicit form of the Chern-
number matrices shown in Eqs. (F17–F19) in Appendix F 3.
We anticipate models with such magnetic hyperbolic space-
group symmetry to provide a fruitful ground for investiga-
tions of the bulk-boundary correspondence associated with
momentum-space Chern numbers in the higher-dimensional
BZs, since their responses and spectra should not be contami-
nated by chiral edge states originating from a real-space Chern
number.
V . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
In summary, we have generalized the Haldane honeycomb-
lattice model to a wide range of regular {p,q}hyperbolic lat-
tices and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its symmetry
5In addition, all eight options are compatible also with the translation group
given in Table I. To reveal this, note that in Appendix C 2 we express a
representative element of the translation group as γ1=(QP−1)2=(bcac )2.
Since this product contains an even number of each generator a,b,c, it
follows that any pair of Schwarz triangles related by γ1carry the same
magnetic flux irrespective of signs sa,b,c, in accordance with the translation
symmetry.13

FIG. 7. Magnetic flux patterns in generalized Haldane models. (a) If the magnetic flux through a chosen Schwarz triangle (yellow) is Φ, then
the flux through the three adjacent Schwarz triangles of opposite orientation (white) is sjΦ, where j∈{a,b,c}are the three reflections in Fig. 4,
which generate the hyperbolic space group ∆(2,q,p), and sj= +1 (−1) if reflection jis composed (is not composed) with time reversal T.
(b,c) Magnetic flux patterns through four adjacent hexagons of the {6,4}lattice, which result in particular instances of the generalized Haldane
model, with their signs sa,b,c∈{±1}indicated at the top of each panel. Both illustrated flux configurations exhibit a reflection symmetry, which
enforces a vanishing real-space Chern number; yet, these symmetries permit non-vanishing Chern numbers in the hyperbolic momentum space.
and topology. In Sec. II, we numerically constructed the tight-
binding Haldane models on hyperbolic flakes embedded in the
Poincar ´e disk. Given that the boundary of a hyperbolic flake
constitutes a substantial portion of the system, we devised and
computed the bulk DOS to extract the bulk physics. By plot-
ting the bulk DOS as a function of the time-reversal-breaking
magnetic flux ϕ, we observed that certain models exhibit bulk
gaps characterized by first Chern number 1, as indicated by
the quantized plateaus in the real-space Chern number com-
puted at all chemical potentials. Other models remain gapless,
apart from the trivial gap at half-filling if the sublattice mass
is nonzero.
To shed light on the underlying cause of the selective gap
opening in only certain {p,q}models, we computed the Gaus-
sian curvature of the hyperbolic lattices and observed a trend
where only lattices with weaker curvature give rise to topolog-
ically nontrivial Haldane models. In particular, Fig. 3 suggests
a curvature-driven phase transition from the Chern-insulating
phase to the gapless phase. However, it remains to be studied
why the formation of energy gaps appears more unlikely for
tight-binding models in strongly curved hyperbolic lattices.
Notably, a similar curvature-induced spectral transition in hy-
perbolic lattices was reported for the Hofstadter spectra [21].
In that work, the spectral transition was related to attributes
of classical trajectories of charged particles, which in 2D hy-
perbolic space are open in weak magnetic fields [55], whereas
they always constitute closed cyclotron orbits in 2D Euclidean
space. It is tempting to ponder an adaptation of this argument
for Chern insulators; however, that would require a meaning-
ful formulation of cyclotron orbits in the absence of externally
applied magnetic fields. In addition, the present scenario is
complicated by the following aspect: while usually one con-
siders topological phase transitions at one particular gap, the
{p,q}Haldane models studied here exhibit qualitatively dif-
ferent band structures for various choices of p, and their topo-
logical gaps arise at various filling fractions. We leave a more
careful study of this curvature-driven transition to future in-vestigations.
In Sec. III, we provided a detailed formulation of hyper-
bolic crystallography and band theory, which can be straight-
forwardly generalized to all regular {p,q}lattices beyond
those explicitly considered in this work. In particular, we
present a previously missing construction of hyperbolic point
groups and the hyperbolic crystallography of lattices {6,4}and
{12,3}, which do not fall into any of the infinite families of
{p,q}lattices discussed in Ref. 11. Having obtained the hy-
perbolic Bravais lattices and unit cells, we employ the Bloch
ansatz to construct Bloch Hamiltonians H(k) with momentum
kresiding in the 4D and 6D hyperbolic BZs. The DOS com-
puted from the Bloch Hamiltonians agrees with the bulk DOS
of finite-sized models in the flake geometry, except for lat-
tices with strong curvatures. We therefore anticipate that the
contribution of non-Abelian states to the spectrum of finite
hyperbolic flakes becomes increasingly prevalent for strongly
curved{p,q}lattices, although a careful examination of this
question remains open for future studies.
To investigate the hyperbolic band topology, we derived
constraints on the multiplet of first Chern numbers arising
from the high-dimensional BZs by considering the hyper-
bolic point-group symmetry. Subsequently, we numerically
computed the first and second Chern numbers on various 2D
and 4D subtori in the BZs. We found that the numerically
computed first Chern numbers satisfy the analytically derived
symmetry constraints. Furthermore, in models where only
one independent first Chern number remains after the sym-
metry constraints, the momentum-space and real-space first
Chern numbers were observed to agree. The physical mean-
ing of having more than one independent first Chern number
in a 2D lattice requires future investigations. We also demon-
strated that the Bloch Hamiltonians facilitate an e fficient com-
putation of the phase diagrams, resulting in the presented plots
of the first Chern numbers as a function of second-neighbor
hopping t2and sublattice mass m, and revealing nontrivial
phases with Chern number 2.14
In addition, we analytically derived the anticipated con-
straints from hyperbolic point-group symmetry on the mul-
tiplet of second Chern numbers. However, the second Chern
numbers are trivial for all the presently considered hyperbolic
Haldane models; therefore, we were not able to illuminate
these constraints with explicit numerical data. It would be of
much theoretical interest to devise a general mechanism, ex-
tending the generation of k-dependent Haldane mass term via
second-neighbor hopping in the presence of staggered mag-
netic field [41], that would produce tight-binding models with
non-trivial second (rather than first) Chern numbers on a range
of hyperbolic{p,q}lattices. Let us remark that the derived
relations between Chern numbers, encompassed by Eqs. (8–
11) are, in principle, also applicable to any system with space
group symmetry acting in a four- (or higher-) dimensional mo-
mentum space. Such topological Bloch Hamiltonians are not
restricted to hyperbolic {p,q}lattices, but also arise in certain
quasicrystalline and superlattice models [44–47] and in mod-
els with synthetic dimensions [48–50]. A four-dimensional
topological lattice can also be directly realized as an electric-
circuit network [69].
In Sec. IV, we introduced the notion of magnetic hyperbolic
space groups, in analogy with the magnetic space groups of
Euclidean lattices [67]. In particular, while the Haldane mod-
els are naturally captured by certain type-III [68] magnetic
groups, simple modifications of the magnetic flux pattern over
the{p,q}lattice result in models symmetric under other type-
III magnetic groups. Curiously, while reflection symmetry in
2D Euclidean lattices implies a vanishing of the real-space and
momentum-space Chern numbers, which on a flat lattice are
equal to each other [43], we identified concrete magnetic sym-
metries on the{6,4}lattice where reflection symmetry appears
to be compatible with a non-vanishing first Chern number on
2D subtori of the 4D hyperbolic BZ. We anticipate such mod-
els to provide a fruitful playground for disentangling the bulk-
boundary correspondence associated with momentum-space
Chern numbers from that of the real-space Chern number.
Experimentally, while hyperbolic tight-binding models
with only nearest-neighbor hopping are straightforward to im-
plement using existing techniques of circuit QED and topolec-
trical circuitry, the complex-valued second-neighbor hopping
in the hyperbolic Haldane models requires additional engi-
neering. A complex-phase coupling between circuit nodes
has been achieved in topolectrical circuits in Refs. 3 and 5.
In particular, the authors of Ref. 3 fabricated a circuit real-
ization of the{6,4}hyperbolic Haldane model and observed
chiral edge modes robust against back-scattering, which ac-
cording to the bulk-boundary correspondence, is equivalent to
a measurement of the bulk Chern topology. Going forward,
hyperbolic Haldane models may be realizable by genuinely
quantum-mechanical platforms, such as circuit QED equipped
with complex-phase coupling and superconducting qubits [1].
With the rapidly developing techniques of optical tweezer ar-
rays [70, 71], which provide exceptional control and versatil-
ity in lattice engineering, realizations of hyperbolic Haldane
models in optical lattices may also be possible in the foresee-
able future.
Finally, we briefly comment on the thermodynamic limit,which has been the subject of very recent works [18–20]. As
shown in these studies, this limit can be approached by con-
sidering a suitably converging sequence of finite periodic clus-
ters. From the HBT point of view, non-Abelian Bloch states
belonging to increasingly high-dimensional IRs of the transla-
tion group are expected to play an increasingly important role
as this sequence progresses: an IR of dimension dappears d
times in the spectrum [10], and the allowed values of dgrow
with the system size. Abelian HBT can in fact be used to
systematically explore non-Abelian Bloch states, by applying
it to unit cells larger than the fundamental cell [15]. In this
regard, it would also be interesting to study how the number
of independent first and second Chern numbers in momen-
tum space (listed for the considered Haldane models in Ta-
ble II) changes with the choice of the unit cell, and whether
such considerations shed light on a prospective exact corre-
spondence between real-space and momentum-space Chern
numbers. We also note that while of mathematical interest,
the thermodynamic limit is not directly relevant to real ex-
periments such as those of Refs. 1–4, which contain at most
a few hundred sites. In fact, the finite size was exploited in
Ref. [4] to directly implement periodic boundary conditions
in the laboratory, leading to the experimental realization of
both Abelian and non-Abelian Bloch states.

Appendix A: Hyperbolic Haldane models on flakes
In the following, we describe numerical algorithms for con-
structing (1) the adjacency matrix Aof any finite{p,q}lattice,
(2) the Poincar ´e disk coordinates of the lattice sites, (3) the di-
agonal matrixMSfor assigning a staggered on-site potential,
such thatMS,ii=1 for i∈sublattice AandMS,ii=−1 for
i∈sublattice B, and (4) the “arrow” matrix MH, defined as
MH,i j=1 for all second-neighbor pairs ( i,j) such that the
arrow going from itojis clockwise within the polygon con-
taining iand j(MH,i j=0 otherwise). The single-particle
Hamiltonian of the Haldane model on a finite flake with N
sites in the position basis is then given by the N×Nmatrix
HH(m,t1,t2,ϕ)=t1A+t2(eiϕMH+e-iϕMT
H)+mMS.(A1)
All Hamiltonians generated in this work are available in the
Supplementary Code and Data [51].
1.{p,q}adjacency matrices
There are two methods for numerically “growing” finite-
sized{p,q}lattices: edge inflation and vertex inflation [52].
The two procedures are equivalent when q=3. Vertex in-
flation results in a smoother boundary for q≥4, so it is the
method of choice in this work. In the following we first de-
scribe the numerical algorithm for edge inflation because it
serves as a basis for the algorithm of vertex inflation.
a. Edge inflation
The adjacency matrix of a finite-sized {p,q}lattice is an
N×NmatrixA, where Nis the number of existing sites and
Ai j=Aji=1 if and only if site iandjare nearest neighbors;
otherwiseAi j=Aji=0. Every time we create a site, we add
a row and a column to A; to create an edge between sites i
and j, we add 1 toAi jandAji. We start with a p-polygon,
or tile, at the center of the Poincar ´e disk, and then iteratively
attach rings of tiles to the open edges , which are the edges
that belong to only one tile. Specifically, to attach the ( n+1)th
ring, we reflect the tiles in the nthring across the open edges.
After attaching each ring, some sites end up with more than q
neighbors. There are only two possible scenarios: site zhas
either q+1 orq+2 neighbors. To remove the extra neighbors,
we take two adjacent tiles containing site zin the ( n+1)thring,
and then either merge their adjacent, open edges into one edge
(reducing one neighbor in the former scenario) or merge the
two tiles into one tile (reducing two neighbors in the latter
scenario). We perform the merging procedure after attaching
each ring.
b. Vertex inflation
Each iteration in the above procedure leaves many open
vertices , which are the vertices with less than qneighbors.On the other hand, vertex inflation demands every ( n+1)th
ring to contain all the tiles required to fill all the open vertices
in the nthring, resulting in a lattice without any open vertices
in the bulk (inner rings). To construct the ( n+1)thring by
vertex inflation, first we identify the list Lof open vertices as
all those contained in the boundary of the nthring,6and then
perform the following steps in a while-loop:
1. For every open edge7eithat contains some vertex in L,
identify the tile containing eiand invert it over ei.
2. Merge any duplicated tiles by the same merging proce-
dure used in edge inflation.
3. Remove any filled vertices from L.
The while-loop ends when Lis empty, and the ( n+1)thring
is completed. One can attach arbitrarily many rings, limited
only by computational resources.
The DOS distributions of various hyperbolic flakes gener-
ated by vertex inflation are shown in Fig. 8.
2. Poincar ´e disk coordinates
While the adjacency matrix alone is often su fficient for con-
structing various tight-binding models and computing energy
spectra, it is useful to assign Poincar ´e disk coordinates to the
sites. In this work we need them for identifying the correct
second-nearest neighbors according to the hyperbolic distance
and computing the real-space Chern numbers. The site coor-
dinates of the central polygon are given by
zn=r0ei2πn/p,n=1,..., p, (A2)
where
r0=s
cos(π/p+π/q)
cos(π/p−π/q). (A3)
To invert a site z=zx+izyacross an edge{u=ux+iuy,v=
vx+ivy}, we first determine whether {u,v}is a straight segment
(i.e., along the radial direction) or a circular arc. If uxvy−
uyvx=0,{u,v}is along the radial direction, and the inverted
point is given by
z′=
zx(a2−b2)−2abz y
+i
−zy(a2−b2)−2abz x
a2+b2(A4)
where a=ux−vxandb=vy−uy. Ifuxvy−uyvx,0,{u,v}is
a circular arc whose orthocenter is given by
C{u,v}=
αvy+u2
yvy−βuy
+i
−αvx−u2
yvx+βux
2(uxvy−uyvx)=Cx+iCy
(A5)
6It is insu fficient to let open vertices be the ones with less than qneighbors,
since an open vertex can have qneighbors but not qtiles.
7The list of open edges is constantly updated throughout the script.16
FIG. 8. DOS for nearest-neighbor-hopping models. The DOS of tight-binding models constructed on various {p,q}flakes share similar
qualitative features in the location of high-DOS and low-DOS regions among models with the same p. Here we show the total DOS of {p,q}
models with only nearest-neighbor hopping t1=−1. Such universality is also observed in hyperbolic Hofstadter butterflies [21] and the DOS
of hyperbolic Haldane models (Fig. 2 in the main text).
whereα=1+u2

The inverted point is then given by
z′=Cx+iCy+R2(zx−Cx)+i(zy−Cy)
(zx−Cx)2+(zy−Cy)2. (A7)
Note that the merging procedure described earlier is equiva-
lent to removing sites at the same coordinates. One can alter-
natively eliminate extra neighbors by identifying sites with the
same coordinates. However this method is more computation-
ally expensive and prone to numerical rounding error for large
systems in which near-boundary sites are very close together.3. Sublattice mass
We introduce a staggered on-site potential, known as the
sublattice mass in the case of graphene, on bipartite lattices.
Identification of the sublattices can be done using graph the-
ory. The degree matrix, defined as
D=diagX
iAi j, (A8)
is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal element Dj jspecifies the
number of nearest neighbors of site j. On the other hand, the
square of the adjacency matrix, ( A2)i j, gives the number of
length-2 hops between sites iandj. Since a particle can triv-
ially hop two steps back to itself by passing through a nearest
neighbor, the matrix Sof neighbors that are two hops away is17
the di fference
S=A2−D. (A9)
It is a matrix of 0’s and 1’s because there is a unique two-hop
path between any two second-nearest neighbors. Shas two
connected components—corresponding to two sublattices—
which can be identified using graph-theoretic subroutines
available in Python’s scipy library and M athematica . An al-
ternative way to identify the two sublattices is to compute the
eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of S. This eigenvector is
anti-ferromagnetic in the sense that it is positive on one sub-
lattice and negative on the other. We then define the diagonal
matrixMSsuch thatMS,ii=1 if site iis in the first sublattice
andMS,ii=−1 if site iis in the second sublattice.
4. Haldane hopping
We want to introduce complex hopping terms e±iϕbetween
all second-nearest neighbors. For {p,3}lattices, the second-
neighbor pairs are readily encoded in the matrix S. However,
for lattices with q>3, not all sites which are two hops away
are second-nearest neighbors. In a {p,q}graph, each site has
q(q−1) sites that are two hops away. However if we con-
sider the geometry of the lattice, a site z0is shared among q
polygons, and within each polygon, z0has two second-nearest
neighbors, resulting in a total of 2 qsecond neighbors. Since
q(q−1)>2qforq>3, we must check the hyperbolic distanced(zi,zj) between sites iandj, given by
d(zi,zj)=Rarcosh 
1+2|zi−zj|2
(1−|zi|2)(1−|zj|2)!
, (A10)
whereRis the curvature radius, to see if they are second
neighbors. Specifically, for sites iand jsuch thatSi j=1,
we resetSi j=0 ifd(zi,zj),d(r0,r0ei4π/p).
Next, we assign “arrows” between all pairs of second neigh-
bors which represent the positive hopping direction. The ar-
rows must be consistently clockwise within each polygon.
Consequently, the arrows at each site go in-and-out in an al-
ternating fashion (as one can see in Fig. 1 by focusing on one
particular site), and we will use this observation in the follow-
ing arrow-assigning algorithm. We start with a site in the cen-
tral polygon z1=r0ei2π/p, and define the first arrow to go from
z3=r0ei6π/ptoz1, denoted by−−→z3z1. The second neighbors of
z1arezisuch thatS1i=1. We identify their relative positions
from one another using graph theory. In particular, two sec-
ond neighbors αandβofz1are “next to” each other among all
second neighbors of z1if and only if αandβare either 2 hops
or (p−4) hops away (without passing through z1). Knowing
their relative positions and the initializing arrow−−→z3z1, we can
then assign all the second-neighbor arrows of z1in an in-and-
out fashion. Subsequently we repeat the above procedure over
all sites, starting with sites with at least one known second-
neighbor arrow. Eventually all the arrows will be assigned
consistently within a sublattice (including the boundary re-
gion where sites do not have all 2 qsecond neighbors). If the
lattice has a single sublattice, then the arrow assignment is
over. If the lattice is bipartite, we run another arrow-assigning
algorithm with the initializing site z2=r0ei4π/pand arrow−−→z4z2
going from z4=r0ei8π/ptoz2. All arrows are then recorded in
a matrixMHsuch thatMH,i j=1 if there exists an arrow−−→zizj
andMH,i j=0 otherwise.
In Figs. 2 and 9, we show the bulk-DOS of the Haldane
model in Eq. (A1) implemented on various hyperbolic flakes.18

Appendix B: Computation of momentum-space Chern numbers
1. Hyperbolic Bloch Hamiltonians
A brief description of our construction of hyperbolic Bloch
Hamiltonians is included in Sec. III B of the main text. Here,we provide the explicit Hamiltonian matrices for three se-
lected ones, namely {6,4},{8,4}, and{10,5}. All Hamilto-

For the{6,4}lattice, there are 6 sites per hyperbolic unit cell. We label the six sites by 1 ≤j≤6 according to the translation
γjappearing at the nearest unit cell edge in Fig. 5. With this labelling, and with the sign convention for the staggered fluxes
shown in Fig. 1, the hyperbolic Bloch Hamiltonian H{6,4}

For the{8,4}lattice, there are 4 sites per hyperbolic unit cell, which we label by 1 ≤j≤4 according to the translation γj

We follow Ref. 65 for the numerical computation of the first
Chern number. Here we recount the key steps of this method.A Python implementation is available in the Supplementary

Integration over a compact surface, in this case the BZ torus,
must give an integer.
In a numerical computation, the Brillouin zone T2is di-

Ui(k)≡⟨b(k)|b(k+ℓˆi)⟩. (B9)
(Note that in the limit ℓ→0, the U(1) links are unitary. Nu-
merical computation uses finite ℓ, so the U(1) links should
be “unitarized” by dividing them by their complex modulus.)
Equation (B8) is gauge invariant and summing it over all dis-
cretized kalways gives an integer [65]. It is also computation-
ally e fficient as the squares do not need to be infinitesimal as
long as the numerical algorithm ensures that the Berry phase
on each square (extracted only modulo 2 πwith the logarithm
in Eq. (B8)), consistently lies in the branch ( −π,π] throughout
the torus.
For our analysis, we need to compute the total Chern num-
ber for a multiplet of nfilled bands

Appendix C: Hyperbolic band theory
In this paper, we investigate the momentum-space topol-
ogy of selected hyperbolic Haldane models on {p,q}lat-
tices. For a complete analysis of tight-binding models in
HBT, one must first determine for each lattice (1) the cor-
rect translation group, (2) the structure of momentum space,
and (3) the correct point-group symmetries. The transla-
tion group and momentum space for five out of the seven
lattices considered (Fig. 5) has been clarified in previous
works [9, 11, 12, 32]. In this Appendix we elucidate the trans-
lation group and momentum-space structure for the remaining
two lattices,{6,4}and{12,3}, which have featured in recent
works [3, 39, 40]. Additionally, we present a comprehensive
analysis of point-group symmetries in both real space and mo-
mentum space for all seven lattices, which so far had only
been carried out for the {8,8}and{8,3}lattices in Refs. 6 and
9. Finally, we also outline how HBT can be constructed for an
arbitrary{p,q}lattice, a task whose completion we leave for a
future work [15].
This Appendix is subdivided into four subsections. First, in
Appendix C 1 we review general notions of hyperbolic crys-
tallography, providing some additional details that were omit-
ted in Sec. III A of the main text. Next, in Appendix C 2 we
study the{6,4}lattice in detail, showing that its BZ is 4D.
In Appendix C 3, we repeat the same exercise for the {12,3}
lattice to reveal the construction of its 6D BZ. Finally, in Ap-
pendix C 4 we discuss hyperbolic point groups for all the {p,q}
lattices listed in Fig. 5, with the key information summarized
in Table IV.
1. Hyperbolic crystallography
We begin by supplementing Sec. III A with additional re-
marks. In the discussion we extensively utilize the notation
(a,b,c,P,Q,R,T) for the group elements as summarized in
Fig. 4. The triangle group ∆(2,q,p), to be interpreted as the
space group of the {p,q}lattice, is specified in terms of the
reflections a,b,cin Fig. 4 by the presentation
∆(2,q,p)=D
a,b,ca2,b2,c2,(ab)2,(bc)q,(ca)pE
,(C1)
where all the compositions (called relators ) listed to the
right of the vertical line are set to equal the identity ele-
ment. Our symmetry analysis necessitates borrowing results
from Riemann surface theory [61], in which one is primarilyinterested in orientation-preserving isometries of hyperbolic
space. In this context, one considers the index-2 subgroup
of orientation-preserving symmetries in ∆(2,q,p), known as
thevon Dyck group (orproper triangle group ), defined by the
presentation
D(2,q,p)=D
P,Q,RR2,Qq,Pp,RQPE
, (C2)
where
R=ab, Q=bc, P=ca (C3)
are rotations by π, 2π/q, and 2π/paround the three respective
corners of the Schwarz triangle (see footnote 1). The relator
RQP =(ab)(bc)(ca)=1 follows trivially from the relators
listed in Eq. (C1). As a fundamental domain of the von Dyck
group, we can take any triangle consisting of two adjacent
Schwarz triangles; this larger domain is conventionally called
thefundamental triangle .
In the main text we have defined the translation group8
T(2,q,p) as the smallest-index, i.e., “largest” subgroup
of∆(2,q,p) that is torsion-free, normal, and orientation-
preserving. This last condition implies that we can instead
look for the smallest-index torsion-free normal subgroup of
D(2,q,p), as it contains as subgroups all the orientation-
preserving subgroups of ∆(2,q,p). The proper point group
Ps(2,q,p)=D(2,q,p)/T(2,q,p)=P(2,q,p)/Z2 (C4)
captures the residual orientation-preserving symmetries that
act on the unit cell,
unit cell =D/T(2,q,p). (C5)
The unit cell as defined by Eq. (C5) has the geometry and
topology of a Riemann surface of genus g≥2.
Quotients of hyperbolic von Dyck groups which act on
a Riemann surface with genus 2 ≤g≤101 have been
tabulated by Conder [61]. In particular, Conder’s table
provides the presentation of every such quotient group in
terms of cosets9˘P,˘Q,˘Rof rotations P,Q,Rin the von Dyck
group.10Knowing the presentation of the quotient (proper
point group) Ps(2,q,p), in combination with the presentation
of the von Dyck group D(2,q,p) in Eq. (C2), we are able
to invert the relation (C4) to uniquely identify the transla-
tion group T(2,q,p). Subsequently, by considering the action
8More broadly, by a hyperbolic translation group we mean any strictly hy-
perbolic subgroup of PSU (1,1), the full group of orientation-preserving
isometries of the hyperbolic plane. Being strictly hyperbolic is a stronger
notion than being torsion-free. The group T(2,q,p) as defined in the text
can be shown to also be strictly hyperbolic.
9Given a normal subgroup T◁Dand an element g∈D, the left (right) coset
˘g⊂Dis a collection of elements in Dconstructed as ˘ g=gT:={gγ|γ∈T}
(resp. as ˘ g=Tg:={γg|γ∈T}). Since Tis anormal subgroup, left and
right cosets coincide, i.e., ˘ g=gT=Tg. The coset of the identity is ˘1=T.
10Contrary to our introduction of the breve (˘) symbol, Ref. 61 does not sym-
bolically distinguish elements of the von Dyck group from elements of the
hyperbolic point group. In addition, the following relabelling is necessary
to translate between our notation and theirs: {R,Q,P}↔{ x,y,z}.22

ofT(2,q,p) on the Schwarz triangles, we utilize Eq. (C5) to
identify the unit cell of the hyperbolic translation group as
well as its appropriate identification of edges. This analysis
is carried out in detail for the {6,4}lattice in Appendix C 2
and for the{12,3}lattice in Appendix C 3. For convenience,
we list in Table III all the {p,q}lattices which per the above
construction result in a unit cell of genus 2 ≤g≤10, corre-
sponding to a 2 g-dimensional BZ.
To obtain the symmetry group of the hyperbolic Haldane
model in the absence of a sublattice mass ±m, all orientation-
reversing elements of ∆(2,q,p) must be composed with time
reversalT. The resulting type-III [67, 68] magnetic hyper-
bolic space group is thus obtained simply by replacing in
Eq. (C1) the generators a,b,cbyTa,Tb,Tc, namely
M(2,q,p)=
Ta,Tb,Tc (C6)(Ta)2,(Tb)2,(Tc)2,(ab)2,(bc)q,(ca)p,
or, equivalently,
M(2,q,p)=D(2,q,p)∪T∆(2,q,p)\D(2,q,p),(C7)
where we have treated the groups as sets. Note that time re-
versal commutes with space-group symmetries, therefore we
have simplifiedTaTb=abin Eq. (C7).11The fundamen-
tal domain of M(2,q,p) is again the Schwarz triangle. The
11To be more precise, time reversal commutes with reflections in spinlesssubgroup of orientation-preserving elements of M(2,q,p) is
again the von Dyck group (C2), implying that M(2,q,p) and
∆(2,q,p) are characterized by the same translation group.
In the presence of a sublattice mass ( m,0), which is al-
lowed in Haldane models with even p, the symmetry group is
generated by elements TbandTctogether with ( ca)2=:P2,
where the last operation is a counter-clockwise rotation by
4π/paround the face of the underlying {p,q}-lattice. We la-
bel the resulting type-III magnetic hyperbolic space group as
eM(2,q,p) to distinguish it from Eq. (C7). It is uniquely spec-
ified by its presentation
eM(2,q,p)=
P2,Tb,Tc (C8)(Tb)2,(Tc)2,(bc)q,(P2)p/2,P2(Tc)P2(Tc).
This is an index-2 subgroup of M(2,q,p), and its fundamental
domain consists of a pair of Schwarz triangles meeting along
their common edge associated with the broken reflection a.
The identification of the translation group in the presence of
a non-vanishing sublattice mass min the Haldane Hamilto-
nian (2) requires some care. We are unaware of a general
proof showing that T(2,q,p) as constructed above should al-
ways be a subgroup of eM(2,q,p); however, this is indeed the
case for the seven {p,q}lattices displayed in Fig. 5.
In summary, given any of the seven {p,q}lattices in Fig. 5,
one can study hyperbolic Haldane models on them (with or
without sublattice mass) by adopting the hyperbolic trans-
lation group T(2,q,p) derived from the von Dyck group
D(2,q,p) using the steps outlined above.
2. Symmetry and momentum space of {6,4}lattice
We proceed by applying the general prescription from Ap-
pendix C 1 to identify the translation group and construct mo-
mentum space for the {6,4}lattice. In Ref. 61, the quotient
of the von Dyck group D(2,4,6) that acts on a Riemann sur-
face with the smallest possible genus g=2 is listed as “T2 .2”
[which we relabel here as Ps(2,4,6)]. This is stated to be a
finite group of order 24, specified by the presentation
Ps(2,4,6)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q4,˘P6,˘R˘Q˘P,(˘Q˘P−1)2E
.(C9)
By comparing the presentation in Eq. (C9) to that in Eq. (C2),
we observe one additional relator ( ˘Q˘P−1)2=˘1 in the point
group. Therefore, ( QP−1)2∈D(2,4,6) must be an el-
ement of the translation subgroup T(2,4,6). We denote
it as ( QP−1)2=:γ1.
We approach the identification of T(2,4,6) geometri-
cally, while leaving a systematic algorithmization for fu-
ture work [15]. In particular, our strategy for finding the
hyperbolic unit cell is to follow the trajectory of selected
systems (i.e.,T2=1 andTa=aT) and anticommutes with reflections in
spinful systems (i.e., T2=−1 andTa=−aT). One finds thatTaTb=ab
in both cases.23
FIG. 11. Identification of the hyperbolic translation group of the {6,4}lattice (see Appendices C 2 and C 4 b).
Schwarz triangles in the hyperbolic plane under the action
of (QP−1)2=QP−1QP−1. To that end, we define the gen-
erators P,Q,Rin Eq. (C2) with respect to the corners of
the positively-oriented Schwarz triangle outlined with orange
edges in Fig. 11(a) (see Fig. 4 in the main text). To study
the action of ( QP−1)2=QP−1QP−1on the triangular tessel-
lation, it is convenient to take as the initial Schwarz triangle
for the trajectory the one displayed in blue in Fig. 11(a), and
we act on it successively with rotations P−1,Q,P−1, and Q
(dashed green arrows); then the initial (blue) Schwarz trian-
gle will follow a trajectory [summarized in Fig. 11(b)] that
passes through triangles displayed in purple /red/orange un-
til reaching the Schwarz triangle displayed in dark yellow.
The net motion along QP−1QP−1=:γ1[turquoise arrow in
Fig. 11(a)] corresponds to a nontrivial element of the transla-
tion group T(2,4,6), meaning that either the initial (blue) or
the final (dark yellow) triangle lies in the fundamental domain,
but not both .
Next, we construct six elements of T(2,4,6) as
γj:=P(j−1)γ1P−(j−1), j=1,..., 6. (C10)
Indeed, since ˘ γ1=˘1 inside the quotient Ps(2,4,6), one also
has ˘γj=˘P(j−1)˘γ1˘P−(j−1)=˘P(j−1)˘P−(j−1)=˘1, meaning that
{γj}6
j=1are indeed elements of T(2,4,6). Since the defining re-
lation in Eq. (C10) corresponds to conjugation with rotations
around the center of the disk [see Fig. 11(a)], we easily iden-
tify the action of all {γj}6
j=1on the hyperbolic plane. In particu-
lar, for each translation γjwe show a pair of triangular regions
which are related through that translation [pairs of matching
colors in Fig. 11(c)]. Since only one member of each colored
triangle-pair in Fig. 11(c) can lie within the fundamental do-
main of T(2,4,6), a simple choice for the hyperbolic unit cell
becomes apparent: the dashed red, semi-regular dodecagon
outlined in Fig. 11(c). This unit cell and its pairwise identi-
fication of edges were also derived using algebraic geometrymethods in Ref. 74. The resulting compactified surface is a
genus-2 Accola-Maclachlan surface [75, 76], corresponding
to the complex algebraic curve w2=z6−1. The dodecagonal
unit cell contains 24 fundamental triangles (i.e., 48 Schwarz
triangles), thus matching the order of Ps(2,4,6) as specified in
Ref. 61.
We next need to derive a presentation of the translation
group T(2,4,6) in terms of generators and relators. Since the
six translations in Eq. (C10) relate all twelve edges of the do-
decagonal unit cell in Fig. 11(c), they comprise a su fficient set
of generators. To identify the relators, we follow the trajec-
tory of corners of the unit cell under suitable combinations of
{γj}6
j=1. We find that the dodecagonal unit cell is demarcated
by three distinct corners (by “distinct” we mean modulo trans-
lations; i.e., δv=2 in terms of footnote 2), which we label A,
B, and C. We observe that corner A [green dots in Fig. 11(c)]
is brought to its initial position under sequential translations
byγ5,γ3, andγ1, i.e., A =γ1γ3γ5A. Thus we deduce the
first relator, namely γ1γ3γ5=1. By similarly following the
trajectory of the remaining corners B and C [purple resp. or-
ange dots in Fig. 11(c)], we complete the set of relators with
γ2γ4γ6=1 andγ1γ2γ3γ4γ5γ6=1. Therefore, we obtain
T(2,4,6)=D
γ1,...,γ 6γ1γ3γ5,γ2γ4γ6,γ1γ2γ3γ4γ5γ6E

as the presentation of the hyperbolic translation group of the
{6,4}lattice. This matches the information listed in Table I of
the main text.
Finally, to construct HBT, we study constraints on the map
ρk:γj7→eikjto be a 1D IR. The first two relators in Eq. (C11)
respectively imply that
k5=−k1−k3and k6=−k2−k4, (C12)
which turn out to be automatically consistent with the third
relator. We thus conclude that the BZ of 1D IRs for the {6,4}24

sponding to a dodecagonal unit cell and six twisted boundary
conditionsρk:γj7→eikjshown in Fig. 11(c) and with phases
k5andk6fixed by Eq. (C12).
3. Symmetry and momentum space of {12,3}lattice
We now repeat the exercise of the previous section for the
{12,3}lattice. In Ref. 61, the quotient of the von Dyck group
D(2,3,12) that acts on a Riemann surface with the smallest
possible genus g=3 is listed as “T3 .3” [which we relabel
here as Ps(2,3,12)]. This is stated to be a finite group of order
48 with the presentation
Ps(2,3,12)=
˘P,˘Q,˘R (C13)˘R2,˘Q3,˘R˘Q˘P,˘R˘P2˘Q−1˘P−3.
By comparing Eqs. (C13) and (C2), we recognize one addi-
tional relator ˘R˘P2˘Q−1˘P−3=˘1 in the point group. Therefore,
RP2Q−1P−3∈D(2,3,12) must be an element of the transla-
tion group T(2,3,12). We denote it as RP2Q−1P−3=:γ−1
4.
Similar to the discussion in Appendix C 2, we define the
generators P,Q,Rin Eq. (C2) with respect to the corners
of the positively-oriented Schwarz triangle positioned above
the positive horizontal axis [outlined with orange edges in
Fig. 12(a)]. For concreteness, we depart from the Schwarz
triangle displayed in blue, and we act on it successively with
rotations P−3,Q−1,P2, and R(dashed green arrows); then the
initial (blue) Schwarz triangle will follow a trajectory [sum-
marized in Fig. 12(b)] that passes through triangles displayed
in purple /red/orange until reaching the Schwarz triangle dis-
played in dark yellow. The net motion along RP2Q−1P−3=:
γ−1
4[turquoise arrow in Fig. 11(a)] corresponds to a nontrivialelement of the translation group T(2,3,12), meaning that ei-
ther the initial (blue) or the final (dark yellow) triangle lies in
the fundamental domain, but not both.
We now construct twelve elements of T(2,3,12) via
γ−1
j:=P(j−4)γ−1
4P−(j−4), j=1,..., 12. (C14)
Indeed, knowing that ˘ γ−1
4=˘1 inside the quotient Ps(2,3,12),
one has ˘γ−1
j=˘P(j−4)˘γ−1
4˘P−(j−4)=˘P(j−4)˘P−(j−4)=˘1, meaning
thatγjin Eq. (C14) are indeed elements of T(2,3,12). Since
the defining relation in Eq. (C14) corresponds to conjugation
with rotations around the center of the disk [cf. Fig. 12(a)],
we easily identify the action of all {γj}12
j=1on the hyperbolic
plane. In particular, for each translation γjwe show a pair of
pentagonal regions which are related through that translation
[pairs of matching colors in Fig. 12(c)]. Since only one mem-
ber of each colored pentagon-pair in Fig. 12(c) can lie within
the fundamental domain of T(2,3,12), a simple choice for the
hyperbolic unit cell becomes apparent: the dashed red 24-gon
outlined in Fig. 12(c). Upon identification of the edges, the
unit cell becomes a g=3 Riemann surface known as the
M(3) surface [77]. Counting reveals that there are 48 fun-
damental triangles (i.e., 96 Schwarz triangles) inside the con-
structed unit cell, which matches the order of Ps(2,3,12) listed
in Ref. 61.
We next derive a presentation of the translation group
T(2,3,12) in terms of{γj}12
j=1and relators. To identify the
relators, we follow the trajectory of corners of the unit cell
under suitable combinations of the translation generators. We
find that the unit cell is demarcated by seven distinct corners
(i.e.,δv=6 in terms of footnote 2), which we label by letters
from A to G. We observe that corner A [red dots in Fig. 12(c)]
is brought to its initial position under sequential translations
byγ1,γ5, andγ9, i.e., A =γ9γ5γ1A. Thus we deduce the
first relator, namely γ9γ5γ1=1. By similarly following the25

pendix C 4. The last column gives the order (number of elements) of
P(2,q,p), which equals twice the order of Ps(2,q,p).

relators we derive constraints on the momenta parameterizing

k12=k1−k3+k5−k6.
4. Hyperbolic point groups
In this section, we systematically go through the hyperbolic
{p,q}lattices listed in Fig. 5, and for each discuss the (full)
point group P(2,q,p) and the proper point group Ps(2,q,p).
In particular, we discuss how the point-group relators listedby Conder [61] can be reduced to certain standardized forms
which are usually found in the mathematical literature, and
that allow for easier derivations of the corresponding trans-
lation groups and hyperbolic unit cells. The considerations
that reveal the hyperbolic unit cells and the identification of
their edges under hyperbolic translations are illustrated for
the seven distinct lattices in Figs. 11–17. The collected in-
formation on the hyperbolic point groups is summarized by
Table IV.
a. Point group of {8,3}lattice
The proper point group of the {8,3}lattice is specified in
Ref. 61 by the presentation
Ps(2,3,8)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q3,˘R˘Q˘P,˘P˘Q˘R˘P˘Q−1˘P−1˘R˘PE
.(C17)
In contrast, Ref. 74 defines the same group by
Ps(2,3,8)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q3,˘P8,˘R˘Q˘P,˘R˘P4˘R˘P−4E
.(C18)
We show how the more standard relators in Eq. (C18) can be
obtained from those listed in Eq. (C17), thus making the two
definitions equivalent.
To begin, we obtain from ˘R˘Q˘P=˘1 with ˘R2=˘1 that
˘Q=˘R˘P−1and ˘Q−1=˘P˘R. (C19)
We use these expressions to replace ˘Qand its inverse in the
long relator in Eq. (C17), resulting in
˘1=˘P˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R˘P−1˘R˘P
=˘P2˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘P4˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘P2.(C20)
To simplify Eq. (C20), note that
˘1=˘Q3=˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1⇒ ˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1=˘R,(C21)
so that Eq. (C20) reduces to
˘1=˘P2˘R˘P4˘R˘P2
=˘R˘P4˘R˘P4, (C22)
where the second line is obtained from the first one through
conjugation with ˘P−2.
Furthermore, note that
˘P−1˘R˘P2=˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘P˘R˘P=˘P−1˘R2˘P=˘1, (C23)
and that the long relator in Eq. (C17) implies ˘P˘Q˘R˘P˘Q−1=
˘P−1˘R˘P. By combining the two previous results, we have
˘1=˘P˘Q˘R˘P˘Q−1˘P˘Q˘R˘P˘Q−1
=˘P˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R˘P˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R, (C24)
where in the second step we used Eq. (C19). From Eq. (C21)
we observe that ˘R˘P−1˘R=˘P˘R˘P, which we plug into Eq. (C24).
This results in
˘1=˘P˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R˘P˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R
=˘P˘P˘R˘P˘P2˘R˘P˘P˘R˘P˘P2˘R
=˘P2˘R˘P3˘R˘P2˘R˘P3˘R. (C25)26
FIG. 13. Identification of the hyperbolic translation group of the {8,3}lattice (see Appendix C 4 a).
Next, we extract from Eq. (C22) that
˘R˘P3=˘P−4˘R˘P−1and ˘P3˘R=˘P−1˘R˘P−4. (C26)
Substituting for these expression in Eq. (C25), we obtain
˘1=˘P2˘R˘P3˘R˘P2˘R˘P3˘R
=˘P2˘P−4˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−4
=˘P−2˘R˘P−1˘R˘P2˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−4. (C27)
Finally, we recognize in the previous line the known expres-
sion (C21) for ˘R, leading to
˘1=˘P−1˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘P4˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘R˘P−1˘P−3
=˘P−1˘R˘P4˘R˘P−3
=˘R˘P4˘R˘P−4, (C28)
where the last line is obtained from the previous one through
conjugation with ˘P. By comparing Eqs. (C22) and (C28), we
find that ˘P8=1. Note that the last two results are precisely
the relators listed in Eq. (C18).
The full point group is obtained through the usual re-
placement of rotation generators by reflections, as given by
Eq. (C3), resulting in
P(2,3,8)=D
˘a,˘b,˘c˘a2,˘b2,˘c2,(˘a˘b)2,
(˘b˘c)3,(˘c˘a)8,(˘a˘b)(˘c˘a)4(˘a˘b)(˘c˘a)−4E
.(C29)
Note that Eq. (C18) di ffers from the corresponding von Dyck
group in Eq. (C2) by the additional relator ˘R˘P4˘R˘P−4=˘1.
Therefore, RP4RP−4∈D(2,3,8) is an element of the trans-
lation subgroup T(2,3,8), which we label in Fig. 13 as γ1.
We recognize from the sketch in Fig. 13 that the hyperbolicunit cell corresponds to the Bolza cell [9, 31] and that trans-
lations relate antipodal edges of the Bolza cell. Compactifica-
tion of the unit cell edges results in the famous Bolza surface,
with algebraic curve description w2=z5−z[78]. We verify
in GAP that the group defined by Eq. (C29) is isomorphic to
GL(2,Z3)⋊Z2, which is the known automorphism group of
the Bolza surface [78, 79] of order 96. The proper point group
(C18) is found to be isomorphic to GL(2,Z3).
b. Point group of {6,4}lattice
We read from Ref. 61 that Ps(2,4,6) is given by Eq. (C9),
whereas Ref. 74 provides the seemingly di fferent presentation
P(2,4,6)=D
˘a,˘b,˘c˘a2,˘b2,˘c2,(˘a˘b)2,
(˘b˘c)4,(˘c˘a)6,(˘b˘c˘a˘c)2E
. (C30)
These two presentations of P(2,4,6) are easily shown to
be equivalent under the usual replacement of generators in
Eq. (C3). In particular, for the nontrivial relator one finds us-
ing˘Q=˘b˘cand ˘P−1=˘a−1˘c−1=˘a˘cthat
˘1=(˘Q˘P−1)2=(˘b˘c˘a˘c)2. (C31)
We thus identify ( QP−1)2=(bcac )2as an element of the trans-
lation subgroup T(2,4,6)◁∆(2,4,6), which is labelled as γ1
in Fig. 11.
Using GAP, we find that P(2,4,6) is a non-Abelian finite
group of order 48, isomorphic to D4×S3. Here, D4is the
dihedral group with 8 elements, which is the symmetry group
of a square (in the mathematical literature the same group is
sometimes denoted as D8), and S3is the permutation group
with 3! =6 elements. The proper point group is similarly
found to be isomorphic to ( Z3×Z2×Z2)⋊Z3.27
c. Point group of {8,4}lattice
From Ref. 61 we find that
Ps(2,4,8)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q4,
˘R˘Q˘P,(˘Q˘P−1)2,˘P−1˘R˘Q−1˘P−2E
.(C32)
We show how the above definition can be brought to a
more standard form. First, we find from the long relator in
Eq. (C32) that
˘1=˘P−1˘R˘Q−1˘P−2
=˘P−1˘Q˘P˘Q−1˘P−2
=˘P−1˘Q2˘P−3, (C33)
where in the second line we used that ˘R˘Q˘P=˘1 implies
˘R=˘Q˘P, and in the third line that ˘Q˘P−1˘Q˘P−1=˘1 implies
˘P˘Q−1=˘Q˘P−1. From the last line of Eq. (C33) we ob-
tain ˘Q2=˘P4. By squaring the last equality, we derive that
˘P8=˘Q4, which equals ˘1 according to the relators listed in
Eq. (C32). In addition, by conjugating Eq. (C33) with ˘P−3
and using ˘P−4=˘P4, we obtain the relator
˘P4˘Q2=˘1. (C34)
This allows us to bring the presentation of the proper point
group to the more standard form
Ps(2,4,8)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q4,˘P8,˘R˘Q˘P,˘P4˘Q2E
. (C35)
We recognize from the nontrivial relator that P4Q2must be
an element of the translation subgroup T(2,4,8)◁D(2,4,8),
which we label as γ−1
1in Fig. 14. We recognize from the
sketch in Fig. 14 that the hyperbolic unit cell is the Bolza cell
in which antipodal edges are identified by translations.
By performing the substitution from rotation generators to
reflections via Eq. (C3), we find that the point group is
P(2,4,8)=D
˘a,˘b,˘c˘a2,˘b2,˘c2,(˘a˘b)2,
(˘b˘c)4,(˘c˘a)8,(˘c˘a)4(˘b˘c)2E
.(C36)
In GAP, we find that the point group as defined above is a non-
Abelian finite group of order 32, isomorphic to Z8⋊(Z2×Z2).
Similarly, the proper point group in Eq. (C32) is found to be
isomorphic to Z8⋊Z2.
d. Point group of {10,5}lattice
The{10,5}lattice has recently been experimentally imple-
mented in the simulation of hyperbolic graphene in Ref. 5,
where identification of antipodal edges of the unit cell has
been adopted. We here confirm that this is indeed the choice
imposed by the underlying translation group. To that end, we
first read from Ref. 61 that
Ps(2,5,10)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q5,˘R˘Q˘P,˘R˘P˘QE
. (C37)Note that the pair of relators ˘R˘Q˘P=˘1=˘R˘P˘Qimply the
commutativity of generators QandP. Furthermore, by con-
jugating the first (second) of these relators with ˘R−1(with ˘Q),
we obtain ˘Q˘P˘R=˘1=˘Q˘R˘P, which immediately implies the
commutativity of generators PandR. In the same spirit one
obtains ˘P˘R˘Q=˘1=˘P˘Q˘R, meaning that generators ˘Rand
˘Qalso commute. Since all three generators pairwise com-
mute, we conclude that the proper point group Ps(2,5,10) is
Abelian.
To bring the presentation in Eq. (C37) into a more standard
form, we first consider the fifth power of ˘R˘Q˘P=˘1. Taking
into account the commutativity of generators, we obtain
˘1=(˘R˘Q˘P)5=˘R5˘Q5˘P5=˘R˘P5(C38)
where in the last step we used that ˘R2=˘1 and ˘Q5=˘1. Fur-
ther squaring Eq. (C38) results in ˘1=˘R2˘P10, from which we
deduce that ˘P10=˘1. Thus we obtain the more standard pre-
sentation of the proper point group as
Ps(2,5,10)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q5,˘P10,˘R˘Q˘P,˘R˘P5E
.(C39)
By comparing the previous equation to the presentation of the
von Dyck group D(2,5,10) in Eq. (C2), we recognize that RP5
is an element of the translation subgroup T(2,5,10), which we
labelγ1in Fig. 15. We also recognize from the same illustra-
tion that the unit cell is a regular decagon, and that transla-
tion symmetry relates its antipodal edges. The corresponding
g=2 Riemann surface is a Wiman surface of type I with al-
gebraic curve description w2=z5−1 [74].
The full point group is obtained by the replacement in
Eq. (C3). Note that in Eq. (C37) we can replace ˘R˘P˘Q=
(˘a˘b)(˘c˘a)(˘b˘c)=(˘a˘b˘c)2, suggesting the presentation
P(2,5,10)=D
˘a,˘b,˘c˘a2,˘b2,˘c2,
(˘a˘b)2,(˘b˘c)5,(˘c˘a)10,(˘a˘b˘c)2E
.(C40)
Using GAP, we find that P(2,5,10) is a non-Abelian group of
order 20 isomorphic to D10. On the other hand Ps(2,5,10) is
an Abelian group of order 10 isomorphic to Z10.
e. Point group of {7,3}lattice
The point group symmetry of the {7,3}unit cell is well
known in mathematics [80], since it corresponds to the largest
amount of conformal symmetry possible for a genus-3 sur-
face [81]. Namely, the proper [full] point group is isomorphic
toPSL(2,Z7) [PGL (2,Z7)]. Therefore, we only include a ba-
sic discussion of the relators and comment on the identifica-
tion of the unit cell edges.
We read from Ref. 61 that
Ps(2,3,7)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q3,˘R˘Q˘P,˘P−3˘R˘Q˘P−3,
˘Q˘R˘P˘Q˘R˘P˘Q−1˘P˘Q−1˘P−1˘R˘PE
.(C41)
We next perform the usual replacement (C3) of the rotation
generators by the reflection generators. Note that ˘1=˘R2=28
FIG. 14. Identification of the hyperbolic translation group of the {8,4}lattice (see Appendix C 4 b).
FIG. 15. Identification of the hyperbolic translation group of the {10,5}lattice (see Appendix C 4 d).
˘a˘b˘a˘bin combination with ˘ a2=˘1=˘b2implies that ˘ aand˘b
commute. Furthermore, ˘1=˘Q3=˘b˘c˘b˘c˘b˘cimplies that ˘ c˘b=
˘b˘c˘b˘c. With these rules in mind, we find
˘1=˘Q˘R˘P˘Q˘R˘P˘Q−1˘P˘Q−1˘P−1˘R˘P
=[˘b˘c][˘a˘b][˘c˘a][˘b˘c][˘a˘b][˘c˘a][˘c˘b][˘c˘a][˘c˘b][˘a˘c][˘a˘b][˘c˘a]

where the underlined terms in any expression indicate thosecombinations of generators ˘ a,˘b,˘cthat are substituted by the
bracketed terms or cancelled in the next line. Conjugating
Eq. (C42) with ˘ a, we obtain ˘1=(˘a˘b˘c)8. Indeed, the frequently
given presentation of P(2,3,7) is [79]
P(2,3,7)=D
˘a,˘b,˘c˘a2,˘b2,˘c2,
(˘a˘b)2,(˘b˘c)3,(˘c˘a)7,(˘a˘b˘c)8E
.(C43)
By comparing the previous equation to the presentation of the
triangle group ∆(2,3,7) in Eq. (C1), we recognize that end-
points of the “eight-step geodesic” ( abc)8constitute an ele-
ment of the translation subgroup T(2,3,7), which we label γ7
in Fig. 16. It is worth to emphasize that abc∈△(2,3,7) acts29

as a hyperbolic glide reflection, which reflects and translates
the Schwarz triangles as illustrated in Fig. 16. By following
the underlying glide plane, we observe that the correct iden-
tification of the unit cell edges is not antipodal [12, 32]. The
corresponding compactified g=3 Riemann surface is the fa-
mous Klein quartic [80, 82].
f. Point group of {12,3}lattice
We read from Ref. 61 that Ps(2,3,12) is given by Eq. (C13).
To bring this presentation to the standard form, we need to use
the relators in Eq. (C13) to derive ˘P12=˘1. To that end, we
first establish two results: first, that ˘Qand ˘P3commute, and
second, that ˘P˘Q˘P=˘Q−1. To show that ˘Qand ˘P3commute,
we first find from the last relator in (C13) that ˘P3=˘R˘P2˘Q−1.
Using ˘R˘Q˘P=˘1=˘R2, we can replace ˘Rby˘Q˘Pin the previous
equation, resulting in
˘P3=˘Q˘P3˘Q−1⇒ ˘Q˘P3=˘P3˘Q, (C44)
which is the sought-after commutativity. Next, we eliminate
˘Rin˘R˘Q˘P=˘R˘P2˘Q−1˘P−3, resulting in
˘1=˘Q˘P4˘Q˘P−2(C45)
=˘Q˘P˘P3˘Q˘P−2
=˘Q˘P˘Q˘P3˘P−2=˘Q˘P˘Q˘P, (C46)
where the last line is equivalent to the sought relation ˘P˘Q˘P=
˘Q−1. With these two results established, and utilizing ˘Q3=˘1,we derive that
˘P12=(˘Q−1˘P2˘Q−1)3
=˘Q−1˘P2˘Q−2˘P2˘Q−2˘P2˘Q−1
=˘Q2˘P2˘Q˘P2˘Q˘P2˘Q−1=˘Q2˘P(˘P˘Q˘P)2˘P˘Q−1
=˘Q2˘P˘Q−2˘P˘Q−1=˘Q2˘P˘Q˘P˘Q−1
=˘Q2˘Q−1˘Q−1=˘1 (C47)
where in the first line we used Eq. (C45). Thus, we find that
Eq. (C13) di ffers from D(2,3,12) only by the additional rela-
tor˘R˘P2˘Q−1˘P−3=˘1. We recognize that RP2Q−1P−3is an ele-
ment of the translation group T(2,3,12), as already analyzed
in Appendix C 3 and in Fig. 12.

.(C48)
In GAP, we find that P(2,3,12) thus defined is a non-Abelian
finite group of order 96. Interestingly, P(2,3,12) is isomor-
phic to GL(2,Z3)⋊Z2, which is also the automorphism group
of the Bolza surface. However, the compactified unit cell this
group acts on here is a genus-3 Riemann surface [77]. In con-
trast, the proper point group Ps(2,3,12) is isomorphic to12
SL(2,Z3)×Z4/⟨(−1,t2)⟩[62] which di ffers from the proper
automorphism group of the Bolza surface.

(˘Q˘P−1)2,˘P−2˘R˘Q−1˘P−3E
.(C49)
To bring this presentation into the standard form, we need to
show that ˘P12=˘1. To achieve this, first note that ˘R˘Q˘P=˘1
implies ˘R=˘P−1˘Q−1. Substituting this into the last relator in
Eq. (C49) leads to
˘1=˘P−3˘Q−2˘P−3, (C50)
which is equivalent to
˘P6=˘Q2. (C51)
Squaring the last equation results in to ˘P12=˘Q4=˘1 where
the last step corresponds to one of the relators in Eq. (C49).
Note that we can take a modified version of Eq. (C51),
namely ˘Q2˘P6=˘1, as the nontrivial relator that reduces the von
Dyck group D(2,4,12) to the proper point group Ps(2,4,12),
i.e.
Ps(2,4,12)=D˘P,˘Q,˘R˘R2,˘Q4,˘P12,˘R˘Q˘P,˘Q2˘P6E
.(C52)
We therefore recognize that Q2P6∈D(2,4,12) is an element
of the translation subgroup T(2,4,12), which we label γ1in
Fig. 17. Using GAP we find that the proper point group as
defined in Eq. (C52) is isomorphic to Z4×S3, where S3is
the permutation group of three elements. The full point group

Appendix D: Action of symmetries on hyperbolic momentum
In this Appendix, we study the action of symmetry elements
gin∆(or in any of the magnetic hyperbolic space groups de-
rived from it) on the hyperbolic momentum k. Our discus-
sion formalizes and generalizes the discussion of {8,3}lat-
tices in the Supplementary Materials of Ref. 9. Specifically,
we show that the action of gamounts to linear transformations
g:k7→Mgk, and call Mg∈GL(2g,Z) the point-group ma-
trix of g. Our discussion is divided into two parts. First, in
Appendix D 1 we present the general considerations that re-
veal the general form of the transformation, and indicate how
Mgis computationally extracted. Then, in Appendix D 2 we
list the extracted matrices Mgfor the symmetry generators
a,b,c,P,Q,Rof all seven hyperbolic {p,q}lattices listed in
Fig. 5.1. General considerations
For simplicity we drop here the dependence of the groups
∆,TandPon the choice of{p,q}lattice. To begin, we define
Sgψ(z)=ψ(g−1(z)) (D1)
for any symmetry g∈∆. The definition (D1) ensures that
Scorrectly behaves as a representation rather than an anti-
representation, i.e., SgSg′=Sgg′. By definition of hyperbolic
momenta, an Abelian Bloch state transforms as Sγψ(z)=
χ(γ)ψ(z) for translations γ∈T◁∆, whereχ:T→U(1) de-
pends on the choice of momentum in the hypercubic Brillouin
zone.
We next consider a general symmetry g∈∆, so that we have
[Sg,H]=0. Thus ifψ(z) is an eigenstate of Hwith energy
Eand certain momentum k, thenψg(z) :=Sgψ(z) is also an
eigenstate ofHwith the same energy. Furthermore, ψg(z)
also obeys the Abelian Bloch theorem, but with a di fferent
crystal momentum kglinearly related to the momentum kof
the original state. To see this, consider any generator γiofT,
and observe that
Sγiψg(z)=SgS−1
gSγiSgψ(z)
=SgSg−1γigψ(z)
=Sgχ(g−1γig)ψ(z)
=χ(g−1γig)ψg(z),(D2)
where in the third line we used that g−1γig∈Tdue to T
being a normal subgroup of ∆, and in the last line we used
thatχ(g−1γig) is not operator-valued and can thus be com-
muted withSg. Furthermore, since g−1γig∈T, this element
can be expressed as a word in the generators γj. Denote by
(Mg)i
j∈Zthe number of times γjappears in this word, with
negative entries corresponding to powers of the inverse; we
then have
χ(g−1γig)=ei(Mg)i
jkj(D3)
usingχ(γj)=eikj. From Eq. (D2), if ψ(z) is an Abelian Bloch
state with momentum k, thenψg(z) is an Abelian Bloch state
with momentum ˜kgiven by
˜k=Mgk, (D4)
where Mgis a 2 g-dimensional representation of ∆over the
field of integers, i.e., M:∆→GL(2g,Z). Note that det Mg=
±1, which follows from the fact that both matrices Mgand
Mg−1have integer entries and therefore an integer determinant,
combined with the fact that (det Mg)(det Mg−1)=1.
Let us emphasize that Mg1=Mg2when g1andg2belong
to the same coset of Tin∆. Indeed, assuming that g2=γg1
with someγ∈T, we find that the number ( Mg1)i
jof times that
γjappears in g−1
1γig1is clearly equal to the number ( Mg2)i
jof
times thatγjappears in g−1
2γig2=g−1
1γ−1γiγg2, as the con-
tributions from γandγ−1cancel. Therefore, we actually deal
with a map M:P→GL(2g,Z). For this reason, we call Mg
thepoint-group matrix of g . We automatize the extraction of31
FIG. 17. Identification of the hyperbolic translation group of the {12,4}lattice (see Appendix C 4 g).
matrices Mgas defined above by writing a computer program
in the computational group theory language GAP [51, 64].
Finally, for anti-unitary elements, which take the form gT
whereTis time reversal, we modify Eq. (D1) to
SgTψ(z)=ψ∗(g−1(z))=:ψgT(z) (D5)
where the star indicates complex conjugation. Then Eq. (D2)
is modified to
SγiψgT(z)=SgTS(gT−1)SγiSgTψ(z)
=SgTS(gT)−1γi(gT)ψ(z)=SgTSg−1γigψ(z)
=SgTχ(g−1γig)ψ(z)=χ∗(g−1γig)ψgT(z),(D6)
where in the third equality we used that time reversal com-
mutes with all spatial transformations g, and complex conju-gation in the last expression arises from commuting χ(g−1Tg)
with the antiunitary operator SgT. Complex conjugation flips
the sign of eiMgk, thus we find
MgT=−Mg, (D7)
i.e., time reversal reverses all components of the hyperbolic
momentum.
2. Hyperbolic point-group matrices
Here we list the point-group matrices for the symmetry gen-
erators a,b,c,P,Q,R, computed for all seven {p,q}lattices
considered. We verify that for each lattice, the point-group
matrices correctly obey the group relations in Appendix C 4.

Appendix E: Symmetry relations between Chern numbers
It is known that crystal symmetries constrain topological
invariants. While previous work has elucidated point-group
symmetry constraints on Chern numbers in Euclidean lat-
tices [83], we here investigate symmetry relations between
Chern numbers in the higher-dimensional BZ of hyperbolic
lattices. Since the objects involved acquire multiple compo-
nents (having two band indices and multiple coordinate in-
dices), a suitable mathematical language is necessary to keep
the derivations compact. The appropriate mathematical for-
malism here is that of matrix-valued di fferential forms.
The following discussion is divided into four parts. First, in
Appendix E 1 we provide a short overview of matrix-valued
differential forms and their elementary manipulations [63, 84].
Then, in Appendix E 2 we introduce the Berry-Wilczek-Zee
(BWZ) connection and curvature in the language of matrix-
valued di fferential forms. We also verify there the well-known
gauge covariance of the BWZ curvature and the gauge invari-
ance of Chern characters and Chern numbers, with the goal
of demonstrating the e fficiency of the adopted mathematical
language. Finally, in Appendices E 3 and E 4 we deploy this
mathematical formalism to identify symmetry constraints on
first resp. second Chern numbers. In particular, we derive
there Eqs. (8), (10), and (11), which in combination with the
point-group matrices listed in Appendix D result in the Chern
numbers and Chern matrices presented in Sec. III C of the
main text.
1. Matrix-valued di fferential forms
Our discussion adapts the language of matrix-valued dif-
ferential forms [63, 84], i.e., 2D arrays (matrices) Xwhose
components Xab=P
i...ℓXab
i···ℓdki∧···∧ dkℓare di fferential
forms. Here, the coordinates ( ki) are momenta in the BZ torus,
and the matrix rows and columns (indices a,b,...) run over
directions in the Hilbert space of Bloch Hamiltonians. The
coefficients appearing in the expansion of di fferential forms(and of matrix-valued di fferential forms) into coordinate dif-
ferentials are skew-symmetric under exchange of any two co-
ordinate indices (labelled by Latin subscripts i,j,k,ℓ), e.g.,
Xab
i jkℓ···=−Xab
jikℓ···.13
There are two key operations on matrix-valued di fferential
forms that we utilize and which we briefly review below: the
wedge product (∧) and the exterior derivative ( d).
Thewedge product (also called exterior product ) combines
a differential form αof degree pand a di fferential form βof
degree qinto a di fferential form α∧βof degree p+q. (The de-
gree counts the number of coordinate di fferentials appearing
in the corresponding di fferential form.) The wedge product
obeys
α∧β=(−1)pqβ∧α (E1)
which is known as graded commutativity .
Matrix-valued di fferential forms XandYwhose matrix di-
mensions are compatible with the standard matrix multiplica-
tion can also be multiplied with the wedge. In matrix compo-
nents,
(X∧Y)ab=X
cXac∧Ycb. (E2)
We still call this the wedge (or exterior) product, even though
it clearly combines both the exterior product of di fferential
forms and the scalar product of rows and columns of the ma-
trices. If any of the matrix-valued di fferential forms in a prod-
uct is of degree zero, i.e., it is an ordinary matrix, then the
corresponding product reduces to the usual matrix multipli-
cation. Therefore, we sometimes drop the wedge ( ∧) symbol
appearing before or after such a matrix.
13Our convention is that band indices a,b,...always appear as superscripts,
while coordinate indices i,j,k,ℓ,... appear as subscripts (superscripts) if
they are covariant (contravariant). Indices of di fferential forms are all co-
variant, while some contravariant coordinate indices arise from coordinate
transformations—see, e.g., Eq. (E34).34
The wedge product of matrix-valued di fferential forms
does not obey graded commutativity, owing to the non-
commutativity of matrix multiplication. However, the graded
commutativity is restored for the trace over the matrix com-
ponents. Namely, the graded cyclic property states that
tr[X∧Y]=X
a(X∧Y)aa=X
acXac∧Yca
=X
ac(−1)pqYca∧Xac=(−1)pqX
c(Y∧X)cc
=(−1)pqtr[Y∧X] (E3)
where XandYare matrix-valued di fferential forms of degree
presp. q. A similar graded property appears when taking
the transpose of a wedge product of matrix-valued di fferen-
tial forms, namely
n
(X∧Y)⊤oab=(X∧Y)ba=X
cXbc∧Yca
=X
c(−1)pqYca∧Xbc
=(−1)pqX
c(Y⊤)ac∧(X⊤)cb
=(−1)pq{Y⊤∧X⊤}ab. (E4)
It follows that
(X∧Y)⊤=(−1)pqY⊤∧X⊤, (E5)
and similarly for Hermitian conjugation.
For simplicity, we adopt in the following the Einstein sum-
mation convention from now on, meaning that we always as-
sume an implicit sum over repeated indices. We apply the
convention both to the band indices and to the coordinate in-
dices. We further introduce the short-hand notation
X∧j=X∧...∧X|        {z        }
jcopies of X(E6)
which we call the wedge power of a matrix-valued di fferential
form X. Note that the graded cyclic property implies that
trh
X∧(2j)i
=0 if Xhas odd degree , (E7)
because the even-powered X∧(2j)can be expressed as a wedge
product of two matrix-valued forms that are each of odd de-
gree, namely X∧(2j−1)∧X. Another consequence of Eq. (E3)
is that
trh
Y−1∧X∧Yi
≡trh
Y−1XYi
=tr[X]
ifYis of degree zero and invertible.(E8)
In the second expression above we have dropped the wedge
symbols per the convention stated below Eq. (E2).
The second operator we need is the exterior derivative
d, which increases the degree of (matrix-valued) di fferential
forms by 1 and such that
d2=0 (E9)(known as nilpotence of index 2) [63]. On the wedge product
of a di fferential p-formαwith a q-formβ, it obeys the graded
Leibniz rule ,
d(α∧β)=(dα)∧β+(−1)pα∧(dβ)
≡dα∧β+(−1)pα∧dβ (E10)
By combining Eqs. (E10) and (E2) we find that the exterior
derivative of the wedge product of matrix-valued di fferential
forms likewise obeys the graded Leibniz rule,
d(X∧Y)=dX∧Y+(−1)pX∧dY, (E11)
where pis the degree of X. Since dis a linear operator (i.e.,
“derivative of sum” is equal to “sum of derivatives”), it fol-
lows that it commutes with the trace,
dtr[X]=tr[dX], (E12)
which is also utilized in our discussion of symmetry con-
straints on Chern numbers.
The final ingredient we need is the integration of di fferential
forms on manifolds. A di fferential p-formαcan be integrated
over a p-dimensional manifold Mp. The Stokes theorem states
that [63, 84]
Z
Mp+1dα=I
∂Mp+1α (E13)
where∂is the boundary operator. In particular, it follows from
Eq. (E13) that the integral of an exact form α[i.e., that can be
expressed as α=dβfor some ( p−1)-formβ] on a closed man-
ifoldM(i.e., for which ∂M=∅) is necessarily zero. We also
encounter situations below where the di fferential form under
the integral sign is evaluated at a transformed position, i.e.,
expressions like
Z
Mpαi...ℓ(fk)dki∧...∧dkℓ. (E14)
The form under the integral sign is called the push-back ofα
byf, and we denote it as ˜ α.14A standard result in di fferential
geometry [63] states that
Z
Mp˜α=Z
f(Mp)α, (E15)
i.e., the transformation fcan be transferred from the
integrand14˜α=f∗αto the integration domain f(Mp).
14Conventionally, the push-back of αbyfis labelled as f∗α. However, our
work reserves the “∗” symbol for complex conjugation. Nevertheless, it
should always be clear what map fis used in the push-back considered,
therefore dropping ffrom the notation should not cause confusion. There-
fore, we opt for the non-standard ˜ αnotation.35
2. Berry-Wilczek-Zee connection and Chern numbers
We treat the occupied states of a (hyperbolic) Bloch Hamil-
tonian as a vector bundle V,→Eπ→Tdover the Brillouin
zone torus; more precisely, the noccupied Bloch states at mo-
mentum kspan the n-dimensional vector space Vthat projects
to momentum kin the d-dimensional torus ( Td). To relate the
vector spaces at adjacent momenta, we define a rule of paral-
lel transport by choosing a connection. The standard choice
for the characterization of energy bands in momentum space,
motivated by the theory of polarization [85–87], is as follows.
By arranging the occupied eigenstates at kas columns into a
rectangular matrix U, the Berry-Wilczek-Zee (BWZ) connec-
tion[72, 73] is defined as
A=U†dU, (E16)
and corresponds to a matrix-valued di fferential form of de-
gree one. Note that Uis arectangular matrix of dimension
N×n: itsncolumns correspond to the noccupied Bloch eigen-
states at k, and its Nrows correspond to components of these
eigenstates inside the N-dimensional Hilbert space of Bloch
states at k. For brevity, we do not explicitly display the k-
dependence of the mathematical objects on the two sides of
Eq. (E16). The associated BWZ curvature is a matrix-valued
differential form of degree two, constructed as
F=dA+A∧A. (E17)
One easily verifies using Eqs. (E9), (E11) and (E17) that
dF=dA∧A−A∧dA
=F∧A−A∧F, (E18)
which is known as the Bianchi identity [84].
Let us comment on the symmetry of the matrix-valued dif-
ferential forms FandAin band indices. Since U†U=1
for normalized eigenstates, it follows by taking the exterior
derivative that dU†U+U†dU=0. We recognize from here
that
A†=−A, (E19)
meaning that Ais skew-Hermitian in band indices. For Fwe
find that
F†=(dA)†+(A∧A)†(E5)=dA†−A†∧A†
(E19)=−dA−A∧A=−F, (E20)
therefore Fis also skew-Hermitian in band indices. It fol-
lows from the result (E20) that the wedge power F∧nis skew-
Hermitian and trF∧nis imaginary for n odd, whereas the
wedge power is Hermitian and the trace is real for n even.
Building on the notions introduced above, the n-th Chern
character (with integer n such that 2 ≤2n≤d) is a di fferential
form of degree 2n defined as
ch(n)=1
n!1
(2πi)ntrh
F∧ni
. (E21)Note that the appearance of inin the denominator implies that
Chern characters are real-valued di fferential forms. In addi-
tion, they are closed , meaning that
dch(n) =1
n!1
(2πi)ndtrh
F∧ni(E12)=1
n!1
(2πi)ntrh
d(F∧n)i
(E11,E3)=1
n!n
(2πi)ntrh
F∧(n−1)∧dFi
(E18)=1
n!n
(2πi)ntrh
F∧n∧A−F∧(n−1)∧A∧Fi
(E3)=1
n!n
(2πi)ntrh
F∧n∧A−F∧n∧Ai
=0 (E22)
where in applications of Eq. (E3) in the last line we cyclically
permuted the 2-form F, implying a positive sign in the graded
cyclic property.
The fact that Chern characters are closed forms suggests
their integrals are topological invariants. More precisely, the
prefactor in the definition (E21) is chosen such that the inte-
gral of the nthChern character over a closed (2n)-dimensional
submanifoldM2nofTdgives an integer-valued topological
invariant [88],
CM2n=I
M2nch(n)∈Z, (E23)
known as the nthChern number (of bundle Erestricted to sub-
manifoldM2n). Note that if 2n <d, there are multiple topo-
logically inequivalent choices of submanifold M ⊂ Td. In
particular, we find it convenient to arrange nthChern numbers
C(n),i...ℓ≡CT2n
i...ℓ=I
Td
i...ℓch(n) (E24)
computed over (2n)-dimensional subtori of Tdspanned by 2n
momenta ki,..., kℓinto an array C(n). This array is skew-
symmetric under exchange of any two momentum arguments,
because it is obtained by integrating a di fferential form which
is skew-symmetric under the same exchange (see the first
paragraph of Appendix E 1). In particular, first Chern num-
bers computed over 2D subtori of Tdcan be arranged into an
skew-symmetric matrix C(1). Similarly, second Chern num-
bers numbers computed over 4D subtori of Tdcan be arranged
into an skew-symmetric tensor of rank 4. In our applications
with d =4 and d =6, we find it convenient to utilize the
Hodge dual, C(2)=⋆C(2), with components
Ck···ℓ
(2)=1
4!C(2),i···jϵi···jk···ℓ(E25)
whereϵi···ℓ(with d indices in the superscript) is the completely
skew-symmetric Levi-Civita symbol. The dual C(2)is a single
number for d =4 and a skew-symmetric matrix for d =6.
Before analyzing symmetry constraints on the Chern num-
bers in Appendices E 3 and E 4, let us illustrate the conve-
nience of adopting the formalism of matrix-valued di fferen-
tial forms by considering the e ffect of gauge transformation.
Agauge transformation of the occupied states corresponds36
to a right multiplication of the matrix Uof occupied Bloch
states by a ( k-dependent) gauge matrix (sometimes also called
sewing matrix )B∈U(n),
U7→U′=UB, (E26)
where we use the prime (′) to denote the gauge-transformedquantities. The transformed BWZ connection is
A′=U′†dU′=B†U†[dUB +UdB ]
=B†AB+B†dB (E27)
where we utilized that U†U=1.
For the transformed BWZ curvature we find
F′=dA′+A′∧A′
=dh
B†AB+B†dBi
+h
B†AB+B†dBi
∧h
B†AB+B†dBi
=dB†∧AB+B†(dA)B−B†A∧dB+dB†∧dB
+(B†AB)∧(B†AB)+(B†AB)∧(B†dB)+(B†dB)∧(B†AB)+(B†dB)∧(B†dB)=:1O (E28)
where the minus sign in the third term follows from the graded Leibniz rule. From the unitarity of matrix Bwe have
B†B=1 (E29)
from which after applying dwe further obtain
B†dB=−dB†B. (E30)
We apply Eq. (E29) to the fifth and sixth terms in 1Oand Eq. (E30) to the last two terms therein. Then
1O=dB†∧AB+B†(dA)B−B†A∧dB+dB†∧dB
+B†(A∧A)B+B†A∧dB−dB†BB†∧AB−dB†BB†∧dB=:2O. (E31)
We observe that in 2Osix of the eight terms pairwise cancel, leaving behind
2O=B†(dA)B+B†(A∧A)B=B†FB, (E32)
i.e., the BWZ curvature transforms covariantly. One further easily verifies that the gauge matrices trivially cancel under the trace
[see also Eq. (E8)],
ch′
(n)=1
n!1
(2πi)ntrh
F′∧ni
=1
n!1
(2πi)ntrh
(B†FB)∧ni
=1
n!1
(2πi)ntrh
F∧ni
=ch(n), (E33)
meaning that Chern characters (as well as their integrals, i.e., Chern numbers) are invariant under gauge transformations.
3. Symmetry constraints on first Chern numbers
We finally deploy the mathematical techniques reviewed in
Appendix E 1 to study the di fferential and topological char-
acteristics described in Appendix E 3. As discussed in Ap-
pendix D, a general symmetry gof the hyperbolic lattice trans-
forms the momentum vector as
k7→˜k=Mgk,or˜ki=(Mg)i
jkjin components, (E34)
where we call Mg∈GL(2g,Z) the point-group matrix of sym-
metry g. We presently assume that gis unitary (i.e., it does
not involve time reversal), and we will comment on the an-
tiunitary case at the end of this section. Then there is a uni-
tary representation Vg(k)∈U(N) of symmetry gthat linearly
transforms the Hilbert space spanned by the hyperbolic Bloch
states at kto those at Mgk. In particular, Vg(k) also transforms
eigen states of the hyperbolic Bloch Hamiltonian at kto thoseatMgk. Since a general choice of gauge may not respect this
unitary relation, one is led to introduce the sewing matrix
B†(k)=U†(Mgk)Vg(k)U(k) (E35)
which is a U(n) matrix that encodes the gauge transformation
from Vg(k)U(k) toU(Mgk). By inverting Eq. (E35) we find
that eigenstates at Mgkare generally related to eigenstates at
kas [83]
U(Mgk)=Vg(k)U(k)B(k). (E36)
Our goal is to understand how Eq. (E36) relates the di fferential
objects defined in Appendix E 2 at kto those at Mgk, and
especially how it constrains the Chern numbers on subtori of
the higher-dimensional BZ.
The considerations of Eq. (E36) can be divided into two
steps. First, analyze the e ffect of the right multiplication with37
sewing matrix B(k), and second, of the left-multiplication
with the unitary representation Vg(k) of the symmetry gin
the Hilbert space. Note that the first step has been already an-
alyzed in great generality in Appendix E 2, where we revealed
the invariance of Chern characters and Chern numbers under
gauge transformations [see Eq. (E32)]. We can therefore con-
sider this step to be completed [e.g., by dropping B(k) from
Eq. (E36) altogether], and focus solely on the left multiplica-
tion with Vg(k).
The complexity of the second step (especially if contrasted
to a related discussion in Appendix B of Ref. 83) comes
mainly from the two following aspects of hyperbolic lattices.
First, the point-group matrices Mg∈GL(2g,Z) may not be
orthogonal. Second, we find that the unitary representations
Vgof some hyperbolic lattice symmetries (in particular for
g∈{b,Q,R}in most of the lattices discussed, see Fig. 6) are
non-symmorphic in the following sense: given an arbitrary
unit cell, we find it is not mapped by the symmetry onto a unit
cell related by an element of the translation group. Instead,
various parts of the unit cell are mapped to pieces of several
distinct unit cells which are obtained by various elements of
the translation group. As a consequence, the representation
Vgis necessarily k-dependent. For those reasons, computing
the BWZ connection and curvature generates additional terms
involving dVg(k), which turn out to be more subtle to manip-
ulate than the dB(k)-terms encountered during the discussion
of gauge transformations in Appendix E 2.
Having clarified the key idiosyncracies of hyperbolic mo-
mentum space, we proceed with the actual derivations. As
our analysis considers one symmetry gat a time, we drop the
subscript gin the equations. We recall that the BWZ connec-
tion is given by Eq. (E16). Then, computing the connection at
Mkand combining the expression with Eq. (E36) (where we
drop the sewing matrix for the reasons discussed above), we
find
A(Mk)=U†(Mk)dU(Mk)
=U†(k)V†(k)d[V(k)U(k)]. (E37)
Note that in Eq. (E37) we express the BWZ connection at Mk
solely in terms of variables at k(including the di fferentials d≡
d/dkof coordinates k). Using the language of Appendix E 1,
the left-hand side corresponds to a pull-back by M. Since
this is true for most subsequent equations, we will drop the
momentum arguments of all quantities. Quantities at Mk≡˜k,
usually appearing on the left-hand side of the equations, will
be henceforth decorated with a tilde (˜).
Manipulating Eq. (E37) further, we obtain
˜A=U†V†dVU +U†V†VdU
=Z+UdU|{z}
A(E38)
where we recognized the BWZ connection Aatk, and we
introduced the matrix-valued 1-form
Z=U†V†dVU. (E39)Plugging Eq. (E37) into Eq. (E17), we find that the BWZ cur-
vature at ˜kis expressed via quantities and di fferentials at kas
˜F=d(Z+A)+(Z+A)∧(Z+A)
=dA+A∧A|        {z        }
F+dZ+A∧Z+Z∧A+Z∧Z,(E40)
where we recognized the BWZ curvature Fatk. Focusing
presently on first Chern numbers, we next extract the trace,
trh˜Fi
=tr[F]+ tr[dZ]|{z}
dtr[Z]per Eq. (E12)+ trh
Z∧2i
| {z }
vanishes per Eq. (E7)
+tr[A∧Z]+tr[Z∧A].|                     {z                     }
cancel per Eq. (E3)(E41)
The term dtr[Z]in Eq. (E41) does not generally vanish; there-
fore, the Chern characters at kand˜kare related as
˜ch(1)=ch(1)+1
2πidtr[Z] (E42)
i.e., they di ffer by an amount set by dtr[Z(k)]/(2πi).
We next integrate both sides of Eq. (E42) over the 2D torus
T2
i jspanned by momenta ( ki,kj). On the right-hand side, we
recognize that the integration of the first term is precisely the
Chern number C(1),i jin Eq. (E24), whereas the integral of the
second term vanishes by Stokes’ theorem (E13). On the left-
hand side, we apply the rule (E15) for integrating push-backs
of differential forms, leading to
I
T2
i j˜ch(1)=I
M(T2
i j)ch(1). (E43)
The next key observation is geometrical , namely that M(T2
i j)
can be continuously deformed into a union of tori T2
kℓ, each
torus appearing with multiplicity Mk
iMℓ
j. To understand this,
note that by Eq. (E34) the transformed torus M(T2
i j) is spanned
by momenta ( Mki,Mkj), and observe that as kjwinds once
around the BZ torus, the ℓ-th component of Mkjwinds around
the BZ torus ∂˜kℓ/∂kj=Mℓ
jtimes (while the factor Mk
iis
obtained similarly by considering the progression of ˜kkupon
increasing ki). Since the integral which we compute is topo-
logical [see Eq. (E22)] and the Hamiltonian spectrum is pre-
sumed gapped throughout the entire BZ, its value is invariant
under such a continuous deformation of the integration do-
main; therefore,
(E43) =Mk
iMℓ
jI
T2
kℓch(1)=Mk
iC(1),kℓMℓ
j. (E44)
The last expression is naturally interpreted as a matrix mul-
tiplication. Combining this result with the integration of the
right-hand side of Eq. (E42), we conclude that the matrix of
first Chern numbers must obey the constraint
C(1)=M⊤
gC(1)Mg (E45)
if there is a unitary symmetry gthat transforms momenta with
Mg∈GL(2g,Z).38
Let us finally comment on the case of an antiunitary sym-
metry g, such as those which involve time reversal. In this
case there is an antiunitary representation Vg(k)Kthat linearly
transforms the Hilbert space spanned by hyperbolic Bloch
states at kto those at Mg(k), and Eq. (E36) is altered to
U(Mgk)=Vg(k)U∗(k)B(k). (E46)
One easily verifies that derivations in Eqs. (E37) to (E42) are
essentially unchanged, except that objects A,F,ch(1)evaluated
atkbecome complex-conjugated, and Eq. (E39) is replaced
byZ=U⊤V†dVU∗. Crucially, we showed in Eq. (E20) that
Fis skew-Hermitian with imaginary trace; therefore, ch∗
(1)=
−ch(1), leading to the appearance of a relative minus sign in
Eq. (E45). In total, we find that symmetry gconstrains thematrix of first Chern numbers as
C(1)=ςgM⊤
gC(1)Mg (E47)
whereςgis+1 (−1) for unitary (antiunitary) symmetry g. This
results corresponds to Eq. (8) in the main text.
4. Symmetry constraints on second Chern numbers
We proceed to investigate symmetry-imposed constraints
on second Chern numbers. These are obtained by integrat-
ing ch (2)=−1
8π2tr[F∧F]as prescribed in Eq. (E23). We
again first consider unitary symmetries, and comment on the
antiunitary case near the end of this section. Starting from
Eq. (E40), we find that
˜F∧˜F=F∧F +F∧dZ +F∧A∧Z +F∧Z∧A +F∧Z∧Z
+dZ∧F +dZ∧dZ +dZ∧A∧Z +dZ∧Z∧A +dZ∧Z∧Z
+A∧Z∧F+A∧Z∧dZ+A∧Z∧A∧Z+A∧Z∧Z∧A+A∧Z∧Z∧Z
+Z∧A∧F+Z∧A∧dZ+Z∧A∧A∧Z+Z∧A∧Z∧A+Z∧A∧Z∧Z
+Z∧Z∧F+Z∧Z∧dZ+Z∧Z∧A∧Z+Z∧Z∧Z∧A+Z∧Z∧Z∧Z,(E48)
in terms of A,FandZpreviously defined. Although at first sight intimidating, many terms in Eq. (E48) trivially vanish after
taking the trace. First of all, observe that all terms on the right-hand side can be expressed as wedge products of two matrix-
valued 2-forms. By commuting these matrix-valued 2-forms under the trace, we can reduce the list of terms to just the upper
triangular part of Eq. (E48), namely
trh˜F∧˜Fi
=tr[F∧F]+2 tr[F∧dZ]+2 tr[F∧A∧Z]+2 tr[F∧Z∧A] +2 tr[F∧Z∧Z]:::::::::::::
+tr[dZ∧dZ]...............+2 tr[dZ∧A∧Z]::::::::::::::+2 tr[dZ∧Z∧A]::::::::::::::+2 tr[dZ∧Z∧Z]....................
+tr[A∧Z∧A∧Z]+2 tr[A∧Z∧Z∧A]::::::::::::::::+2 tr[A∧Z∧Z∧Z]
+tr[Z∧A∧Z∧A]+2 tr[Z∧A∧Z∧Z]
+tr[Z∧Z∧Z∧Z],(E49)
where the meaning of the various types of underlining is clarified in the following.
Applying the graded cyclic property (E3) on some of the
terms, we identify the cancellations
2 tr[A∧Z∧Z∧Z]+2 tr[Z∧A∧Z∧Z]=0,(E50)
tr[A∧Z∧A∧Z]+tr[Z∧A∧Z∧A]=0,(E51)
while
tr[Z∧Z∧Z∧Z]=trh
Z∧4i
=0 (E52)
follows from Eq. (E7). The three equations above imply the
vanishing of the terms indicated with a dashed underline in
Eq. (E49).
We next find that certain terms in Eq. (E49) are total deriva-
tives (i.e., exact forms), implying that they yield zero upon
integration on closed manifolds. We can therefore drop themfrom the right-hand side of Eq. (E49). In particular,
tr[dZ∧dZ]=dtr[Z∧dZ], (E53)
2 tr[dZ∧Z∧Z]=2
3dtrh
Z∧3i
, (E54)
which correspond to terms indicated with dotted underline in
Eq. (E49). Further terms produce exact forms only if suitably
combined, especially
2 tr[F∧A∧Z]+2 tr[F∧Z∧A]+2 tr[F∧dZ]
(E3)=2 tr[F∧A∧Z−A∧F∧Z+F∧dZ]
(E18)=2 tr[dF∧Z+F∧dZ](E11)=2 tr[d(F∧Z)]
(E12)=2dtr[F∧Z]. (E55)
Therefore, these three terms together yield zero upon inte-
gration on a closed manifold, allowing us to drop them from39
Eq. (E49) where they are indicated with a solid underline. We
finally deal with the four terms indicated with squiggly under-
line in Eq. (E49). By performing cyclic permutations (E3), it
is possible to combine them to form
2 trh
(F−A∧A)∧Z∧Z−A∧[dZ∧Z−Z∧dZ]i
(E17,E11)= 2 tr[dA∧Z∧Z−A∧d(Z∧Z)]
(E11,E12)= 2dtr[A∧Z∧Z]. (E56)
The exactness implies that the four terms indicated with squig-
gly underline together yield zero upon integration over closed
manifolds, and can likewise be dropped from Eq. (E49). By
collecting the results above, we succeeded in showing that
˜ch(2)=ch(2)−1
8π2d(···), (E57)
where the dots comprise the right-hand sides of Eqs. (E53),
(E54), (E55), and (E56).
We next integrate both sides of Eq. (E57) over the 4D torus
T4
i1i2i3i4that is spanned by momenta ( ki1,ki2,ki3,ki4). Integra-
tion of the first-term on the right-hand side yields C(2),i1i2i3i4by
definition (E24), while integration of the second term yields
zero by Stokes’ theorem (E13). On the left-hand side we use
the push-back rule in Eq. (E15), which implies
I
T4
i1i2i3i4˜ch(2)=I
M(T4
i1i2i3i4)ch(2). (E58)
We next utilize the same geometric arguments as below
Eq. (E45), which allow us to express
(E58) =Mj1
i1Mj2
i2Mj3
i3Mj4
i4I
T4
j1j2j3j4ch(2). (E59)
Therefore, the integration of both sides of Eq. (E57) results in
C(2),i1i2i3i4=Mj1
i1Mj2
i2Mj3
i3Mj4
i4C(2),j1j2j3j4 (E60)
which we analyze below.
Let us briefly pause to consider the action of an antiunitary
symmetry g. The additional complex conjugation, displayed
explicitly in Eq. (E46), leads again to complex conjugation of
objects A,F,F∧F,ch(2)that appear on the right-hand sides of
expressions for ˜A,˜F,˜F∧˜F,˜ch(2), and also implies certain mi-
nor modification of Z. Crucially, since F∧Fis Hermitian [see
the text below Eq. (E20)], it follows that its trace is real, and
therefore ch∗
(2)=ch(2). Thus, we conclude that the relativesign in Eq. (E60) is positive both for unitary and for antiu-
nitary symmetries. The following analysis therefore applies
equally to both categories of symmetries.
To study the implications of Eq. (E60), it is convenient to
compute the Hodge dual C(2)=⋆C(2), defined component-
wise in Eq. (E25). As the prescription for the Hodge dual ex-
plicitly depends on the dimension of the manifold considered,
we need to discuss separately the case of 4D resp. 6D BZ.
For models with 4D BZ, C(2),i1i2i3i4has only one indepen-
dent component, which is turned into a pseudoscalar
C(2)=1
4!C(2),i1i2i3i4ϵi1i2i3i4(E61)
under the Hodge map, where ϵis the Levi-Civita symbol. The
inverse relation reads
C(2),j1j2j3j4=C(2)ϵj1j2j3j4. (E62)
To identify the implications of Eq. (E60) on C(2), we multiply
that equation by1
4!ϵi1i2i3i4, and apply the definition (E61) on
the left-hand side and the inverse relation (E62) on the right-
hand side; this results in
C(2)=1
4!ϵi1i2i3i4ϵj1j2j3j4Mj1
i1Mj2
i2Mj3
i3Mj4
i4C(2). (E63)
In Eq. (E63) we recognize the standard expression for the de-
terminant of a 4×4 matrix in terms of its components and two
Levi-Civita symbols [63]. It follows that the second Chern
number in the 4D BZ is constrained by
C(2)=(detMg)C(2) (E64)
in the presence of (unitary or antiunitary) symmetry gthat acts
in momentum-space with point-group matrix Mg. This result
corresponds to Eq. (10) in the main text.
Finally, for models with 6D BZ, C(2),i1i2i3i4has 15 indepen-
dent components, which are via
Ck5k6
(2)=1
4!C(2),i1i2i3i4ϵi1i2i3i4k5k6(E65)
arranged into a skew-symmetrix 6 ×6 matrix. The inverse
relation reads
C(2),j1j2j3j4=1
2!Cℓ5ℓ6
(2)ϵj1j2j3j4ℓ5ℓ6. (E66)
To find the implications of Eq. (E60) on elements of matrix
C(2), we first multiply that equation by1
4!ϵi1i2i3i4j5j6, and we
then apply the definition (E65) on the left-hand side and the
inverse relation (E66) on the right-hand side; this produces
Ck5k5
(2)=1
4!1
2!ϵi1i2i3i4k5k6ϵj1j2j3j4ℓ5ℓ6Mj1
i1Mj2
i2Mj3
i3Mj4
i4Cℓ5ℓ6
(2). (E67)
To simplify the above equation, we use the identity [89]
1
(d−m)!×m!ϵi1···id−mkd−m+1···kdϵj1···jd−mℓd−m+1···ℓdMj1
i1···Mjd−m
id−mαℓd−m+1···ℓd=(detM)(M−1)kd−m+1
ℓd−m+1···(M−1)kd
ℓdαℓd−m+1···ℓd(E68)40
that holds for any invertible matrix Mandm-formα(i.e., a
fully skew-symmetric array αof degree m). Knowing that
C(2)is skew-symmetric in its superscript indices, one can use
the above identity to rewrite Eq. (E67) into
Ck5k6
(2)=(detM)(M−1)k5
ℓ5(M−1)k6
ℓ6Cℓ5ℓ6
(2). (E69)
Since for M∈GL(2g,Z) we have (det M)2=1, we can move
the determinant to the other side of the equation. We finally
multiply Eq. (E69) with Mi5
k5Mi6
k6, and bring it into matrix
multiplication form. We find that
C(2)=(detMg)MgC(2)M⊤
g (E70)
in the presence of a (unitary or antiunitary) symmetry gthat
acts in momentum-space with point-group matrix Mg. This
result corresponds to Eq. (11) in the main text.
Appendix F: Symmetry-constrained Chern matrices
We here evaluate the general constraints on the Chern num-
bers inside the hyperbolic BZ. This is achieved by combining
the general equations derived in Appendix E with the specific
form of the point-group matrices Mglisted in Appendix D.
The discussion for hyperbolic Haldane models is subdivided
into Appendix F 1 focused on matrices of first Chern num-
bers, followed by Appendix F 2 that discusses second Chern
numbers. A concise summary of these results is o ffered in Ta-
ble II in the main text. Finally, in Appendix F 3 we present the
matrices of first Chern numbers of the generalized Haldane
model with modified flux patterns on {6,4}lattice, considered
in the discussion in Sec. IV of the main text.
1. Matrices of first Chern numbers
We first study how Eq. (E45) constrains the matrix of first
Chern numbers for the Haldane models on {p,q}lattices with
a 4D BZ. In the absence of sublattice mass, we evaluate using
Wolfram Mathematica that equation for g∈{aT,bT,cT},
obtaining the following results. For the {8,3}and{8,4}Hal-
dane models:
C{8,3}
(1),m=0=C{8,4}
(1),m=0=0 C12−C12C12
−C12 0 C12−C12
C12−C12 0 C12
−C12C12−C12 0,(F1)for the{6,4}Haldane model:
C{6,4}
(1),m=0=0C12 0C12
−C120 0 0
0 0 0 C12
−C120−C120, (F2)
and for the{10,5}Haldane model:
C{10,5}
(1),m=0=C{10,5}
(1),m,0=0 C12 C13C12
−C12 0−C13C13
−C13C13 0C12
−C12−C13−C120. (F3)
We next consider the same lattices in the presence of sublat-
tice mass m,0, in which case Eq. (E45) has to be evaluated
with g∈{P2,bT,cT}. The inclusion of sublattice mass cor-
responds to a reduction in symmetry, and is found to increase
the number of independent first Chern numbers in the matrix
by one. For the{8,3}Haldane model, we obtain:
C{8,3}
(1),m,0=0 C12 C13−C12−2C13
−C12 0−C12−2C13 C13
−C13C12+2C13 0 C12
C12+2C13−C13−C12 0,(F4)
from which one obtains Eq. (F1) by setting C13=−C12. For
the{6,4}Haldane model:
C{6,4}
(1),m,0=0 C12 0 C14
−C12 0−C12+C140
0C12−C14 0 C12
−C14 0−C12 0, (F5)
from which one obtains Eq. (F2) by setting C14=C12. For
the{8,4}Haldane model:
C{8,4}
(1),m,0=0 C12 C13 C12
−C12 0 C12−2C12−C13
−C13−C12 0 C12
−C122C12+C13−C12 0,(F6)
from which one obtains Eq. (F1) by setting C13=C12. For the
{10,5}Haldane model, the inclusion of the mass term does
not alter the general form of the Chern matrix, as explicitly
indicated in Eq. (F3).
We next summarize the symmetry constraints on the matrix
of first Chern numbers for the lattices with a 6D BZ. For the
{7,3}Haldane model:
C{7,3}
(1)=0 0 C13−C13C13 0
0 0 C13 0 0 C13
−C13−C130−C130−C13
C13 0C13 0C13C13
−C13 0 0−C130 0
0−C13C13−C130 0. (F7)
On this lattice one cannot include the sublattice mass because
pis odd. For the{12,3}Haldane model we find:41
C{12,3}
(1),m=0=0 C12 0 C14 0 C12
−C12 0 C12−C12−C14 C14 0
0−C12 0 C12−C12−C14C14
−C14C12+C14−C12 0 C12 0
0−C14C12+C14−C12 0 C12
−C12 0−C14 0−C12 0, (F8)
in the absence of sublattice mass, and
C{12,3}
(1),m,0=0 C12 C13 C14 C13 C12

−C14C12+C13+C14−C12 0 C12+C13−C13
−C13−C13−C14C12+C13+C14−C12−C13 0 C12
−C12 C13−2C13−C14 C13−C12 0, (F9)
in the presence of m. One reduces Eq. (F9) to Eq. (F8) by setting C13=0. For the{12,4}Haldane model we find:
C{12,4}
(1),m=0=0 C12 C13−C12−2C13 C13 C12
−C12 0 C12 C13−C12−2C13 C13
−C13−C12 0 C12 C13−C12−2C13
C12+2C13−C13−C12 0 C12 C13
−C13 C12+2C13−C13−C12 0 C12
−C12−C13 C12+2C13−C13−C12 0, (F10)
in the absence of sublattice mass, and
C{12,4}
(1),m,0=0 C12 C13 C14 C13 C12

in the presence of m. One reduces Eq. (F11) to Eq. (F10) by setting C14=−C12−2C13.
2. Matrices of second Chern numbers
We next analyze the second Chern numbers. First, for models with a 4D BZ there is a single independent second Chern
number, which is constrained by symmetries as given by Eq. (E64). We have discussed in Sec. III C of the main text that this
equation poses no actual restriction for the particular cases of {8,3},{8,4},{6,4}, and{10,5}, i.e., the second Chern number for
Haldane models on each of those lattices is not constrained by symmetry.
Finally, we consider the matrix of second Chern numbers for Haldane models on lattices with a 6D BZ. By combining Eq. (11)
with the point-group matrices Mglisted in Appendix D, we find the following symmetry-constrained forms of the matrices of
second Chern numbers. For the {7,3}lattice, we obtain:
C{7,3}
(2)=0C12C120 0−C12
−C120C12C120 0
−C12−C120C12C120
0−C12−C120C12C12
0 0−C12−C120C12
C120 0−C12−C120. (F12)
For{12,3}in the absence of the sublattice mass, we obtain:
C{12,3}
(2),m=0=0 C12C12C14C14−C12C14−C12
−C120 C12C12C14C14−C12
−C12−C120C12C12C14
−C14−C12−C120 C12C12
C12−C14−C14−C12−C120 C12
C12−C14C12−C14−C14−C12−C120, (F13)42
whereas in the presence of mwe find
C{12,3}
(2),m,0=0 C12C13C14−2C12+C13+C14C14−C12
−C120 C122C12−C13C14C14−C13
−C13−C120 C12C13C14
−C14C13−2C12−C120 C122C12−C13
2C12−C13−C14−C14−C13−C120 C12
C12−C14C13−C14−C14C13−2C12−C120. (F14)
One observes that the e ffect of setting m=0 on the{12,3}lattice is that C13=C12. Note that the structure of the matrices
C{12,3}
(2),m=0andC{12,3}
(2),m,0of second Chern numbers is different from the structure of matrices C{12,3}
(1),m=0andC{12,3}
(1),m,0of first Chern
numbers [see Eqs. (F8) and (F9)].
Finally, for{12,4}in the absence of the sublattice mass we obtain:
C{12,4}
(2),m=0=0 C12 C13 2C13−C12 C13 C12
−C12 0 C12 C13 2C13−C12 C13
−C13−C12 0 C12 C13 2C13−C12
C12−2C13−C13−C12 0 C12 C13
−C13 C12−2C13−C13−C12 0 C12
−C12−C13 C12−2C13−C13−C12 0, (F15)
whereas in the presence of mwe find
C{12,4}
(2),m,0=0 C12 C13 C14 C13 C12
−C12 0 C12C12−C13+C14C14C12−C13+C14
−C13−C12 0 C12 C13 C14
−C14−C12+C13−C14−C12 0 C12C12−C13+C14
−C13−C14−C13−C12 0 C12
−C12−C12+C13−C14−C14−C12+C13−C14−C12 0. (F16)
One observes that the e ffect of setting m=0 in the{12,4}lattice amonths to the condition C14=2C13−2C12. As above, the
structure of the matrices C{12,4}
(2),m=0andC{12,4}
(2),m,0of second Chern numbers is again different from the structure of matrices C{12,4}
(1),m=0
andC{12,4}
(1),m,0of first Chern numbers [see Eqs. (F10) and (F11)].
3. Generalized Haldane models on {6,4}lattice
In Sec. IV of the main text we consider generalized Hal-
dane models on the {6,4}lattice, which are characterized by
three Z2={±1}numbers ( sa,sb,sc). These numbers indicate
the composition ( sj= +1) resp. the absence of a composition
(sj=−1) of reflections a,b,cwith the operator of time re-
versalT, and they relate the magnetic flux through adjacent
Schwarz triangles as illustrated in Fig. 7 of the main text.
Let us use the symbol C{6,4},(sa,sb,sc)
(1),m=0to indicate the
symmetry-constrained matrix of first Chern number for the
generalized Haldane model on the {6,4}lattice in the absence
of sublattice mass and for a flux pattern characterized by signs
(sa,sb,sc). By properly adjusting the signs ςj=−sj= +1
resp.ςjT=−sj=−1 in Eq. (E47), we find the following
nontrivial results [51]. With generators aT,b,cTwe obtain
C{6,4},(+,−,+)
(1),m=0=0 0 C130
0 0 0 C13
−C13 0 0 0
0−C130 0, (F17)with generators aT,b,cwe find the result
C{6,4},(+,−,−)
(1),m=0=0 0 C13 0
0 0 0−C13
−C130 0 0
0C130 0, (F18)
whereas with generators a,bT,cTwe derive
C{6,4},(−,+,+)
(1),m=0=0 C12 0−C12
−C12 0−2C12 0
0 2 C12 0 C12
C12 0−C12 0. (F19)
The results in Eqs. (F17–F19) are nontrivial in the sense that
some of the momentum-space Chern numbers can be nonzero
despite the presence of reflection symmetry in the correspond-
ing models, which is known to enforce vanishing real-space
Chern number. In contrast, the obtained results are trivial for
the the other five combinations of ( sa,sb,sc), namely: when
the triplet of signs is either of ( +,+,−), (−,+,−), (−,−,+),
(−,−,−), then the momentum-space Chern number are all
zero as intuitively expected in the presence of reflection sym-
metry; on the other hand, for ( +,+,+) there are no reflection
symmetries and we get back to the result in Eq. (F2).43
