FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL BOREL FLOWS
KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY
ABSTRACT . Katok’ s special representation theorem states that any fr ee ergodic measure-
preserving Rd-ﬂow can be realized as a special ﬂow over a Zd-action. It provides a mul-
tidimensional generalization of the “ﬂow under a function” construction. We prove the
analog of Katok’ s theorem in the framework of Borel dynamics and show that, likewise,
all free Borel Rd-ﬂows emerge from Zd-actions through the special ﬂow construction
using bi-Lipschitz cocycles.
1. I NTRODUCTION
1.1. Overview. Theorems of Ambrose and Kakutani [1, 2] established a connec tion be-
tween measure-preserving Z-actions and R-ﬂows by showing that any ﬂow admits a
cross-section and can be represented as a “ﬂow under a functi on” . Their construction
provides a foundation for the theory of Kakutani equivalenc e (also called monotone
equivalence) [7, 11] on the one hand and study of the possible ceiling functions in the
“ﬂow under a function” representation [16, 21] on the other.
The intuitive geometric picture of a “ﬂow under a function” d oes not generalize to Rd-
ﬂows for d≥2. However, Katok [12] re-interpreted it in a way that can rea dily be adapted
to the multidimensional setup, calling ﬂows appearing in th is construction special ﬂows .
Despite their name, they aren’t so special, since, as showed in the same paper, every free
ergodic measure-preserving Rd-ﬂow is metrically isomorphic to a special ﬂow. Just like
the works of Ambrose and Kakutani, it opened gates for the stu dy of multidimensional
concepts of Kakutani equivalence [5] and stimulated resear ch on tilings of ﬂows [15,22].
Borel dynamics as a separate ﬁeld goes back to the work of Weis s [31] and has blos-
somed into a versatile branch of dynamical systems. The phas e space here is a standard
Borel space ( X,B), i.e., a set Xwith a σ-algebra Bof Borel sets for some Polish topol-
ogy on X. Some of the key ergodic theoretical results have their coun terparts in Borel
dynamics, while others do not generalize. For example, Bore l version of the Ambrose–
Kakutani Theorem on the existence of cross-sections in R-ﬂows was proved by Wagh
in [30] showing that, just like in ergodic theory, all free Bo relR-ﬂows emerge as “ﬂows
under a function” over Borel Z-actions. Likewise, Rudolph’s two-valued theorem [21]
generalizes to the Borel framework [25]. The theory of Kakut ani equivalence, on the
other hand, exhibits a different phenomenon. While being a h ighly non-trivial equiv-
alence relation among measure-preserving ﬂows [9, 20], des criptive set theoretical ver-
sion of Kakutani equivalence collapses entirely [19].
Considerable work has been done to understand the Borel dyna mics of R-ﬂows, but
relatively few things are known about multidimensional act ions. This paper makes a
contribution in this direction by showing that the analog of Katok’s special representa-
tion theorem does hold for free Borel Rd-ﬂows.

1.2. Structure of the paper. Constructions of orbit equivalent Rd-actions often rely on
(essential) hyperﬁniteness and use covers of orbits of the ﬂ ow by coherent and exhaus-
tive regions. This is the case for the aforementioned paper o f Katok [12], and related
approaches have been used in the descriptive set theoretica l setup as well (e.g., [26]).
Particular assumptions on such coherent regions, however, depend on the speciﬁc ap-
plication. Section 2 distills a general language of partial actions, in which many of the
aforementioned constructions can be formulated. As an appl ication we show that the
orbit equivalence relation generated by a free R-ﬂow can also be generated by a free
action of any non-discrete and non-compact Polish group (see Theorem 2.6 ). This is
in a striking contrast with the actions of discrete groups, w here a probability measure-
preserving free Z-action can be generated only by a free action of an amenable g roup.
Section 3 does the technical work of constructing Lipschitz maps that are needed
for Theorem 3.12, which shows, roughly speaking, that up to a n arbitrarily small bi-
Lipschitz perturbation, any free Rd-ﬂow admits an integer grid—a Borel cross-section
invariant under the Zd-action.
Finally, Section 4 discusses the descriptive set theoretic al version of Katok’s special
ﬂow construction and shows in Theorem 4.3 that, indeed, any f reeRd-ﬂow can be rep-
resented as a special ﬂow generated by a bi-Lipschitz cocycl e with Lipschitz constants
arbitrarily close to 1. This provides a Borel version of Kato k’s special representation the-
orem.
2. S EQUENCES OF PARTIAL ACTIONS
We begin by discussing the framework of partial actions suit able for constructing
orbit equivalent actions. Throughout this section, Xdenotes a standard Borel space.
2.1. Partial actions. LetGbe a standard Borel group, that is a group with a structure of
a standard Borel space that makes group operations Borel. A partial G-action1is a pair
(E,φ), where Eis a Borel equivalence relation on Xandφ:X→Gis a Borel map that is
injective on each E-class: φ(x)/negationslash=φ(y) whenever xE y . The map φitself may occasionally
be refer to as a partial action when the equivalence relation is clear from the context.
The motivation for the name comes from the following observa tion. Consider the set
Aφ=/braceleftbig
(g,x,y)∈G×X×X:xE y and gφ(x)=φ(y)/bracerightbig
.
Injectivity of φonE-classes ensures that for each x∈Xand g∈Gthere is at most one
y∈Xsuch that ( g,x,y)∈Aφ. When such a yexists, we say that the action of gonx
is deﬁned and set g x=y. Clearly, ( e,x,x)∈Aφfor all x∈X, thus ex=x; also g2(g1x)=
(g2g1)xwhenever all the terms are deﬁned. The set Aφis a graph of a total action G/archrightdownX
if and only if for each x∈Xand g∈Gthere does exist some y∈Xsuch that ( g,x,y)∈Aφ;
in this case the orbit equivalence relation generated by the action coincides with E.
Example 2.1.An easy way of getting a partial action is by restricting a tot al one. Suppose
we have a free Borel action G/archrightdownXwith the corresponding orbit equivalence relation EG
and suppose that a Borel equivalence sub-relation E⊆EGadmits a Borel selector—a
Borel E-invariant map π:X→Xsuch that xEπ(x) for all x∈X. Ifφ:X→Gis the map
speciﬁed uniquely by the condition φ(x)π(x)=x, then ( E,φ) is a partial G-action.
Sub-relations Eas in Example 2.1 are often associated with cross-sections o f actions
of locally compact second countable (lcsc) groups.
1More precisely, we should call such ( E,φ) a partial free action. Since we are mainly concerned with free
actions in what follows, we choose to omit the adjective “fre e” in the deﬁnition.KATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 3
2.2. Tessellations of lcsc group actions. Consider a free Borel action G/archrightdownXof a locally
compact second countable group. A cross-section of the action is a Borel set C⊆Xthat
intersects every orbit in a countable non-empty set. A cross -section C⊆Xis
•discrete if (K x)∩Cis ﬁnite for every x∈Xand compact K⊆G;
•U-lacunary , where U⊆Gis a neighborhood of the identity, if Uc∩C={c} for
allc∈C;
•lacunary if it is U-lacunary for some neighborhood of the identity U;
•cocompact ifKC=Xfor some compact K⊆G.
LetCbe a lacunary cross-section for G/archrightdownX, which exists by [13, Corollary 1.2]. Any lcsc
group Gadmits a compatible left-invariant proper metric [28], and any left-invariant
metric dcan be transferred to orbits due to freeness of the action via dist( x,y)=d(g,e)
for the unique g∈Gsuch that g x=y. One can now deﬁne the so-called Voronoi tes-
sellation of orbits by associating with each x∈Xthe closest point πC(x)∈Cof the
cross-section Cas determined by dist. Properness of the metric ensures that , for a ball
BR⊆Gof radius R,BR={g∈G:d(g,e)≤R}, and any x∈X, the set C∩BRxis ﬁnite.
Indeed, there can be at most λ(BR+r)/λ(Br) points in the intersection, where λis a Haar
measure on the group and r>0 is so small that Brc∩Brc′=∅whenever c,c′∈Care
distinct.
Small care needs to be taken to address the possibility of hav ing several closest points.
For example, one may pick a Borel linear order on Cand associated each xwith the
smallest closest point in the cross-section (see [23, Section 4] or [1 7, Section B.2] for the
speciﬁcs). This way we get a Borel equivalence relation EC⊆EGwhose equivalence
classes are the cells of the Voronoi tessellation: xECyif and only if πC(x)=πC(y).
Assumed freeness of the action G/archrightdownXallows for a natural identiﬁcation of each
Voronoi cell with a subset of the acting group via the map π−1
C(c)∋x/mapstochar→φC(x)∈Gsuch
thatφC(x)c=x, which is exactly what the corresponding partial action fro m Exam-
ple 2.1 does.
Our intention is to use partial actions to deﬁne total action s, and the example above
may seem like going “in the wrong direction” . The point, howe ver, is that once we have
a partial action φ:X→G, we can compose it with an arbitrary Borel injection f:G→
Gto get a different partial action f◦φ. This pattern is typical in the sense that new
partial actions are often constructed by modifying those ob tained as restrictions of total
actions.
2.3. Convergent sequences of partial actions. A total action can be deﬁned whenever
we have a sequence of partial actions that cohere in the appro priate sense. Let Gbe a
standard Borel group. A sequence ( En,φn),n∈N, of partial G-actions on Xis said to be
convergent if it satisﬁes the following properties:
•monotonicity: equivalence relations Enform an increasing sequence, that is
En⊆En+1for all n;
•coherence: for each nthe map x/mapstochar→(φn(x))−1φn+1(x) isEn-invariant;
•exhaustiveness: for all x∈Xand all g∈Gthere exist nand y∈Xsuch that
xEnyand gφn(x)=φn(y).
With such a sequence one can associate a free Borel (left) act ionG/archrightdownX, called the limit
of (En,φn)n, whose graph is/uniontext
nAφn. Coherence ensures that the partial action deﬁned
byφn+1is an extension of the one given by φn. Indeed, if xEnyare such that gφn(x)=4 KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY
φn(y), then also xEn+1yby monotonicity and, using coherence,
gφn+1(x)=gφn(x)(φn(x))−1φn+1(x)=φn(y)(φn(y))−1φn+1(y)=φn+1(y),
whence Aφn⊆Aφn+1. IfCis an En-class, and s=(φn(x))−1φn+1(x) for some x∈C, then
φn+1(C)=φn(C)s, so the image φn(C) gets shifted on the right inside φn+1(C). If we
want to build a right action of the group, then φn(C) should be shifted on the left instead.
Finally, exhaustiveness guarantees that g xgets deﬁned eventually: for all g∈Gand
x∈Xthere are nand y∈Xsuch that ( g,x,y)∈Aφn. It is straightforward to check that/uniontext
nAφnis a graph of a total Borel action G/archrightdownX. Equally easy is to check that the action
is free, and its orbits are precisely the equivalence classe s of/uniontext
nEn.
This framework, general as it is, delegates most of the compl exity to the construction
of maps φn. Let us illustrate these concepts on essentially hyperﬁnit e actions of lcsc
groups.
2.4. Hyperﬁnite tessellations of lcsc group actions. In the context of Section 2.2, sup-
pose that, furthermore, the restriction of the orbit equiva lence relation EGonto the
cross-section Cis hyperﬁnite, i.e., there is an increasing sequence of ﬁnit e Borel equiv-
alence relations FnonCsuch that/uniontext
nFn=EG|C. We can use this sequence to deﬁne
xEnywhenever πC(x)FnπC(y), which yields an increasing sequence of Borel equiva-
lence relations Ensuch that EG=/uniontext
nEn.
The equivalence relations Fnadmit Borel transversals, i.e., there are Borel sets Cn
that pick exactly one point from each Fn-class. Just as in Section 2.2, we may deﬁne
φn(x) to be such an element g∈Gthat g c=xfor the unique c∈Cnsatisfying xEnc. This
gives a convergent sequence of partial G-actions ( En,φn)nwhose limit is the original
action G/archrightdownX.
2.5. Partial actions revisited. In practice, it is often more convenient to allow equiva-
lence relations Ento be deﬁned on proper subsets of X. Let Xn⊆X,n∈N, be Borel
subsets, and suppose for each n,Enis a Borel equivalence relation on Xn. We say that
the sequence ( En)nismonotone if the following conditions are satisﬁed for all m≤n:
•Em|Xm∩Xn⊆En|Xm∩Xn;
•ifx∈Xm∩Xnthen the whole Em-class of xis in Xn.
Partial action maps φn:Xn→G, where, as earlier, Gis a standard Borel group, need
to satisfy the appropriate versions of coherence and exhaus tiveness:
•coherence :Xm∩Xn∋x/mapstochar→(φm(x))−1φn(x) isEm-invariant for each m<n;
•exhaustiveness : for each x∈Xand g∈Gthere exist nand y∈Xnsuch that
x∈Xn,xEny, and gφn(x)=φn(y).
A sequence of partial G-actions ( Xn,En,φn)nwill be called convergent if it satisﬁes the
above properties of monotonicity, coherence, and exhausti veness. Note that the condi-
tion/uniontext
nXn=Xfollows from exhaustiveness, so sets Xnmust cover all of X.
Convergent sequences ( Xn,En,φn)ndeﬁne total actions, which can be most easily
seen by reducing this setup to the notationally simpler one g iven in Section 2.3. To this
end, extend Ento the equivalence relation ˆEnon all of Xby
xˆEny⇐⇒ ∃ m≤n xE myorx=y;
and also extend φntoˆφn:X→Gby setting ˆφn(x)=φm(x) for the maximal m≤nsuch
that x∈Xmorˆφn(x)=eif no such mexists. It is straightforward to check that ( ˆEn,ˆφn)n
is a convergent sequence of partial G-actions in the sense of Section 2.3. By the limit ofKATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 5
the sequence of partial actions ( Xn,En,φn)nwe mean the limit of ( ˆEn,ˆφn)nas deﬁned
earlier.
Remark 2.2.A variant of this generalized formulation, which we encount er in Propo-
sition 2.4 below, occurs when sets Xnare nested: X0⊆X1⊆X2⊆ ··· . Monotonicity
of equivalence relations then simpliﬁes to E0⊆E1⊆E2⊆ ··· and coherence becomes
equivalent to the En-invariant of maps Xn∋x/mapstochar→(φn(x))−1φn+1(x)∈G.
As was mentioned above, it is easy to create new partial actio ns simply by composing
a partial action φ:X→Gwith some Borel bijection f:G→G(orf:G→Hif we choose
to have values in a different group). However, an arbitrary b ijection has no reasons to
preserve coherence and extra care is necessary to maintain i t.
Furthermore, in general we need to apply different modiﬁcat ions fto different En-
classes, which naturally raises concern of how to ensure tha t construction is performed
in a Borel way. In applications, the modiﬁcation fapplied to an En-class C, usually
depends on the “shape” of Cand the Em-classes it contains, but does not depend on
other En-classes. If there are only countably many such “conﬁgurati ons” of En-classes,
resulting partial actions f◦φwill be Borel as long as we consistently apply the same
modiﬁcation whenever “conﬁgurations” are the same. This id ea can be formalized as
follows.
2.6. Rational sequences of partial actions. Let ( En,φn)nbe a convergent sequence of
partial actions on X. For an En-class C, letEm(C) denote the collection of Em-classes
contained in C. Given two En-classes Cand C′, we denote by φn(C)≡φn(C′) the exis-
tence for each m≤nof a bijection Em(C)∋D/mapstochar→D′∈Em(C′) such that φn(D)=φn(D′)
for all D∈Em(C). Collection of images { φn(D) :D∈/uniontext
m≤nEm(C)} constitutes the “con-
ﬁguration” of Creferred to earlier.
We say that the sequence ( En,φn)nof partial actions is rational if for each nthere
exists a Borel En-invariant partition X=/unionsqtext
kYksuch that for each kone has φn(C)≡
φn(C′) for all En-classes C,C′⊆Yk.
Remark 2.3.This concept of rationality applies verbatim to convergent sequences of
partial actions ( Xn,En,φn)nas described in Section 2.5. One can check that such a se-
quence is rational if and only if the sequence ( ˆEn,ˆφn) is rational.
2.7. Generating the ﬂow equivalence relation. As an application of the partial actions
formalism, we show that any orbit equivalence relation give n by a free Borel R-ﬂow can
also be generated by a free action of any non-discrete and non -compact Polish group.
For this we need the following representation of an R-ﬂow as a limit of partial R-actions.
Proposition 2.4. Any free Borel R-ﬂow on X can be represented as a limit of a convergent
rational sequence of partial R-actions (Xn,En,φn)nsuch that
(1) both X nand E nare increasing: X 0⊆X1⊆··· and E 0⊆E1⊆··· ; (see Remark 2.2)
(2) each E n+1-class contains ﬁnitely many E n-classes;
(3) each E 0-class has cardinality of continuum;
(4) for each E n+1-class C the set C \Xnhas cardinality of continuum.
Proof. AnyR-ﬂow admits a rational2(−4,4)-lacunary cross-section (see [24, Section 2]),
which we denote by C. Let ( EC,φC) be the partial R-action as deﬁned in Section 2.2. If
2Rationality of the cross-section here means that the distan ce between any two points of Cis a rational
number. More generally, rationality of a cross-section Cfor an Rd-action means r∈Qdwhenever c+r=c′
for some c,c′∈C.6 KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY
Dis an EC-class, then φC(D) is an interval. For ǫ>0, let Dǫconsist of those x∈Dsuch
thatφC(x) is at least ǫaway from the boundary points of φC(D). In other words, Dǫis
obtained by shrinking the class Dbyǫfrom each side.
The restriction of the orbit equivalence relation onto Cis hyperﬁnite. This fact is true
in the much wider generality of actions of locally compact Ab elian groups [4]. Speciﬁ-
cally for R-ﬂows, E|Cis generated by the ﬁrst return map—a Borel automorphism of C
that sends a point in Cto the next one according to the order of the R-ﬂow. The ﬁrst
return map is well deﬁned and is invertible, except for the or bits, where Chappens to
have the maximal or the minimal point. The latter part of the s pace evidently admits a
Borel selector and is therefore smooth, hence won’t affect h yperﬁniteness of the equiv-
alence relation. It remains to recall the standard fact that orbit equivalence relations of
Z-actions are hyperﬁnite (see, for instance, [6, Theorem 5.1 ]), and thus so is the restric-
tion E|C.
In particular, we can represent the R-ﬂow as the limit of a convergent sequence of
partial actions ( E′
n,φ′
n)nas described in Section 2.4. Note that ( E′
n,φ′
n)nis necessarily
rational by rationality of C. Such a sequence satisﬁes items (2) and (3), but fails (4).
We ﬁx this by shrinking equivalence classes to achieve prope r containment. Let ( ǫn)n
be a strictly decreasing sequence of positive reals such tha t 1>ǫ0and lim nǫn=0. Put
X′
n=/uniontextDǫn, where the union is taken over all EC-classes D. Note that sets X′
nfail to
cover X, because the boundary points of any EC-class do not belong to any of X′
n. Put
Y=X\/uniontext

nand let Xn=X′
n∪Y. Clearly, ( Xn)nis an increasing sequence of Borel sets
and/uniontext
nXn=X.
Finally, set En=E′
n|Xnandφn:Xn→Rto be φ′
n|Xn. The sequence ( Xn,En,φn)nof
partial R-actions satisﬁes the conditions of the proposition. /square
All non-smooth orbit equivalence relations produced by fre e Borel R-ﬂows are Borel
isomorphic to each other [14, Theorem 3]. Theorem 2.6 will sh ow that this orbit equiv-
alence relation can also be generated by a free action of any n on-compact and non-
discrete Polish group.
LetGbe a group. We say that a set A⊆Gadmits inﬁnitely many disjoint right trans-
lates if there is a sequence ( gn)nof elements of Gsuch that Agm∩Agn=/emptysetstress for all m/negationslash=n.
Lemma 2.5. Let G be a non-compact Polish group. There exists a neighborh ood of the
identity V ⊆G such that for any ﬁnite F ⊆G the set V F admits inﬁnitely many disjoint
right translates.
Proof. We begin with the following characterization of compactnes s established inde-
pendently by Solecki [27, Lemma 1.2] and Uspenskij [29]: a Po lish group Gis non-
compact if and only if there exists a neighborhood of the iden tity U⊆Gsuch that
F1U F 2/negationslash=Gfor all ﬁnite F1,F2⊆G. Let V⊆Gbe a symmetric neighborhood of the iden-
tity such that V2⊆U. We claim that such a set Vhas the desired property. Pick a ﬁnite
F⊆G, set g0=eand choose gninductively as follows. Let F1=F−1and F2,n=F·{gk:k<
n}. The deﬁning property of Uassures existence of gn/negationslash∈F1U F 2,n. Translates ( V F g n)n
are then pairwise disjoint, for if V F g m∩V F g n/negationslash=/emptysetstress form<n, then gn∈F−1V−1V F g m⊆
F1U F 2,n, contradicting the construction. /square
Theorem 2.6. Let E be an orbit equivalence relation given by a free Borel R-ﬂow on X .
Any non-discrete non-compact Polish group G admits a free Bo rel action G /archrightdownX such
that E G=E.KATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 7
Proof. Let ( Xn,En,φn)nbe a convergent sequence of partial R-actions as in Proposi-
tion 2.4 and let V⊆Gbe given by Lemma 2.5. Choose a countable dense ( hn)ninG
so that/uniontext

for each na Borel En-invariant partition Xn=/unionsqtext
kYn,ksuch that φn(C)≡φn(C′) for
allEn-classes C,C′⊆Yn,k. We construct a convergent sequence of partial G-actions
(Xn,En,ψn)nsuch that for each nand kthere exists a ﬁnite set F⊆Gsuch that { hi:i<
n}⊆Fandψn(C)=V F for all En-classes C⊆Yn,k.
For any E0-class C, both φ0(C)⊆Rand V⊆Gare Borel sets of the same cardinality.
We may therefore pick a Borel bijection fk:φ0(C)→Vwhere C⊆Y0,k. For the base of
the inductive construction we set ψ0|Yk=fk◦φ0. Suppose that ψm:Xm→G,m≤n,
have been constructed.
We now construct ψn+1. Let Cbe an En+1-class and let D1,... , Dlbe a complete
list of En-classes contained in C. By the inductive assumption, there are ﬁnite sets
F1,... , Fl⊆Gsuch that ψn(Di)=V F i. Let ˜F=/uniontext
i≤lFi. By the choice of V, there are
elements g1,... , gl∈Gsuch that V˜F g i, are pairwise disjoint for 1 ≤i≤l. Pick a ﬁnite

as in the base case, the same modiﬁcation fworks for all classes En+1-classes C,C′such
thatφn+1(C)≡φn+1(C′), which ensures Borelness of the construction.
It is now easy to check that ( Xn,En,ψn)nis a convergent sequence of partial G-actions,
hence its limit is a free Borel action G/archrightdownXsuch that EG=E. /square
Remark 2.7.Theorem 2.6 highlights difference with actions of discrete groups, since a
free Borel Z-action that preserves a ﬁnite measure cannot be generated b y a free Borel
action of a non-amenable group (see, for instance, [32, Prop osition 4.3.3] or [10, Propo-
sition 2.5(ii)]).
However, if we consider hyperﬁnite equivalence relations w ithout any ﬁnite invari-
ant measures, then we do have the analog for Z-actions. There exists a unique up to
isomorphism non-smooth hyperﬁnite Borel equivalence rela tion without any ﬁnite in-
variant measures and it can be realized as an orbit equivalen ce relation of a free action
of any inﬁnite countable group [6, Proposition 11.2].
3. L IPSCHITZ MAPS
Our goal in this section is to prove Theorem 3.12, which shows that any free Borel Rd-
ﬂow is bi-Lipschitz orbit equivalent to a ﬂow with an integer grid. Sections 3.1–3.3 build
the necessary tools to construct such an orbit equivalence. Veriﬁcation of the Lipschitz
conditions stated in the lemmas within these sections is str aightforward and routine.
We therefore omit the arguments in the interest of brevity.
Recall that a map f:X→Ybetween metric spaces ( X,dY) and ( Y,dY) isK-Lipschitz
ifdY(f(x1),f(x2))≤K d X(x1,x2) for all x1,x2∈X, and it is ( K1,K2)-bi-Lipschitz iffis
injective, K2-Lipschitz, and f−1isK−1
1-Lipschitz, which can equivalently be stated as
K1dX(x1,x2)≤dY(f(x1),f(x2))≤K2dX(x1,x2) for all x1,x2∈X.8 KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY

3.1. Linked sets. Given two Lipschitz maps f:A→A′and g:B→B′that agree on the
intersection A∩B, the map f∪g:A∪B→A′∪B′, in general, may not be Lipschitz.
The following condition is sufﬁcient to ensure that f∪gis Lipschitz with the Lipschitz
constant bounded by the maximum of the constants of fand g.
Deﬁnition 3.1. Let ( X,d) be a metric space and A,B⊆Xbe its subsets. We say that
Aand Bare linked if for all x∈Aand y∈Bthere exists z∈A∩Bsuch that d(x,y)=
d(x,z)+d(z,y).
Lemma 3.2. Let (X,d)be a metric space, f :A→A′, g:B→B′be K -Lipschitz maps
between subsets of X and suppose that f |A∩B=g|A∩B. If A and B are linked, then f ∪g:
A∪B→A′∪B′is K -Lipschitz.
Recall that a metric space ( X,d) isgeodesic if for all points x,y∈Xthere exists a geo-
desic between them—an isometry τ:/bracketleftbig
0,d(x,y)/bracketrightbig
→Xsuch that τ(0)=xandτ/parenleftbig
d(x,y)/parenrightbig
=
y. For geodesic metric spaces, closed sets A,B⊆Xare always linked whenever the
boundary of one of them is contained in the other. The boundar y of a set Awill be
denoted by ∂A, and int Awill stand for the interior of A.
Lemma 3.3. Suppose (X,d)is a geodesic metric space. If A ,B⊆X are closed and satisfy
∂A⊆B, then A and B are linked.
3.2. Inductive step. The following lemma encompasses the inductive step in the co n-
struction of the forthcoming Theorem 3.12.
Lemma 3.4. Let (X,d)be a geodesic metric space and A ⊆X be a closed set. Suppose
(Ai)n
i=1are pairwise disjoint closed subsets of A and h i:Ai→Aiare(K1,K2)-bi-Lipschitz
maps such that h i|∂Aiis the identity map for each 1≤i≤n. The map g :A→A given by
g(x)=/braceleftBigg
hi(x)if x∈Ai,
x otherwise
is(K1,K2)-bi-Lipschitz.
3.3. Lipschitz shifts. Let ( X,/bardbl·/bardbl) be a normed space and let A⊆Xbe a closed bounded
subset. We begin with the following elementary and well-kno wn observation regarding
Lipschitz perturbations of the identity map.
Lemma 3.5. Ifξ:A→X is a K -Lipschitz map, K <1, then A ∋x/mapstochar→x+ξ(x)∈X is
(1−K,1+K)-bi-Lipschitz.
For the rest of Section 3.3, we ﬁx a vector v∈Xand a real K>||v||. Let the function
fA,K,v:A→Xbe given by
fA,K,v(x)=x+d(x,∂A)
Kv,
where d(x,∂A) denotes the distance from xto the boundary of A. This function (as
well as its variant to be introduced shortly) is (1 −K−1||v||,1+K−1||v||)-bi-Lipschitz. To
simplify the notation, we set α+=1+K−1||v||andα−=1−K−1||v||.
Lemma 3.6. The function f A,K,vis an (α−,α+)-bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism onto A.
Fix a real L>0 and let AL={x∈A:d(x,∂A)≥L} be the set of those elements that are
at least Lunits of distance away from the boundary of A.KATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 9
Lemma 3.7. fA,K,v|AL=fAL,K,v+LK−1v and f A,K,v(AL)=AL+LK−1v.
A truncated shift function hA,K,v,L:A→Xis deﬁned by
hA,K,v,L(x)=/braceleftBigg
fA,K,v(x) for x∈A\AL,
x+LK−1vforx∈AL.
Lemma 3.8. The function h A,K,v,Lis an (α−,α+)-bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism onto A.
3.4. Lipschitz equivalence to grid ﬂows. The maps hA,K,v,Lcan be used to show that
any free Borel Rd-ﬂow is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to a ﬂow admitting an intege r grid. This
is the content of Theorem 3.12, but ﬁrst we formulate the prop erties of partial actions
needed for the construction. This is an adaption of the so-ca lled unlayered toast con-
struction announced in [8]. The proof given in [18, Appendix A] forZd-actions, transfers
toRd-ﬂows.
For the rest of the paper, we ﬁx a norm ||·|| onRdand let d(x,y)= ||x−y||be the
corresponding metric on Rd. Recall that BR(r)⊆Rddenotes a closed ball of radius R
centered at r∈Rd.
Lemma 3.9. Let K>0be a positive real. Any free Rd-ﬂow on a standard Borel space X is
a limit of a rational convergent sequence of partial actions (Xn,En,φn)n(see Section 2.5)
such that for each E n-class C
(1)φn(C)is a closed and bounded subset of Rdand B K(0)⊆φn(C);
(2) the set of E m-classes, m ≤n, contained in C is ﬁnite;
(3) d (φn(D),∂φn(C))≥K for any E m-class D such that D ⊆C.
Before outlining the proof, we need to introduce some notati on. Let E1,... , Enbe
equivalence relations on X1,... , Xnrespectively. By E1∨···∨ Enwe mean the equivalence
relation Eon/uniontext
i≤nXigenerated by Ei, i.e., xE y whenever there exist x1,... , xmand for
each 1≤i≤mthere exists 1 ≤j(i)≤nsuch that x1=x,xm=yand xiEj(i)xi+1for all
1≤i<m.
IfEis an equivalence relation on Y⊆Xand K>0, we deﬁne the relation E+Kon
Y+K={x∈X: dist( x,y)≤Kfor some y∈Y} by x1E+Kx2if and only if there are y1,y2∈Y
such that dist( x1,y1)≤K, dist( x2,y2)≤Kand y1E y2. Note that in general, E+Kmay not
be an equivalence relation if two E-classes get connected after the “fattening” . However,
E+Kis an equivalence relation if dist( C1,C2)>2Kholds for all distinct E-classes C1,C2.
Proof of Lemma 3.9. One starts with a sufﬁciently fast-growing sequence of radi ian(say,
an=K1000n+1is fast enough) and chooses using [3] (see also [18, Lemma A.2 ]) a se-
quence of Borel Ban(0)-lacunary cross-sections Cn⊆Xsuch that
(1) ∀x∈X∀ǫ>0∃∞nsuch that dist( x,Cn)<ǫan,
where dist( x,Cn)=inf{dist( x,c) :c∈Cn} and∃∞stands for “there exist inﬁnitely many” .
We may assume without loss of generality that cross-section sCnare rational in the
sense that if c1+r=c2for some c1,c2∈/uniontext
nCnthen r∈Qd. This can be achieved by
moving elements of Cnby an arbitrarily small amount (see [24, Lemma 2.4]) which
maintains the property given in Eq. (1). Rationality of cros s-sections guarantees that
the sequence of partial actions constructed below is ration al.
One now deﬁnes Xnand Eninductively with the base X0=C0+Ba0/10(0), and xE0y
if and only if there is c∈C0such that x,y∈c+Ba0/10(0). For the inductive step, begin
with ˜Xn=Cn+Ban/10(0) and ˜Enbeing given analogously to the base case: x˜Enyif and10 KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY
only if there is some c∈Cnsuch that dist( x,c)≤an/10 and dist( y,c)≤an/10. Set E′
n=

n=˜Xn∪/uniontextn−1

n. Finally, let Xnbe
theE′
n-saturation of ˜Xn, i.e., x∈Xnif and only if there exists y∈˜Xnsuch that xE′
ny. Put
En=E′
n|Xn.
An alternative description of an En-class is as follows. One starts with an ˜En-class Cn
and joins it ﬁrst with all E+K
n−1-classes Dthat intersect Cn. Let the resulting ˜En∨E+K
n−1-
class be denoted by Cn−1. Next we add all E+K
n−2-classes that intersect Cn−2producing an
˜En∨E+K
n−1∨E+K
n−2-class Cn−2. The process terminates with an En-class C0.
It is easy to check inductively that the diameter of any En-class Csatisﬁes diam( C)≤
an/3 and therefore dist( C1,C2)≥an/3≫2Kfor all distinct En-classes C1,C2by the la-
cunarity of Cn. The latter shows that E+K
nis an equivalence relation on X+K
n.
Monotonicity of the sequence ( Xn,En)nis evident from the construction. Eq. (1) is
crucial for establishing the fact that/uniontext
nXn=X. Indeed, for each x∈Xthere exists some
nsuch that dist( x,Cn)<an/10 and thus also x∈˜Xn⊆Xn.
The maps φn:Xn→Rd, needed to specify partial Rd-actions, are deﬁned by the con-
dition φn(x)c=xfor the unique c∈Cnsuch that cEnx. Note that d(φn(D),∂φn(C))≥K
for any Em-class D,m<n, that is contained in an En-class Cis a consequence of the
fact that D+K⊆Cby the construction. The convergent sequence of partial act ions
(Xn,En,φn)ntherefore satisﬁes the desired properties. /square
LetF1andF2be free Rd-ﬂows on Xthat generate the same orbit equivalence rela-
tion, EF1=EF2, and let ρ=ρF1,F2:Rd×X→Rdbe the associated cocycle map, deﬁned
forx∈Xand r∈Rdby the condition x+2r=x+1ρ(r,x). We say that the cocycle ρis
(K1,K2)-bi-Lipschitz if such is the map ρ(·,x) :Rd→Rdfor all x∈X:
(2) K1||r2−r1||≤||ρ(r2,x)−ρ(r1,x)||≤K2||r2−r1||.
Since ρ(r2,x)−ρ(r1,x)=ρ(r2−r1,x+1r1), Lipschitz condition (2) for a cocycle can be
equivalently and more concisely stated as
(3) K1≤||ρ(r,x)||
||r||≤K2for all x∈Xand r∈Rd\ {0}.
Remark 3.10 .Note that cocycles ρF1,F2andρF2,F1are connected via the identities
ρF1,F2(ρF2,F1(r,x),x)=r and ρF2,F1(ρF1,F2(r,x),x)=r.
In particular, if ρF1,F2is (K1,K2)-bi-Lipschitz, then ρF2,F1is (K−1
2,K−1
1)-bi-Lipschitz.
Deﬁnition 3.11. LetFbe a free Rd-ﬂow on X. An integer grid for the ﬂow Fis aZd-
invariant Borel subset Z⊆Xwhose intersection with each orbit of the ﬂow is a Zd-orbit.
In other words, Z+Rd=X,Z+Zd=Z, and z1+Zd=z2+Zdfor all z1,z2∈Zsuch that
z1EFz2.
Not every ﬂow admits an integer grid, but, as the following th eorem shows, each ﬂow
is bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the one that does.
Theorem 3.12. LetF1be a free Borel Rd-ﬂow on X . For any α>1there exists a free
BorelRd-ﬂowF2on X that admits an integer grid, induces the sames orbit equi valence
as doesF1, i.e., EF1=EF2, and whose associated cocycle ρF1,F2is(α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz.
Proof. Let Rbe so big that the ball BR(0)⊆Rdsatisﬁes Zd+BR(0)=Rd. Choose K>0
large enough to ensure that α−=1−K−1R>α−1, and therefore also α+=1+K−1R<
α. Let ( Xn,En,φn)nbe a rational convergent sequence of partial actions produc ed byKATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 11
Lemma 3.9 for the chosen value of K. For an En-class C, let C′denote the collection of
allx∈Cthat are at least K-distance away from the boundary of C:
C′={x∈C:d(φn(x),∂φn(C))≥K}.
IfDis an Em-class such that D⊆C, then item (3) of Lemma 3.9 guarantees the inclusion

For the base of the construction, set ψ0=φ′
0and Z0=ψ−1
0(Zd). Next, consider a
typical E1-class Cwith D1,... , Dlbeing a complete list of E0-classes contained in it (see
Figure 1). Consider the set ˜ZC′=φ−1
1(Zd)∩C′, which is the integer grid inside C′(marked
by dots in Figure 1). Each of the Di-classes comes with the grid ˜ZD′

icon-
structed at the previous stage (depicted by crosses in Figur e 1). The coherence condition
for partial actions guarantees existence of some si∈Rd,i≤l, such that
φ1(D′
i)=φ0(D′
i)+si=ψ0(D′
i)+si.
In general, the grid ˜ZC′does not contain ˜ZD′
i, but for each i≤l, we can ﬁnd a vector
vi∈Rdof norm ||vi||≤ Rsuch that ˜ZD′
i+1vi⊆˜ZC′. More precisely, we take for viany
vector in BR(0) such that si+vi∈Zd, which exists by the choice of R. Let hi:φ1(Di)→
φ1(Di) be the function hφ1(Di),K,vi,K, which is ( α−,α+)-bi-Lipschitz by Lemma 3.8. Fi-
nally, deﬁne g1:φ1(C′)→φ1(C′) to be
g1(r)=/braceleftBigg
hi(r) if r∈φ1(Di),
r otherwise.12 KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY
Lemma 3.4 has been tailored speciﬁcally to show that g1is (α−,α+)-bi-Lipschitz. We set
ψ1|C′=g1◦φ1|C′. Note that
ψ1(D′
i)=g1◦φ1(D′
i)=hi◦φ1(D′
i)=φ1(D′
i)+K K−1vi
=φ0(D′

which validates coherence and, in view of si+vi∈Zd, gives ψ−1

i=ψ−1
0(Zd)∩D′

for all i≤l.
While we have provided the deﬁnition of ψ1on a single E1-class C, the same con-
struction can be done in a Borel way across all E1-classes Cusing rationality of the se-
quence of partial actions just like we did in Theorem 2.6. If w e let Z1=ψ−1
1(Zd), then
Z0∩X1⊆Z1by Eq. (4).
The general inductive step is analogous. Suppose that we hav e constructed maps ψk
fork≤n. An En+1-class Ccontains ﬁnitely many subclasses D1,... , Dl, where Diis an
Emi-class, mi<n, and no Diis contained in a bigger Em-class for some mi<m<n. By
coherence and inductive assumption, there exist si∈Rd,i≤l, such that
φn+1(D′
i)=φmi(D′
i)+si=ψmi(D′
i)+si.
Choose vectors vi∈BR(0) to satisfy si+vi∈Zd, set hi:φn+1(Di)→φn+1(Di) to be
hφn+1(Di),K,vi,K, and deﬁne an ( α−,α+)-bi-Lipschitz function gn+1by
gn+1(r)=/braceleftBigg
hi(r) if r∈φn+1(Di),
r otherwise.
Finally, set ψn+1|C′=gn+1◦φn+1|C′and extend this deﬁnition to a Borel map ψn+1:
X′
n+1→Rdusing the rationality of the sequence of partial actions. Co herence of the
maps ( ψk)k≤n+1and the inclusion Zm∩X′
n+1⊆Zn+1form≤n+1 follow from the analog
of Eq. (4).
It remains to check the bi-Lipschitz condition for the resul ting cocycle ρF1,F2. It is
easier to work with the cocycle ρF2,F1, which for x,x+r∈X′
nsatisﬁes
ρF2,F1(r,x)=gn(φn(x)+r)−gn(φn(x)),
and is therefore ( α−,α+)-bi-Lipschitz, because so is gn. Hence, ρF2,F1is also ( α−1,α)-bi-
Lipschitz, because α−1<α−<α+<αby the choice of K. Finally, we apply Remark 3.10
to conclude that ρF1,F2is also ( α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz. /square
Restricting the action of F2onto the integer grid Z, we get the following corollary.
Corollary 3.13. LetFbe a free Borel Rd-ﬂow on X . For any α>1there exist a cross-
section Z ⊆X and a free Zd-action T on Z such that the cocycle ρ=ρF,T:Zd×X→Rd
given by T nx=x+ρ(n,x)is(α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz.
4. S PECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM
The main goal of this section is to formulate and prove a Borel version of Katok’s spe-
cial representation theorem [12] that connects free Rd-ﬂows with free Zd-actions. We
have already done most of the work in proving Theorem 3.12, an d it is now a matter of
deﬁning special representations in the Borel context and co nnecting them to our earlier
setup.KATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 13
4.1. Cocycles. Given a Borel action G/archrightdownX, a (Borel) cocycle with values in a group His
a (Borel) map ρ:G×X→Hthat satisﬁes the cocycle identity :
ρ(g2g1,x)=ρ(g2,g1x)ρ(g1,x) for all g1,g2∈Gand x∈X.
We are primarily concerned with the Abelian groups ZdandRdin this section, so the
cocycle identity will be written additively. A cocycle ρ:G×X→His said to be injective
ifρ(g,x)/negationslash=eHfor all g/negationslash=eGand all x∈X, where eGand eHare the identity elements
of the corresponding groups. Suppose that furthermore the g roups Gand Hare locally
compact. We say that ρescapes to inﬁnity if for all x∈X, lim g→∞ρ(g,x)=+∞ in the
sense that for any compact KH⊆Hthere exists a compact KG⊆Gsuch that ρ(g,x)/negationslash∈KH
whenever g/negationslash∈KG.
Example 4.1.Suppose aH:H/archrightdownXand aG:G/archrightdownY,Y⊆X, are free actions of groups G
and Hon standard Borel spaces, and suppose that we have containme nt of orbit equiva-
lence relations EG⊆EH. For each y∈Yand g∈G, there exists a unique ρaH,aG(g,y)∈H
such that aH(ρaH,aG(g,y),y)=aG(g,y). The map ( g,y)/mapstochar→ρaH,aG(g,y) is an injective
Borel cocycle. We have already encountered two instances of this idea in Section 3.4.
4.2. Flow under a function. BorelR-ﬂows and Z-actions are tightly connected through
the “ﬂow under a function” construction. Let T:Z→Zbe a free Borel automorphism of
a standard Borel space and f:Z→R>0be a positive Borel function. There is a natural
deﬁnition of a ﬂow F:R/archrightdownXon the space X={(z,t) :z∈Z,0≤t<f(z)} under the
graph of f. The action ( z,t)+rfor a positive ris deﬁned by shifting the point ( z,t) by
runits upward until the graph of fis reached, then jumping to the point ( T z,0), and
continuing to ﬂow upward until the graph of fatT zis reached, etc. More formally,
(z,t)+r=/parenleftbig

for the unique k≥0 such that/summationtextk−1

i=0f(Tiz); for r≤0 the action is

that the ﬁbers within the orbits of Thave inﬁnite cumulative lengths:
(5)∞/summationdisplay
i=0f(Tiz)=+∞ and∞/summationdisplay
i=0f(T−iz)=+∞ for all z∈Z.
The appealing geometric picture of the “ﬂow under a function ” does not generalize
to higher dimensions, but admits an interpretation as the so -called special ﬂow con-
struction suggested in [12].
4.3. Special ﬂows. Let Tbe a free Zd-action on a standard Borel space Zand let ρ:
Zd×Z→Rdbe a Borel cocycle. One can construct a Zd-action ˆT, the so-called principal
Rd-extension, deﬁned on Z×Rdvia ˆTn(z,r)=(Tnz,r+ρ(n,z)). An easy application of
the cocycle identity veriﬁes axioms of the action. While the action Twill typically have
complicated dynamics, the action ˆTadmits a Borel transversal as long as the cocycle ρ
escapes to inﬁnity.14 KONSTANTIN SLUTSKY
Lemma 4.2. If the cocycle ρsatisﬁes lim n→∞||ρ(n,z)||=+∞ for all z∈Z , then the action
ˆT has a Borel transversal.
Proof. Let Yk={(z,r)∈Z×Rd:||r|| ≤ k}. We claim that each orbit of ˆTintersects Yk
in a ﬁnite (possibly empty) set. Indeed, cocycle values esca ping to inﬁnity yield for any
(z,r)∈Z×Rda number Nso large that ||r+ρ(n,z)||>kwhenever ||n||≥ N. In particular,
||n||≥ Nimplies ˆTn(z,r)=(Tnz,r+ρ(n,z))/negationslash∈Yk. Hence, the intersection of the orbit of
(z,r) with Ykis ﬁnite.
SetY=/unionsqtext
k∈N/parenleftbig
Yk\/uniontext
n∈ZdˆTnYk−1/parenrightbig
. Each orbit of ˆTintersects Yin a ﬁnite and neces-
sarily non-empty set, so EˆT|Yis a ﬁnite Borel equivalence relation. A Borel transversal
forEˆT|Yis also a transversal for the action of ˆT. /square
We assume now that the cocycle ρsatisﬁes the assumptions of Lemma 4.2, and X=
(Z×Rd)/EˆTtherefore carries the structure of a standard Borel space as a push-forward
of the factor map π:Z×Rd→X, which sends a point to its EˆT-equivalence class.
There is a natural Rd-ﬂow ˆFonZ×Rdwhich acts by shifting the second coordinate:
(z,r)+ˆFs=(z,r+s). This ﬂow commutes with the Zd-action ˆTand therefore projects
onto the ﬂow FonXgiven by the condition π((z,r)+ˆFs)=π(z,r)+Fs. We say that Fis
the special ﬂow over Tgenerated by the cocycle ρ. Freeness of Timplies freeness of F.
The construction outlined above, works just as well in the co ntext of ergodic theory,
where the space Zwould be endowed with a ﬁnite measure νpreserved by the action
T. The product of νwith the Lebesgue measure on Rdinduces a measure µonX, which
is preserved by the ﬂow F. Furthermore, µis ﬁnite provided the cocycle ρis integrable
in the sense of [12, Condition (J), p. 122]. Katok’s special r epresentation theorem as-
serts that, up to a null set, any free ergodic measure-preser ving ﬂow can be obtained via
this process. Furthermore, the cocycle can be picked to be bi -Lipschitz with Lipschitz
constants arbitrarily close to 1.
As will be shown shortly, such a representation result conti nues to hold in the frame-
work of descriptive set theory, and every free Borel Rd-ﬂow is Borel isomorphic to a
special ﬂow over some free Borel Zd-action. Moreover, just as in Katok’s original work,
Theorem 4.3 provides some signiﬁcant control on the cocycle that generates the ﬂow,
tightly coupling the dynamics of the Zd-action with the dynamics of the ﬂow it pro-
duces. But ﬁrst, we re-interpret the construction in differ ent terms.
4.4. Flows generated by admissible cocycles. Let the map Z∋z/mapstochar→(z,0)∈Z×{0} be
denoted by ι. If the cocycle ρis injective, then π◦ι:Z→π(Z×{0})=Yis a bijection
and Yintersects every orbit of Fin a non-empty countable set. The Zd-action Ton
Zcan be transferred via π◦ιto give a free Zd-action T′=π◦ι◦T◦ι−1◦π−1onY. Let
ρ′=ρT′,F:Zd×Y→Rdbe the cocycle of the action π◦ι◦T◦ι−1◦π−1; in other words
(6) T′
n(y)=(π◦ι◦Tn◦ι−1◦π−1)(y)=y+Fρ′(n,y) for all n∈Zdand y∈Y.
Ify=(π◦ι)(z) for z∈Z, then Eq. (6) translates into
π(Tnz,0)=π(z,ρ′(n,y)).
Since π(Tnz,0)=π(z,ρ(−n,Tnz))=π(z,−ρ(n,z)), we conclude that ρ′(n,y)=−ρ(n,z),
where y=(π◦ι)(z). In particular, Yis a discrete cross-section for the ﬂow Fprecisely
because ρescapes to inﬁnity.
Conversely, if Fis any free Rd-ﬂow on a standard Borel space X, and Z⊆Xis a dis-
crete cross-section with a Zd-action Ton it, then Fis isomorphic to the special ﬂow
over Tgenerated by the (necessarily injective) cocycle −ρT,F.KATOK’S SPECIAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR MULTIDIMENSIO NAL BOREL FLOWS 15
Let us say that a cocycle ρisadmissible if it is both injective and escapes to inﬁnity.
The discussion of the above two paragraphs can be summarized by saying that, up to
a change of sign in the cocycles, representing a ﬂow as a speci al ﬂow generated by an
admissible cocycle is the same thing as ﬁnding a free Zd-action on a discrete cross-
section of the ﬂow.
For instance, given any free Zd-action TonZ, we may consider the admissible cocy-
cleρ(n,z)=−nfor all z∈Zand n∈Zd. The set Y=π(Z×{0}) is then an integer grid for
the ﬂowF(in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.11). Conversely, any ﬂow that ad mits an integer
grid is isomorphic to a special ﬂow generated by such a cocycl e.
4.5. Special representation theorem. Restriction of the orbit equivalence relation of
anyRd-ﬂow onto a cross-section gives a hyperﬁnite equivalence re lation [10, Theo-
rem 1.16], and therefore can be realized as an orbit equivale nce relation by a free Borel
Zd-action (as long as the restricted equivalence relation is a periodic). Since any free
ﬂow admits a discrete (in fact, lacunary) aperiodic cross-s ection, it is isomorphic to a
special ﬂow over some action generated by some cocycle. In general, however, the struc-
ture of the Zd-orbit and the corresponding orbit of the ﬂow have little to d o with each
other. Theorem 3.12 and Corollary 3.13 allow us to improve on this and ﬁnd a special
representation generated by a bi-Lipschitz cocycle.
For comparison, Katok’s theorem [12] can be formulated in th e parlance of this sec-
tion as follows.
Theorem (Katok) .Pick some α>1. Any free ergodic measure-preserving Rd-ﬂow on
a standard Lebesgue space is isomorphic to a special ﬂow over a free ergodic measure-
preserving Zd-action generated by an (α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz cocycle.
As is the case with all ergodic theoretical results, isomorp hism is understood to hold
up to a set of measure zero. We may now conclude with a Borel ver sion of Katok’s special
representation theorem, which holds for all free Borel Rd-ﬂows and establishes isomor-
phism on all orbits.
Theorem 4.3. Pick some α>1. Any free Borel Rd-ﬂow is isomorphic to a special ﬂow over
a free Borel Zd-action generated by an (α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz cocycle.
Proof. LetFbe a free Borel Rd-ﬂow on X. Corollary 3.13 gives a cross-section Z⊆X
and aZd-action Ton it such that the cocycle ρF,T:Zd×X→Rdis (α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz.
By the discussion in Section 4.4, this gives a representatio n of the ﬂow as a special ﬂow
over Tgenerated by the cocycle −ρF,T, which is also ( α−1,α)-bi-Lipschitz. /square
