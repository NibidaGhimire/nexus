Abstract. The TIFR Near Infrared Imaging Camera-II (TIRCAM2) is being used at the 3.6 m Devasthal Op-
tical Telescope (DOT) operated by Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital,
Uttarakhand, India. Earlier, the TIRCAM2 was used at the main port of the DOT on time shared basis. It has
now been installed at the side port of the telescope. Side port installation allows near simultaneous observations
with the main port instrument as well as longer operating periods. Thus, the TIRCAM2 serves the astronomical
community for a variety of observations ranging from lunar occultations, transient events and normal scheduled
observations.
Keywords. Optical telescope, near-infrared camera, side port, infrared observation
1. Introduction
The 3.6 meter Devasthal Optical Telescope (DOT) has
been built by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Ob-
servational Sciences (ARIES) in collaboration with the
Belgian ﬁrm, Advanced Mechanical and Optical Sys-
tem (AMOS, see Figure 1 (left), Sagar et al ., 2019).
The DOT is located at the Devasthal observatory site
near Nainital (Uttarakhand district) at an altitude of
2450 m above mean sea level. The DOT is currently
the largest single mirror telescope in India. The oper-
ational wavebands of the DOT run from 0.35 m to 5
m. Some of the speciﬁcations of the DOT are given in
Figure 2.
2. TIRCAM2 - an NIR imaging camera at DOT
The TIRCAM2 has imaging capability from 1 m to
3.7m (Naik et al., 2012; Baug et al., 2018). Figure
1 (right) shows the TIRCAM2 instrument. The cam-
era has an InSb focal plane array with 512 x 512 pix-
els. It operates at a temperature of 35 K, cooled by
a closed cycle Helium cryo-cooler. Many successful
science observations have been done with this camera
from the main (axial) port of the DOT. For example,
Baug et al . (2018) describe imaging capabilities andresults of TIRCAM2 in J, H, K and narrow-band L
(nbL) bands. Anand et al. (2020) present imaging ca-
pabilities in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and nbL
bands. (Richichi et al ., 2020) present milliarcsecond
resolution results on cool giants and binary stars from
lunar occultations at Devashtal. Sharma et al. (2020)
describe a detailed analysis of the Cz3 open cluster us-
ing deep NIR observations taken from TIRCAM2. Af-
ter commissioning of the TIFR-ARIES Near Infrared
Spectrometer (TANSPEC), an NIR imager and spec-
trometer at DOT, it was decided to shift the TIRCAM2
camera to the side port of the DOT, thus becoming the
ﬁrst instrument at the side port of the DOT. This re-
quired designing a new mechanical structure to inter-
face the TIRCAM2 considering many technical aspects
such as optical alignments, mechanical envelop, TIR-
CAM2’s requirements of cryogenic cooling setup, etc.
3. Instrument Envelop for the side port
The DOT provides three cassegrain ports for mounting
the instruments, one is the main axial port and other two
are the side ports. Figures 3 and 4 show the envelops
for designing and developing instruments for the main
axial port and the side ports of the DOT. Figure 3 shows
the front view of the main axial port and both side ports

and Figure 4 shows the top view of the side port in-
strument envelops for DOT. TIRCAM2 main port en-
velop was 1020 mm (H) 612 mm (W)712 mm (L)
whereas TIRCAM2 side port envelop is 862 mm (H) 
360 mm (W)800 mm (L). The side port instruments
can have a weight of 250 kg each, with a center of grav-
ity at a position of 620 mm away from the instrument
interface plate. The focal plane is available at 100 mm
from the interface plate and 620 mm from the fold mir-
ror. Actual photograph of one of the side ports with and
without dummy cover is shown in Figure 5.
4. Mechanical structure design
Figure 6 shows the Zemax raytrace of the DOT tele-
scope with TIRCAM2 on the side port of DOT. Naik
et al. (2012) have presented a detailed schematic and
Zemax raytrace of TIRCAM2 optics. The telescope
side port focal plane is 100 mm away from the instru-
ment interface plate of the side port and 620 mm away
from the fold mirror (see Figure 3). The TIRCAM2
window is at a distance of 587 mm and 67 mm from the
fold mirror and the interface plate, respectively. The
aperture plane of the TIRCAM2 is 33 mm behind the

Considering the envelop size, mass and focal plane
of the side port, the instrument interface plate and rack
for mounting the TIRCAM2 were designed as shown in
Figures 7, 8 and 9. All camera equipments were suit-
ably mounted within the rack.

the interface plate and rack for the TIRCAM2 mounted on
the side port of the DOT Telescope.Figure 10 shows instrument base plate (left) and
rack (right), with the TIRCAM2 mounted on the side
port and Figure 11 shows the actual photographs of the
complete rack assembly with dummy lead bricks for
main port (left) and side port (right). Figure 12 shows
the complete rack assembly with its mounting on the
side port of the DOT. The total weight of the whole as-
sembly is around 248 kg as required for the side port in
order to balance the telescope. This 248 kg assembly is
lifted by the overhead crane during the mounting on the
side port (see Figure 13). UPS supply cables and Eth-
ernet cables are passed through the cable anti-twister in
the pier of the telescope. Figure 14 shows the evacua-
tion set up of the TIRCAM2 camera after mounting the
camera on the side port.
5. Performance at the side port
During the ﬁrst light of the TIRCAM2 at the side port,
the M53 globular cluster was observed on May 05,
2020. The M53 J-band image was taken at 5 dithered
positions with one frame at each position. The im-
age was cleaned for sky-background by subtracting the
median of the dithered frames. Mosaic of the M53 is
formed by combining the dithered frames. A part of the
mosaic (ﬁeld of view (FoV) 1:4501:450) is shown in
Figure 15 (left) and is compared with the corresponding
FoV of the 2MASS image (see Figure 15; right). The
Palomar 2 globular cluster was observed during regu-
lar science observations on November 17, 2021. The
J-band image was taken at 5 dithered positions with 11
frames at each position. Image cleaning process was
similar to that of the M53 J-band image. A part of
the mosaic (FoV1:301:30) of the Palomar 2 taken
with the TIRCAM2 is shown in Figure 16 (left) and for
comparison, the 2MASS J-band image of the same re-
gion is also shown in Figure 16 (right). The Full width
at half maxiam (FWHM) of the marked sources in the
TIRCAM2 images of the M53 (Figure 15; left) and the
Palomer 2 (Figure 16; left) are 5.30 pixels ( 0:900) (see
Figure 17; left) and 3.53 pixels ( 0:600) (see Figure 17;
right) respectively.
6. Achievements at the side port
With a new optimized mechanical setup, the TIRCAM2
was installed on the sideport of the DOT and it has be-
come the ﬁrst light instrument on the DOT sideport. A
new design and fabrication of the ﬁlter mechanism and
ﬁlter controller were carried out for the sideport by re-
placing the older ﬁlter mechanism and controller. Fur-
ther tuning of the setup was done especially with the
He gas pipe routing within the telescope structure. The#### Page 4 of 1 J. Astrophys. Astr. (0000) 000: ####

TIRCAM2 sideport performance is comparable to the
main port performance. The TIRCAM2 is now regu-
larly used for astronomical observations as per sched-
uled proposals. The TIRCAM2 at the sideport is also
regularly used for lunar and planetary occultation ob-
servations.
7. Conclusion
Interfacing of the TIRCAM2 camera on the side port of
the DOT has been completed successfully as shown in

port (left) and side port (right) of the DOT.
