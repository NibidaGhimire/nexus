The matrix rank and its positive versions are
robust for small approximations, i.e. they do
not decrease under small perturbations. In con-
trast, the multipartite tensor rank can collapse
for arbitrarily small errors, i.e. there may be
a gap between rank and border rank, leading
to instabilities in the optimization over sets
with fixed tensor rank. Can multipartite pos-
itive ranks also collapse for small perturba-
tions? In this work, we prove that multipartite
positive and invariant tensor decompositions
exhibit gaps between rank and border rank,
including tensor rank purifications and cyclic
separable decompositions. We also prove a cor-
respondence between positive decompositions
and membership in certain sets of multipartite
probability distributions, and leverage the gaps
between rank and border rank to prove that
these correlation sets are not closed. It follows
that testing membership of probability distri-
butions arising from resources like translational
invariant Matrix Product States is impossible
in finite time. Overall, this work sheds light on
the instability of ranks and the unique behavior
of bipartite systems.
1 Introduction
It is well-known that low-rank approximations of ma-
trices are well-behaved: For every matrix, there is a
best low-rank approximation with a fixed error, and
every element closer to the original matrix must be of
larger rank. In other words, the approximate rank
rankε(T):= inf
W∈Bε(T)rank(W)
whereBε(T)is theε-ball around an element Tfor a
given norm∥·∥, coincides with the exact rank when
ε>0is small enough.
Surprisingly, the multipartite tensor rank behaves
very differently: There exist tensors Twhere the bor-
der rank
rank(T):= lim
ε→0rankε(T)

isstrictly smaller than the rank of T(see Figure 1).
For the mathematician, this means that the rank is
not lower semi-continuous. This is equivalent to the
statement that the set of tensors whose rank is upper
bounded by a constant r

is topologically not closed, since there are sequences
inTwhose limit is not in T. As a consequence, opti-
mization problems over such sets, such as computing
an optimal low-rank approximation, are generally ill-
posed [6]. It is known that tensor decompositions with
three or more local spaces exhibit a gap between rank
and border rank [1, 7, 8], and so do tensor network
decompositions containing loops [5, 4, 3, 9], where
some of these results concern symmetric decomposi-
tions of invariant tensors. We refer to [10] for an
elaborate treatment of the topological properties of
tensor ranks. For a perspective on optimization prob-
lems over fixed-rank tensors via the condition number,
we refer to [11].
What about positive multipartite tensors? Positive
semidefinite and nonnegative tensors represent quan-
tum and classical notions of positivity, respectively,
and are thus central in quantum information theory
and classical probability theory. Yet, the tensor de-
compositions mentioned above are insufficient to rep-
resent positive elements, as it is generally impossi-
ble to guarantee the global positivity [12, 13]. This
can be circumvented by introducing locally positive

constraints, as in the local purification form and the
separable decomposition for mixed states [14, 15, 16],
or the nonnegative, positive semidefinite and square-
root decomposition for entrywise nonnegative tensors
[17, 18, 15, 16, 19]. Each of these gives rise to a notion
of positive rank, which characterizes the complexity
of linear vs. semidefinite programs [20, 21] or classi-
cal vs. quantum correlation complexities [18, 22, 23].
Can multipartite positive tensor ranks, possibly with
invariance, exhibit a gap with its border rank?
In this work, we prove that several locally positive
and invariant decompositions exhibit a gap between
rank and border rank, as summarized in Figure 2.
This includes positive and/or symmetric versions of
Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product
Operators (MPO). We also prove that the ranks of
these decompositions determine whether a probabil-
ity distribution can be generated by certain classes of
states via local measurements; for example, we prove
that the positive semidefinite rank of a nonnegative
tensor captures the amount of entanglement needed
to generate multipartite probability distributions by
local measurements (see Figure 3). We then leverage
the gaps to border ranks together with this connection
to quantum correlations to show that:
(i) If a tensor network has a loop, computing the
best approximation with fixed positive rank is
ill-posed. Specifically, given a mixed state ρ(of
rank larger than r), there is generally no mixed
stateσwhich is the best approximation among all
decompositions with a positive rank bounded by
r, because for any ε>0there is anε-close mixed
state of rank r, while the rank of ρis strictlylarger than r.
(ii) The set of probability distributions generated
by a multipartite state with local measurements
(Figure 3 (a)) is not closed. Thus, it is impossible
to verify the necessity of a certain resource state
from sampling the distribution, even in arbitrar-
ily many rounds. The same applies to generat-
ing multipartite mixed states from local quantum
channels (Figure 3 (b)).
(iii) We provide correlation scenarios where the quan-
tum case is fragile with respect to approxima-
tions, while the classical case is robust. This
shows a novel type of separation between these
two scenarios.
This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we
review positive tensor decompositions on nonnegative
tensors and positive semidefinite multipartite matri-
ces. In Section 3, we present the results summarized
in Figure 2. In Section 4, we provide applications of
positive tensor decompositions and implications of the
existence of border ranks. In Section 5, we conclude
and discuss open questions.
The appendix is structured as follows. In Ap-
pendix A, we review positive and invariant tensor
decompositions on hypergraph structures, so-called
(Ω,G)-decompositions. In Appendix B, Appendix E,
Appendix F, and Appendix G, we present proofs of
lemmas used in the main text. In Appendix C and
Appendix D, we review basic facts of the topology of
quantum channels and positive operator-valued mea-
sures.

The translational invariant (t.i.) cyclic psd-rank characterizes

a nonnegative tensor representing an n-partite probability
distribution. The gap between rank and border rank implies
that the set of probability distributions generated in such a
way is not closed. The same applies when replacing the cyclic
graph and translational invariance by other decomposition ge-
ometries and symmetries (see Theorem 6). (b) Gaps between
border rank and rank also imply that the set of n-partite
density matrices arising via MPS of bond dimension rand
local quantum channels is not closed.
2 Positive tensor decompositions
In the following we review several tensor decompo-
sition on entrywise nonnegative tensors by varying
them in three different aspects: local positivity (Sec-
tion 2.1), arrangement of indices (Section 2.2), and
symmetry (Section 2.3). A summary of all the differ-
ent notions of ranks together with their abbreviations
is provided in Figure 4. We will later generalize these
decompositions to multipartite positive semidefinite
(psd) matrices (Section 2.4). Finally, we introduce in
Section 2.5 the notion of a border rank.
Bipartite locally positive tensor decompositions
arise from matrix factorizations. For instance, given
a matrixT∈Md(C)∼=Cd⊗Cd,Thas rank at most
rif there exists a decomposition
T=r/summationdisplay
α=1|vα⟩⟨¯wα|, (1)
where⟨¯wα|:=|wα⟩t. Equivalently, seeing Tas an
element in Cd⊗Cd, the matrix factorization translates
into
T=r/summationdisplay
α=1|vα⟩⊗|wα⟩.
Restricting to entrywise nonnegative vectors, i.e.
⟨j|vα⟩,⟨j|wα⟩≥0for everyj∈{1,...,d}, we ob-
tain the nonnegative matrix factorization [24]. We de-
note the minimal rattained by such a decomposition
asnn-rank (T). Replacing the nonnegative vectors bypsd matrices, we obtain the psd matrix factorization,
given by
Tij=r/summationdisplay
α,β=1(Ai)α,β·(Bj)α,β= tr/parenleftbig
AiBt
j/parenrightbig
whereAi,Bj∈M+
r(C)are hermitian psd matrices of
sizer×r. The positive semidefinite rank psd-rank (T)
is the minimum size r∈Nnecessary to generate such
a decomposition.
These three ranks are related via the inequalities
(see [17])
rank(T)≤psd-rank(T)2(2)
and
psd-rank(T),rank(T)≤nn-rank(T). (3)
Note that inequalities in the other direction do not
exist in general without including the dimension d.
2.1 Multipartite tensor decompositions
Bipartite decompositions generalize to multipartite
ones by considering more vectors and keeping the sum
over a single index, i.e.
T=r/summationdisplay
α=1|vα⟩⊗|wα⟩⊗···⊗|zα⟩.
With the additional constraint of entrywise nonneg-
ative local vectors we obtain the standard nonneg-
ative multipartite tensor decomposition. The psd-
decomposition generalizes to the multipartite case as
Tj1,...,jn=r/summationdisplay
α,β=1(Aj1)α,β·(Bj2)α,β···(Zjn)α,β,(4)
whereAj,Bj,...,Zj∈M+
r(C)are psd [23, 16].
By introducing multiple summation indices, we ob-
tain various decompositions of multipartite tensors
into local elements. For example, a cyclic decomposi-
tion is given by
T=r/summationdisplay
α1,...,αn=1|xα1,α2⟩⊗|yα2,α3⟩⊗···⊗|zαn,α1⟩,(5)
This is known as a Matrix Product State (MPS) de-
composition [25]. Restricting again to nonnegative
tensors gives rise to the nonnegative cyclic decompo-
sitions [16, 19], also called Stochastic Matrix Product
State [26]. Similarly,
Tj1,...,jn=r/summationdisplay
αi,βi=1(Aj1)α1,α2;β1,β2···(Zjn)αn,α1;βn,β1,
(6)
whereAi,...,Zi∈M+
r2(C)are psd, defines the cyclic
psd-decomposition [15, 19].
Analogously to the bipartite case, these notions of
ranks are related via the inequalities in Equations (2)
and(3).

2.2 Arbitrary arrangements of indices
More generally, one can define any arrangement of in-
dices with a hypergraph Ωby associating the nodes
to the local spaces and the (hyper-)edges to the sum-
mation indices. This includes all so far mentioned
decompositions (see Figure 5 for examples). Given
a hypergraph Ω, we define the corresponding ranks
asrank Ω,nn-rank Ω,psd-rankΩ[16]. One particular
subclass of decompositions considered in this paper
arises from trees (i.e. connected graphs containing no
loops). Note that the notion of a tree has no meaning
for hypergraphs. While tree tensor decompositions do
not show a gap between border rank and rank, some
positive tensor decompositions exhibit a gap already
for the simplest hypergraph, namely a simplex. For
a detailed treatment of Ω-decompositions we refer to
Appendix A, where Ω-decompositions are defined via
weighted simplicial complexes Ωrepresenting the hy-
pergraph structure.
2.3 Symmetric decompositions
Many tensor decompositions admit a symmetrized
version, where we define a symmetric decomposition
by constraining the local elements to being the same.
For example, the symmetric tensor decomposition is
given by
T=r/summationdisplay
α=1|vα⟩⊗|vα⟩⊗···⊗|vα⟩.
A psd-decomposition as given in Equation (4)is called
symmetric if all local matrices Aj,Bj,...are identi-
cal for every fixed j. In this situation, we denote
the corresponding ranks by symm-rank for the un-
constrained, symm-psd-rank for the positive semidef-
inite, and symm-nn-rank for the nonnegative decom-
position.
For a cyclic decomposition, its translational invari-
ant (t.i.) version is given by

structures Ωgive rise to different tensor decompositions. Each
vertex corresponds to a local space and each (hyper-)edge
corresponds to an index in the decomposition. If Ωis the
n-simplex, we obtain standard tensor decomposition (a), for
then-cycle, we obtain the cyclic decomposition (b), for a line
of lengthnwe get the decomposition in (c) and for a tree,
we obtain a tree tensor network (d).

Fig. 6: A group action on a hypergraph Ωis a group action on
the vertices (red), that induces a well-defined group action on
the edges (green). The group action gives rise to constraints
on the local tensors. In this example the group action gives
rise to the constraint |v[i]
α,β⟩=|v[j]
α,β⟩fori,j∈{1,...,n}
(blue).
Similarly, a t.i. psd-decomposition is given by a de-
composition as in Equation (6)where all local ma-
tricesAj,Bj,...are identical for every fixed j. We
denote the corresponding ranks by ti-osr ,ti-psd-osr ,
andti-nn-osr .
Symmetric decompositions generalize to arbitrary
structures Ωby introducing a group action Gon the
set of vertices{1,...,n}that is compatible with the
hypergraph structure (see Figure 6 for an example).
This gives rise to (Ω,G)-decompositions, each with
its corresponding rank. We refer to Appendix A for
further details.
2.4 Positive and invariant decompositions of
multipartite psd matrices
There is a similar hierarchy of tensor decompositions
for psd matrices ρ∈Md(C)⊗ncontaining the uncon-
strained tensor decomposition1
ρ=r/summationdisplay
α=1Aα⊗Bα⊗···⊗Cα (8)
whereAα,Bα,Cα∈Md(C), the separable decompo-
sition, where Aα,Bα,Cαare restricted to being psd
matrices, and the local purification form, which con-
sists of a factorization ρ=LL†together with an un-
constrained tensor decomposition of L. We denote
the corresponding ranks by rank(ρ),sep-rank (ρ), and
puri-rank (ρ). In the unconstrained case and the sep-
arable case, rank(ρ)andsep-rank (ρ)are the minimal
r∈Nsuch that a decomposition of the form (8)ex-
ists. The purification rank puri-rank (ρ)is the mini-
malrank(L)among all purifications of ρ. One can
define arbitrary Ω-decompositions by arranging the
indices of the local matrices differently. We refer to
Appendix A for details.
The hierarchy of positive tensor decompositions em-
beds in the framework of types of matrix tensor de-
compositions as follows. Choosing
ρT:=d/summationdisplay
j1,...,jn=1Tj1,...,jn|j1,...,jn⟩⟨j1,...,jn|,(9)
1An unconstrained tensor decomposition refers to the fact
that the decomposition contains no positivity constraints in its
local terms.every unconstrained tensor decomposition of ρTcan
be made into an unconstrained tensor decomposition
ofTby ignoring the off-diagonal terms. The same is
true for the separable and nonnegative decomposition
as well as the positive semidefinite decomposition and
the purification form. In particular, we have that
rank(T) = rank(ρT),
nn-rank(T) = sep-rank( ρT),
psd-rank(T) = puri-rank( ρT).
including all different arrangements of indices as well
as symmetries. For a detailed exposition and a proof
of the correspondence we refer to [15, Theorem 38]
and [16, Theorem 43].
If a certain type of rank for nonnegative tensors
exhibits a gap between border rank and rank, then
this gap is also present for the corresponding matrix
tensor rank. For example, for any tensor Twith
psd-rank (T)<psd-rank(T)we have that
puri-rank (ρT)≤psd-rank (T)
<psd-rank(T)
= puri-rank( ρT)
where we have used the correspondence above in the
first and the last step.
2.5 Border ranks
The rank of a tensor relates to complexity measures in
various descriptions [2, 27, 23]. Are these complexities
robust to approximations? In other words, given an
approximation error ε>0, how does the smallest rank
of an approximation
rankε(T):= inf
∥M−T∥<εrank(M)
relate to its exact counterpart rank(T)? For a fixed
approximation error, Ref. [28] shows that for certain
ℓp-norms and Schatten p-norms, the ranks of the corre-
sponding decompositions nn-rankεandsep-rankεcan
be upper bounded independently of the system dimen-
sion, in contrast to their exact counterparts. However,
these bounds depend on εand therefore diverge if
ε→0.
The border rank [2, 1, 8] is an asymptotic measure
for the approximate rank2, i.e.
rank(T) = lim
ε→0rankε(T).
That is, rank(T)≤rif and only if there exists a
converging sequence of tensors Tn→Tsuch that
rank(Tn)≤r. By definition, we have
rankε(T)≤rank(T)≤rank(T)
2Note that the function ε∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→rankε(T) is constant for εsmall
enough.
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 5for every fixed approximation error ε>0. Note that
the border rank is independent of the choice of the
norms for convergence since all norms are equivalent
in finite dimensional vector spaces.3. Therefore, if
Tn→Tconverges, it also converges in any other
norm. Moreover, the border rank is independent of
normalization. If rank(T) =r, then we also have
rank(T/∥T∥) =rfor any norm.
The border rank of all other notions of ranks pre-
sented in this section is defined similarly. We denote
them by placing an underline on the usual identifier
of the corresponding rank.
It is known that in the case of the matrix rank (i.e.
the bipartite tensor rank), we have that
rank(T) = rank(T)
for every bipartite tensor T. This follows from the fact
that the rank corresponds to the size of the largest sub-
matrix ofTwith non-zero determinant and that the
determinant is continuous. Alternatively, the state-
ment follows from the Eckart–Young approximation
theorem [29].
However, for multipartite tensor decompositions,
there are tensors Tsuch that
rank(T)<rank(T).
Whenever such a situation appears, we will say that
there is a gap between rank and border rank . More-
over, if there exists a sequence of multipartite tensors
(Tn)n∈NwithTn∈(Cd)⊗nsuch that rank(Tn)is con-
stant and rank(Tn)→∞ , we will say that there is a
border rank separation .
Results on the existence and non-existence of
gaps between border ranks and ranks include uncon-
strained tensor decompositions with various arrange-
ment of indices [2, 4, 3], bipartite locally positive de-
compositions [17], and the standard nonnegative ten-
sor decomposition [30]. For completeness, we give a
brief overview of these results in the next section.
3 Gaps between rank and border rank
Here we present the results summarized in Figure 2.
Throughout, gaps between ranks and border ranks
are established by giving explicit examples of tensors
exhibiting them.
3.1 Standard tensor decompositions
Since the matrix rank does not exhibit a gap between
border rank and rank, systems of size n= 3are the
smallest examples with a gap between border rank
and rank. While this has been studied for the stan-
dard and symmetric tensor rank, we extend this in-
vestigations in this subsection also to positive tensor
3That is, there exist constants A,B> 0, such that A∥·∥1≤
∥·∥2≤B∥·∥1decompositions for nonnegative tensors and positive
semidefinite matrices.
For the standard (unconstrained) tensor decompo-
sition, the unnormalized n-partiteW-state
Wn:=|0,..., 0,1⟩+|0,..., 1,0⟩+...+|1,0,..., 0⟩
exhibits a gap between border rank and rank as well as
between symmetric border rank and rank for system
sizesn≥3. Specifically, for ε > 0, the family of
tensors
Wε
n=1
ε(|0⟩+ε|1⟩)⊗n−1
ε|0,..., 0⟩ (10)
imply that
symm-rank (Wn) = rank (Wn) = 2
since limε→0Wε
n=Wn. On the other hand,
rank(Wn) =n(see Proposition 18 in Appendix B for
a self-contained proof).4
We now show that the Wn-tensor exhibits a gap
between rank and border rank for the psd-rank. For
this purpose, we first present a lower bound of the
psd-rank using the following lemma and then compute
an upper bound of the border rank.
Lemma 1. LetTbe a nonnegative tensor. Then,
rank(T)≤psd-rank(T)2
The same bound holds for arbitrary arrangements of
indices Ωwith arbitrary symmetry-constraints.
We refer to Lemma 20 in Appendix B for a proof.
Lemma 1 implies that psd-rank (W5)≥3as well as
psd-rank (Wn) = Ω(√n).5It is not known if this lower
bound is tight.

for a suitable constant C∈Rprovides an arbitrarily
close approximation of Wnwhich proves that
psd-rank (Wn) = symm-psd-rank (Wn) = 2.
In other words, there is a border rank separation for
n-partite psd-decompositions with n≥5.
In the 3-partite case, a dimension analysis shows
that symm-psd-rank (W3)≥3, thereby also leading
to a gap between border rank and rank (see Propo-
sition 21 in the appendix). However, for the non-
symmetric case in the tripartite scenario the existence
4Alternatively, this statement can be shown for the symmetric
rank by using Sylvester’s theorem for binary forms [ 31,32]. The
statement for the standard tensor rank follows by the validity
of Comon’s conjecture for tensors with border rank 2 [33].

Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 6of a gap between border rank and rank is still open
(see Conjecture 2 and Section 5).
In contrast to the psd-decomposition, the nonneg-
ative (and subsequently also the separable) decompo-
sition exhibit no gap between border rank and rank
in then-partite case for arbitrary n, as we will see in
Section 3.5. The special case of nonnegative decom-
positions has already been shown in [34].
3.2 Border ranks for cyclic decompositions
We now consider the cyclic decomposition with and
without translational invariance. Barthel et al. [3]
show that for the operator Schmidt rank, there is a
gap between border rank and rank for the two-domain
state, given by
τ:=k/summationdisplay
α=1|α,α⟩⊗n
+n−2/summationdisplay
i=0k/summationdisplay
α̸=β=1|α,α⟩⊗i⊗|α,β⟩⊗|β,β⟩⊗(n−i−2)⊗|β,α⟩.
In particular, they prove that osr(τ)≤k<osr(τ).
The construction in [3] also leads to a gap between
border rank and rank for nonnegative cyclic decompo-
sitions, which we briefly review now. Let ε >0and
define, for every α,β∈{1,...,k}, the nonnegative
vectors
|vε
α,β⟩=ε|α,β⟩+ (1−ε)δα,β|α,β⟩
whereδα,βis the Kronecker-delta, as well as
|wε
α,β⟩=δα,β|α,β⟩+1
ε(1−δα,β)|α,β⟩.
Setting
τε=k/summationdisplay
αi=1|vε
α1,α2⟩⊗|vε
α2,α3⟩⊗···⊗|vε
αn−1,αn⟩⊗|wε
αn,α1⟩
we obtainτε=τ+O(ε)and therefore nn-osr (τ)≤k.
This implies the following chain of inequalities
osr(τ)≤nn-osr (τ)≤k<osr(τ)≤nn-osr(τ)
where the strict inequality is shown in [3, Proposition
5] and the inequalities between osrandnn-osr hold
because the latter is a constrained version of the for-
mer.
While Lemma 1 cannot be employed to prove a gap
between border psd-rank and psd-rank since the gap
between border rank and rank is too small, we will
see that a gap also appears for t.i. psd-decompositions.
For this reason, we expect the same behavior for the
non-symmetric case.
Conjecture 2. There is a nonnegative tensor Tsuch
thatpsd-osr (T)<psd-osr(T).3.3 Translational invariant cyclic decomposi-
tion
We now prove the existence of gaps between border
rank and rank for cyclic t.i. decompositions. We ob-
tain border rank separations for all types of decompo-
sitions.
First, for the unconstrained tensor decomposition,
the rank of the t.i. decomposition of Wnincreases
with system size, while osr(Wn) = 2 [15, Example
22]. There are several lower bounds regarding the

inequality [35], the tightest lower bound [15, Proposi-
tion 23] is given to the best of our knowledge by
ti-osr(Wn)≥√n (12)
using the irreducible form of MPS [36]. On the other
hand, Christandl et al. [4] show that ti-osr (Wn) =

border rank and rank for the t.i. cyclic decompositions

For the t.i. psd-decomposition, we obtain

Using Lemma 1 together with Equation (12) we have
that

and in particular ti-psd-osr (Wn)≥3as soon asn≥

and rank for the t.i. cyclic psd-decomposition.
For the t.i. nonnegative decomposition we construct
a tensor with a separation between border rank and
rank for every odd n≥5. Consider again the tensor
Wn. By the previous discussion we have
ti-nn-osr(Wn)≥ti-osr(Wn)≥√n.
We will now show that
ti-nn-osr (Wn)≤2
ifnis odd. To this end, we use in the following the

3.4 Decomposing multipartite psd matrices
The three types of positive decompositions for non-
negative tensors are related to the three positive de-
compositions for multipartite psd matrices (see Sec-
tion 2.4). This enables us to translate gaps between
border ranks and ranks for positive tensor decomposi-
tions to gaps between border rank and rank for mul-
tipartite psd matrices. Given a tensor T, such that
psd-rank (T)<psd-rank (T), the matrix ρT(Equation
(9)) satisfies
puri-rank (ρT)≤psd-rank (T)
<psd-rank(T)
= puri-rank( ρT).
and thereby exhibits a gap between border rank and
rank for puri-rank . Analogously, one obtains gaps
for matrix tensor decompositions whenever there is a
gap in the corresponding tensor decomposition. This
strategy results in gaps between border rank and
rank for symm-puri-rank ,ti-puri-osr ,sep-osr , and
ti-sep-osr .3.5 Non-existence of border rank gaps
In the following, we provide two cases where no gaps
between border rank and rank appear. First, we es-
tablish that for standard tensor decompositions (i.e.
only containing one summation index), the nn-rank ,
symm-nn-rank ,sep-rank , and the symm-sep-rank
do not exhibit a gap. Second, we prove that Ω-
decompositions arising from a tree Ωdo not exhibit
gaps between rank and border rank regardless of the
positivity constraints.
The proof strategy is similar in both cases. We
first show that every decomposition can be reduced
to a particular normalized version (i.e. every local el-
ement satisfies a normalization constraint). Then, we
apply the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem to the local el-
ements to guarantee that every sequence of decompo-
sitions obtained from a converging sequence of global
elements converges to a decomposition of the same
rank.
Nonnegative and separable standard tensor decomposi-
tions
Let us now show that nn-rank ,symm-nn-rank ,
sep-rank , and the symm-sep-rank do not exhibit a
gap between rank and border rank.
Theorem 3. Let (ρk)k∈Nbe a sequence of n-
partite separable matrices with limit ρk→ρand
sep-rank(ρk)≤rfor everyk. Then,
sep-rank(ρ)≤r
The same statement holds for symm-sep-rank . It also
holds for sequences of nonnegative tensors together
with nn-rank , and symm-nn-rank .
Since the nonnegative decomposition corresponds
to the separable decomposition of a diagonal matrix,
it suffices to show the statement for separable decom-
positions. We will now give a sketch of the proof;
for details and the general statement, we refer to Ap-
pendix G. Without loss of generality, let ρkbe a se-
quence ofn-partite separable matrices with a separa-
ble decomposition
ρk=r/summationdisplay
α=1ρ[1]
α,k⊗ρ[2]
α,k⊗···⊗ρ[n]
α,k.
This sequence can be chosen to be normalized, i.e.
∥ρ[i]
α,k∥≤C∥ρ∥, so that (ρ[i]
α,k)k∈Nis a bounded se-
quence. The Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem (Theo-
rem 22 in the appendix) implies the existence of a
limiting point of a subsequence leading to a separable
decomposition of ρwith sep-rank(ρ)≤r.
This generalizes the result in [30], which shows that
the multipartite nonnegative standard tensor decom-
position does not exhibit a gap between rank and bor-
der rank.

Fig. 7: Proof idea of Lemma 5 . Assuming that the separable
matrixρattains a normalized decomposition on subtrees of
size at most n−1(i.e. every local family of matrices is
normalized except one), we obtain a normalized decomposition
of sizenby shifting the weight to the added vertex.
Tree tensor network decompositions
Tensor networks without local positivity show border
rank phenomena if and only if they contain loops in
the hypergraph Ωthat specifies the decomposition
structure [3]. In particular, if a hypergraph Ωis a
tree, the corresponding unconstrained tensor network
decomposition exhibits no gap between rank and bor-
der rank (see also Appendix H for a brief review of this
result). In the following we will prove that the same
is the case for positive tensor networks. We show the
following:
Theorem 4. LetΩbe a tree and Ta nonnegative
tensor,ρ1ann-partite separable matrix and ρ2an
n-partite psd matrix. Then, the following holds:
(i)nn-rankΩ(T) = nn-rank Ω(T)
(ii)psd-rankΩ(T) = psd-rankΩ(T)
(iii) sep-rankΩ(ρ1) = sep-rankΩ(ρ1)
(iv) puri-rankΩ(ρ2) = puri-rankΩ(ρ2)
For the proof of (i) and (iii) we refer to Ap-
pendix H.2, for the proof of (ii) and (iv) we refer to
Appendix H.3.
Again, the proof contains the same two steps: First,
every element attains a decomposition with bounded
local elements; second, every bounded sequence con-
tains a limiting sequence which gives rise to an opti-
mal decomposition. In the following, we will give a
brief sketch of the proof for the separable decompo-
sition. The existence of a normalized decomposition
follows from the following lemma.
Lemma 5. LetΩbe a tree and ρann-partite separable
matrix with sep-rankΩ(ρ)≤rand bounded trace-norm
∥ρ∥1≤1. There exists a separable decomposition of
rankrsuch that the trace-norm of each local matrix is
bounded by 1.We refer to Appendix H.2 for the proof of Lemma 5.
Following the same reasoning as for the separable stan-
dard tensor decomposition, Lemma 5 together with
the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem implies that for ev-
ery sequence ρk→ρwith sep-rank (ρk)≤rfor every
kit follows that sep-rank (ρ)≤rwhich proves (iii) in
Theorem 4.
Note that Lemma 5 implies that every separable
density matrix attains an optimal decomposition
ρ=r/summationdisplay
α1,...,αn=1ρ[1]
α1⊗ρ[2]
α1,α2⊗···⊗ρ[n−1]
αn−2,αn−1⊗ρ[n]
αn−1
with∥ρ[i]
α,β∥1≤1, since the summation indices are
arranged according to a line. In contrast, a cyclic
decomposition is in general not normalizable since this
violates the gap between rank and border rank for
separable decompositions shown in Section 3.2 and
Section 3.4.
We now present the proof idea of Lemma 5. Every
tree can be built up from smaller ones, and, by in-
duction over such decompositions, the weight of local
elements can be transferred to neighboring vertices
in the larger tree (see Figure 12). For a single sys-
tem, the statement is trivial. For n−1→nconsider
the graph which arises when removing the vertex n.
The tree factorizes into smaller trees of size at most
n−1. By the induction hypothesis, we can assume
that every subtree leads to a family of normalized de-
compositions where each local vector is normalized by
1, except for the local vectors in the systems adjacent
tonwhich are normalized by ∥ρ∥1. We finally show
that it attains a decomposition with local matrices
normalized by 1for systems 1,...,n−1and normal-
ized by∥ρ∥1≤1for system nby adding system n
and transferring the weights to system n.
4 Consequences
Let us now present two implications of the existence
of gaps between rank and border rank in multipar-
tite positive tensor decompositions. In Section 4.1 we
show a correspondence between positive tensor decom-
positions and quantum correlation sets. The gaps be-
tween border ranks and ranks then imply that certain
sets of quantum correlations are not closed. In Sec-
tion 4.2 we prove that gaps also lead to new types of
separations between positive tensor ranks.
4.1 Sets of quantum correlations are not closed
Positive tensor decompositions give rise to statements
about (quantum) correlations. Consider a bipartite
finite probability distribution represented as an entry-
wise nonnegative tensor P∈Cd⊗Cdvia
Pij=P(X=i,Y=j)

(a) For a nonnegative tensor Prepresenting an n-partite prob-
ability distribution, the standard nonnegative rank character-
izes the range of a shared hidden variable to generate Pvia
local conditional probability distributions. (b) psd-rankΩ(P)
characterizes the minimal rank Ωof a resource state |ψ⟩to
generatePvia local measurements. (c) For an n-partite
density matrix ρ,puri-rankΩ(ρ)characterizes the minimal
rank Ωof a resource state |ψ⟩to generateρvia local quantum
channels.
whereXandYare random values taking values in
{1,...,d}. It is known that the non-negative rank of
Pcorresponds to the minimal range of a hidden vari-
able Λnecessary to sample this distribution locally.
Similarly, the psd-rank (P)is the minimal Schmidt
rank of the bipartite state |ψ⟩necessary to generate
Pvia local measurements on each qudit [17, 18].
We now show that these correspondences generalize
to multipartite tensor decompositions as well as multi-
partite matrix tensor decompositions. Together with
the existence of non-trivial border ranks, this entails
that these sets of probability distributions as well as
density matrices are topologically not closed.Entanglement in correlation scenarios and positive ranks
We define the set CCorr (n,d,r )as the set of probabil-
ity distributions arising from local distributions con-
ditioned on a shared hidden variable taking values in
{1,...,r}(see Figure 8 (a)), i.e.
P(X1=j1,...,Xn=jn)
=r/summationdisplay
α=1P(Λ =α)n/productdisplay
i=1P(Xi=ji|Λ =α)
whereX1,...,Xnare random variables taking values
in{1,...,d}.
Similarly, we define the set CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )for
a given hypergraph Ωand a group action GonΩas
the set of all probability distributions Parising as
P(X1=j1,...,Xn=jn) =⟨ψ|A[1]
j1⊗···⊗A[n]
jn|ψ⟩
where/parenleftig
A[i]
j/parenrightigd
j=1fori∈{1,...,n}are POVM mea-
surements that are G-symmetric, i.e. the measure-
ment on position icoincides with the measurement
ongifor everyg∈G. In other words, we have that
A[gi]
j=A[i]
jfor everyg∈G. Moreover,|ψ⟩satisfies
the constraint that rank (Ω,G)(|ψ⟩)≤r(see Figure 8
(b)).
So, for example, when Ω = Θnis a cycle graph of
lengthn(i.e. vertexiis only connected to i−1andi+1
with addition modulo n+1) then CQCorr Θn(n,d,r )is
the set of all n-partite probability distributions ob-
tained from an MPS |ψ⟩with osr(|ψ⟩)≤rvia lo-
cal measurements on each local space. For the cyclic
groupG=Cn,CQCorr (Θn,Cn)(n,d,r )is the set of
probability distributions obtained from an MPS |ψ⟩
with ti-osr (|ψ⟩)≤rvia identical local measurements
on each local space.
These correlation scenarios also generalize to quan-
tum states instead of probability distributions by re-
placing local measurement operators by local quan-
tum channels (see Figure 8 (c)). We define the set
QQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )as the set of all density matrices
arising as
ρ= (E1⊗···⊗En)(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|)
where (Ei)n
i=1is aG-invariant family of quantum chan-
nels, i.e.Ei=Egi. Moreover,|ψ⟩satisfies the restric-
tion that rank (Ω,G)(|ψ⟩)≤r.
Analogous to the above example, if Ω = Θnis
a cycle graph of length n, then QQCorr Θn(n,d,r )
is the set of all n-partite density matrices obtained
from an MPS|ψ⟩with osr(|ψ⟩)≤rand applying
local quantum channels on each local space. The
setQQCorr (Θn,Cn)(n,d,r )are the density matrices ob-
tained from an MPS |ψ⟩with ti-osr (|ψ⟩)≤rand ap-
plying identical quantum channels on each local space.
Similarly to the bipartite case [23, 34], there is a cor-
respondence between the local purification form and
multipartite quantum scenarios.

⇔
psd-rank(Ω,G)(P)≤r
(iii)ρ∈QQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )
⇔
puri-rank(Ω,G)(ρ)≤r
For a proof of the statements in this theorem, we
refer to Theorem 25, Theorem 29 and Theorem 31,
respectively in Appendix E and Appendix F.
Non-closedness of quantum correlation scenarios
We now show that the correspondence in Theorem 6
together with the gaps between ranks and border
ranks imply that the sets of correlations are not closed.
It follows that it is generally impossible to test mem-
bership of a probability distribution in these sets with
a finite number of measurements.
To prove non-closedness, let (Pk)k∈Nbe a sequence
of tensors representing a probability distribution with
limk→∞Pk=Pand exhibiting a gap between rank
and border rank, i.e.
psd-rank(Ω,G)(Pk)≤r<psd-rank(Ω,G)(P).
ThenPk∈CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )for allk∈Nwhile
P /∈CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r ), i.e. CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )is
not closed.
This implies that there does not always exist a wit-
ness detecting the rank of a resource state necessary
to generate a probability distribution. We call a con-
tinuous function f:/parenleftbig
Rd/parenrightbig⊗n→Ra witness detecting
P /∈CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )if and only if f(P)<0and
f(Q)≥0for allQ∈CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r ). Assum-
ing such a function exists, a sequence exhibiting a
gap between border rank and rank would violate the
property that fis continuous. So, it is not possible to
detect the rank necessary to generate Pfrom finitely
many samples generating P, since every ε-ball around
Pintersects with CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r ).
According to the gaps between ranks and border
ranks (see Figure 2) the same behavior appears in the
following cases:
(i) Testing the standard tensor rank for n≥5.
(ii) Symmetrically testing the symmetric tensor rank
forn≥3.
(iii) Symmetrically testing the translational invariant
operator Schmidt rank for n≥17.Analogously, one can show that QQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )
is not closed in the above situations.
In contrast, the set of classical correlations
CCorr (n,d,r )is closed for every choice of n,d,r∈N.
This follows from the fact that nn-rank does not
exhibit a gap between border rank and rank, and
hence for every converging sequence of nonnegative
tensorsPk→Pwith nn-rank (Pk)≤rwe also have
nn-rank (P)≤r. For every P /∈CCorr (n,d,r )there
also exists a separating witness since the distance be-
tween CCorr (n,d,r )andPis strictly positive. More-
over, the sets of quantum correlations CQCorr Ω(n,d,r )
andQQCorr Ω(n,d,r )are closed if Ωis a tree.
4.2 Stability of separations for approximate ten-
sor decompositions
Various notions of positive tensor decompositions ex-
hibit separations [17], meaning that there exist fami-
lies of bipartite tensors (Td)d∈NwhereTd∈Cd⊗Cd
such that
rank(Td) = const. and psd-rank(Td)→∞.
Moreover, there is also a family of bipartite tensors
(Sd)d∈Nsuch that
psd-rank(Sd) = const. and nn-rank(Sd)→∞.
Are these separations robust with respect to approx-
imations? In [28] it is proven that for fixed approxi-
mation error ε>0and a fixed norm, the separations
between rank,psd-rank andnn-rank disappear. More,
precisely rankε(T),psd-rankε(T),nn-rankε(T)can be
upper bounded by a function depending only on εand
∥T∥, independent of the dimension of the tensor prod-
uct space. However, if the choice of ε>0and vector
space dimension is too small, this upper bound ex-
ceeds trivial dimension-dependent upper bounds. So,
the bounds are only meaningful when the dimension
of the tensor product space is large.
We will now prove a “dual” statement. If the dimen-
sion of the tensor product space is fixed, there exists
an errorε>0such that the separation between rank
andnn-rank persists.
Theorem 7. There exists a family of nonnegative
tensors (Tn)n∈NwithTn∈/parenleftbig
Cd/parenrightbig⊗nand a family of
approximation errors εn>0such that
nn-rankεn(Tn) =n.
We have also that
rankε(Tn) = psd-rankε(Tn) = 2
for everyε>0independent of n.
Note that a similar statement can be shown for ev-
ery notion of rank that does not exhibit a gap between
border rank and rank.

of separations [28]
Separations remain (Theorem 7)
Fig. 9: When do separations persist for approximate de-
compositions? Varying the system size for a fixed approxi-
mation error leads to the disappearance of separations [ 28],
however, when fixing the system size and choosing small
enough errors, the separations persist (Theorem 7). The red
area shows when the upper bounds derived in [ 28] are smaller
than the upper bounds of the exact decompositions, and the
blue area shows the approximation errors εnin Theorem 7.
Proof. LetTn=Wnthe family of Wn-states. For
fixedn∈N, we know that
nn-rank (Wn) = nn-rank( Wn) =n.
Therefore there exists a εn>0 such that
nn-rankεn(Wn) =n.
For the second statement, recall that
rank(Wn) = psd-rank (Wn) = 2.
Since
rankε(Wn)≤rank(Wn) = 2
and
psd-rankε(Wn)≤psd-rank (Wn) = 2
for everyε>0, this proves the statement.
5 Conclusions and Outlook
In this work, we have shown that many gaps between
ranks and border ranks persist when introducing pos-
itivity and invariance constraints for tensor decompo-
sitions, and explored its consequences. More precisely,
we have proven that:
(i) The standard and symmetric tensor decomposi-
tions exhibit gaps between border rank and rank
for the psd-decomposition and local purifications
(Section 3.1), and the gaps disappear for the
nonnegative and separable decomposition (The-
orem 3);
(ii) Most of the gaps persist for cyclic and transla-
tional invariant decompositions (Section 3.2 and
Section 3.3);
(iii) There are no gaps for tree tensor decompositions,
regardless of positivity constraints (Theorem 4);(iv) Upper bounds in the various positive ranks corre-
spond to membership in certain (quantum) cor-
relation sets (Theorem 6), which, together with
the gaps between border rank and rank, imply
that certain correlation sets are not topologically
closed.
Many examples exhibiting a separation are n-
partite tensor decompositions with n>3. This leaves
open the question whether gaps between border ranks
and ranks exist for positive and invariant 3-partite de-
compositions. Specifically, do
•psd-rank
•ti-psd-osr
•ti-nn-osr
exhibit a gap between border rank and rank for n= 3?
Moreover, it is open, whether there is a gap for psd-osr
for anyn. One further step would be to ask how big
the gaps between border rank and rank can be for
positive decompositions. We refer to [8] for a study
in the case of standard tensor decompositions without
positivity constraints.
Other surprising properties of tensor decomposi-
tions appearing already at n= 3 include the fact
that tensor rank and border rank are non-additive
with respect to the direct sum [37, 38, 39], and that
they are also non-multiplicative with respect to ten-
sor products [40, 41]. Do these properties also hold
for positive and invariant decompositions? And what
would be their implications for correlation scenarios?
Finally, there are positivity structures such as mul-
tipartite nonnegative and sum-of-squares polynomials
that behave very similarly to multipartite positive ten-
sors [42]. It would be interesting if positive decom-
positions of polynomials exhibit gaps between border
ranks and ranks.

A Tensor decompositions on general weighted simplicial complexes
Here, we review the framework introduced in [16] which generalizes tensor decompositions to arbitrary multi-
hypergraph (weighted simplicial complex) structures with arbitrary symmetry constraints. It is structured
as follows: In Appendix A.1, we review weighted simplicial complexes and group actions, which determine
the structure of the tensor decomposition. In Appendix A.2, we review the unconstrained, the non-negative,
and the positive semidefinite tensor decomposition on weighted simplicial complexes Ωtogether with a group
actionG. In Appendix A.3, we review the separable decomposition and the purification form as examples of
decompositions on matrix tensor product spaces. We also show that the examples discussed in the main text
are special instances of (Ω,G)-decompositions.
A.1 Weighted simplicial complexes and group actions
Here we give a definition of weighted simplicial complexes (wsc) Ωand group actions G[16]. Recall that [n]
denotes the set{1,...,n}, andPnthe power setP([n])(i.e. the set of all subsets of [n], which has 2nelements).
Definition 8. (i) A weighted simplicial complex (wsc) on [ n]is a function
Ω :Pn→N
whereS1⊆S2implies that Ω(S1)divides Ω(S2).
(ii) A setS∈Pnis called a simplex of Ω , ifΩ(S)̸= 0. We will assume that each singleton set {i}∈Pnis a
simplex, and the elements i∈[n]are the vertices of the wsc. A maximal simplex (with respect to inclusion of
sets) is a facet of Ω . The set of facets is denoted by
F:={F∈Pn:Ffacet of Ω}.
The set of facets which contain vertex iis denoted by
Fi:={F∈F:i∈F}.
The restriction of ΩtoFgives rise to the multiset /tildewideFwhich contains F∈F precisely Ω(F)-times. The multiset
/tildewideFifori∈[n]is defined analogously. There exists a canonical collapse map
c:/tildewideF→F andc:/tildewideFi→Fi
mapping all copies of a facet to the underlying facet.
(iii) Two vertices i,jareneighbors if
Fi∩Fj̸=∅
Two vertices i,jareconnected if there is a sequence of vertices i=i1,i2,...,ik=jsuch thatimandim+1are
neighbors for all m∈[k−1].
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 15Before introducing group actions on weighted simplicial complexes, we define the notions of G-linearity and
G-invariance.
Definition 9. LetGbe a group acting on the sets X,Y. A function f:X→Yis calledG-linear if
f(gx) =gf(x)
for allx∈Xandg∈G. IfGacts trivially on Y,fisG-invariant .
The definition of a group action on Ωis split into two parts. First, we consider a group action of Gon the set
[n]. Then, we extend this group action to the set of facets of Ω. Without loss of generality, Gcan be assumed
to be a subgroup of the permutation group on the set [n],Sn. Every group action on [n]canonically induces a
group action onPn. IfΩisG-invariant,Galso induces a group action on F, since forF∈F,g∈GandF⊊S
it holds that Ω(gS) = Ω(S) = 0 . This gives rise to the following definition.
Definition 10. A group action of Gon the wsc Ωconsists of the following:
(i)An action of Gon[n]such that ΩisG-invariant with respect to the induced action on Pn. This induces an
action ofGonF.
(ii) An action of Gon/tildewideFsuch that the collapse map
c:/tildewideF→F
isG-linear (we also say the action of Gon/tildewideFrefines the action of GonF).
In order to obtain a group action on a wsc, one does not only have to specify how a group acts on F, but
also how it permutes the copies of facets in the multiset /tildewideF.
Example 11 (Weighted simplicial complexes) .Let us consider three examples of wsc that lead to the decompo-
sitions studied in the main text.
(i)The “full simplex” Σ nis given by Σ n:Pn→N:S∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→1. The facet set is hence given by F=/braceleftbig
{1,...,n}/bracerightbig
.
Forn= 5, it is depicted as


1 : if|S|= 1 orS={i,i+ 1}fori∈[n−1] or{n,1}
0 : else.
Therefore, the set of facets is given by
F=/braceleftbig

.
Forn= 5, it is depicted as

Example 12 (Group actions on wsc) .(i)The group action Snof permutations on [ n] induces a group action
on the full simplex Σ nsinceSninduces a group action of SnonFby mapping the simplex {1,...,n}to
itself.
(ii)LetCn={e,τ,τ2,...,τn−1}be the group of translations on [ n], generated by τ: [n]→[n] which is defined
asτ(i) =i+ 1 fori∈[n−1] andτ(n) = 1.Cninduces a valid group action on the cycle Θ n, since facets
{i,i+ 1}are mapped to other facets {k,k+ 1}by applying multiples of τto every vertex. △
In the upcoming definition of (Ω,G)-decompositions (Definition 13) we use β∈I/tildewideFias summation indices.
For this reason, we understand βas a list of indices taking values in {1,...,d}where each index corresponds
to a facet in /tildewideFi, that is,β= (βF1,...,βFn)where/tildewideFi={F1,...,Fn}. Moreover, we define the computational
basis state corresponding to βas
|β⟩:=/circlemultiplydisplay
F∈/tildewideFi|βF⟩ ∈|/tildewideFi|/circlemultiplydisplay
i=1CI. (14)
For an element gof a groupGacting on/tildewideF, and a function (α:/tildewideF→I )∈I/tildewideF, we define
gα:/tildewideF→I :F∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→α(g−1F)
We will often restrict to functions β∈I/tildewideFi, i.e. defined on the facets /tildewideFicontaining vertex i. In this situation,
we have thatgβ:/tildewideFgi→I.
A.2 (Ω,G)-decompositions of nonnegative tensors
Let us now review the definition of (Ω,G)-decompositions on nonnegative tensors T∈Cd⊗···⊗ Cd. For a
more detailed exposition, we refer to [16, Section 5] and [15]. We call a tensor Tnonnegative ifTj1,...,jn≥0for
everyj1,...,jn∈{1,...,d}. For any function α:/tildewideF→I , we denote the restriction α|/tildewideFi:/tildewideFi→I byα|ifor
anyi∈[n].

Example 14 (Examples of (Ω ,G)-decompositions) .Let us now present examples of (Ω ,G)-decompositions
appearing in the main text.
(i)Let Ω = Σ nbe the fulln-simplex (see Example 11 (i)), i.e. the set of facets is a singleton F=/braceleftbig
{1,...,n}/bracerightbig

There is precisely one index in the decomposition; hence, a Σ n-decomposition is given by

where|T[i]

addition,|T[i]
α⟩is a nonnegative vector in the standard basis for every i∈{1,...,n}andα∈{1,...,r}, this
gives rise to a nonnegative Σ n-decomposition. A positive semidefinite Σ n-decomposition is given by

When considering Σ n-decompositions, we refer to their corresponding ranks via rank,nn-rank andpsd-rank
without the index Σ n.
(ii)LetG=Snbe the full permutation group acting on the simplex Σ n(see Example 12 (i)). A (Σ n,Sn)-
decomposition of|T⟩is given by the additional constraint |T[i1]

Remark 17. (Ω,G)-decompositions of matrices generalize (Ω ,G)-decompositions on tensors. Given a tensor
T∈Cd⊗···⊗ Cd, the diagonal matrix
ρT:= Diag(T):=d/summationdisplay
j1,...,jn=1Tj1,...,jn|j1,...,jn⟩⟨j1,...,jn|
is psd if and only if Tis entrywise nonnegative. Moreover, every nonnegative (Ω ,G)-decomposition of T
corresponds to a separable (Ω ,G)-decomposition of ρT, and every psd (Ω ,G)-decomposition of Tcorresponds to
a (Ω,G)-purification of ρT. In particular, we have that [16, Theorem 43]
(i) rank (Ω,G)(T) = rank (Ω,G)(ρT)
(ii) nn-rank (Ω,G)(T) = sep-rank(Ω,G)(ρT)
(iii) psd-rank(Ω,G)(T) = puri-rank(Ω,G)(ρT)

A.4 The structure tensor |Ωr⟩
We now introduce for every wsc Ωa corresponding structure tensor |Ωr⟩which has rank Ω(|Ωr⟩)≤r. This
tensor allows for a more compact representation of (Ω,G)-decompositions, which we will use in the proofs of
Theorem 29 and Theorem 31. Similar structure tensors, based on hyper-graphs, have been introduced in [44, 39].
Namely, for a given wsc Ω, we define
|Ωr⟩:=/summationdisplay

i=1Cri
whereI={1,...,r}andri=|I/tildewideFi|. Sinceβ∈I/tildewideFican be understood as an array of indices in {1,...,r},|β⟩
is defined as in Equation (14).
Choosing for example the cycle Θn, we obtain the n-fold matrix mutliplication (MaMu) tensor

Note that in both examples, the corresponding (Ω,G)-rank is given by the minimal parameter rin the structure
tensor that admits such a decomposition.
B Tensor rank inequalities
In the following, we will prove three inequalities used in the main text: that the rank of the Wn-state isn
(Appendix B.1), the relation between rank andpsd-rank (Appendix B.2), and a lower bound for the symmetric
psd-rank of Wn(Appendix B.3).
B.1 The rank of the Wn-state
Let us review a well-known example of a gap between border-rank and rank for the standard tensor rank. This
statement has been proven for n= 3in [6] and generalizes to larger n. We prove it here for completeness. The
Wn-state has been studied from many different perspectives, for example, also bounds on the rank of W⊗k
3have
been established in [8].
Proposition 18. Forn≥2, we have that rank(Wn) =n.
Proof. That rank(Wn)≤nis clear by the definition of Wn. We prove that rank(Wn)≥nby induction. The
casen= 2 is clear, since W2∈C2⊗C2corresponds to the matrix
W2=|0⟩⟨1|+|1⟩⟨0|
via the correspondence presented in Equation (1). Therefore W2has rank 2.
For the induction step n→n+ 1, suppose that Wn+1has rank(Wn+1)≤nwith a decomposition
Wn+1=n/summationdisplay
α=1|v[1]
α⟩⊗···⊗|v[n]
α⟩.
For system 1 we will prove that
(a) The vectors{|v[1]
α⟩}α=1,...,nspanC2.
(b)|v[1]
β⟩=cβ|0⟩for everyβ∈{1,...,n}.
These two conditions contradict each other, hence proving the statement of the proposition.
To prove (a) assume that the family {|v[1]
α⟩}α=1,...,ndoes not span C2. Then there exists a non-zero vector
|x⟩∈C2such that⟨x|v[1]
α⟩= 0 for every α. Appyling⟨x|to the first tensor factor of Wn+1leads to
0 =⟨x|0⟩Wn+⟨x|1⟩|0,0,0,..., 0⟩.
Since|Wn⟩and|0,..., 0⟩are linearly independent this implies that |x⟩= 0, which is a contradiction.
To prove (b), note that
rank(Wn+b|0,..., 0⟩)≥rank(Wn)≥n
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 22for everyb∈Rsince
Wn=A⊗n/parenleftig

with
A:|0⟩∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→| 0⟩,|1⟩∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→| 1⟩−b
n|0⟩.
This shows that rank(Wn+b|0,..., 0⟩)≥rank(Wn) since the rank is non-increasing under local operations.
Now letβ∈{1,...,r}be fixed and choose |x⟩∈C2such that⟨x|v[1]
β⟩= 0. Applying⟨x|to the first tensor
factor ofWn+1we obtain
n/summationdisplay
α=1,α̸=β⟨x|v[1]
α⟩|v[2]
α⟩⊗···⊗|v[n]
α⟩=⟨x|0⟩Wn+⟨x|1⟩|0,0,0,..., 0⟩
Since the sum on the left hand side contains n−1 elementary tensors and the right hand side has rank at least
n, if⟨x|0⟩̸= 0, it follows that ⟨x|0⟩= 0. But this implies that |v[1]
β⟩=cβ|0⟩.
Corollary 19. Forn≥3, we have that
rank(Wn) = 2<n= rank(Wn)
B.2 Relating rank andpsd-rank
We now review the inequality between rank and the psd-rank shown in [16, Corollary 44]. For completeness, we
also provide a proof of this statement.
Lemma 20 (Relation between rank and psd-rank) .LetΩbe a wsc and Ga group action on Ω. For every
nonnegative tensor T, we have
rank (Ω,G)(T)≤psd-rank(Ω,G)(T)2
Proof. Let

be a psd-decomposition of Twith psd-rank(Ω,G)(T) =|I|. Consider the new index set L:=I×I with the two
projections p1,2:L→I and define
⟨j|v[i]
β⟩:=/parenleftig
A[i]
j/parenrightig
p1◦β,p2◦β
for everyi∈[n],j∈{1,...,d}andβ∈L/tildewideFi. The new vectors {|vβ⟩}β∈L/tildewideFiprovide a (Ω ,G)-decomposition of T
with
rank (Ω,G)(T)≤|L| =|I|2= psd-rank(Ω,G)(T)2
which proves the statement.
B.3 A border rank gap for symmetric psd-decompositions in a tripartite system
We now prove that the there is a gap between border rank and rank for the symmetric psd-rank already for
n= 3.
Proposition 21. There is a gap between border rank and rank of W3for the symmetric psd-rank. Specifically
we have
symm-psd-rank (W3) = 2<3≤symm-psd-rank( W3)
Proof. That symm-psd-rank (W3) = 2 is proven in Equation (11).
Now assume that symm-psd-rank( W3) = 2. Then there exists a symmetric psd-decomposition
Wj1,j2,j3=2/summationdisplay
α,β=1(Aj1)α,β·(Aj2)α,β·(Aj3)α,β.
This decomposition can be expressed equivalently as
Wj1,j2,j3=⟨M|Aj1⋆Aj2⋆Aj3|M⟩
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 23where|M⟩= (1,..., 1)tand⋆is the Hadamard product, i.e.
(X⋆Y )α,β=Xα,β·Yα,β.
We claim that A0andA1in the decomposition have rank 1. Assume for example that A0has full rank, it is
positive definite, therefore A0⋆A0⋆A0is positive definite by Schur’s product theorem (see [ 45, Theorem 7.5.3.]).
But this implies that
0 =W0,0,0=⟨M|A0⋆A0⋆A0|M⟩>0.
The same applies to A1.
SinceA0,A1have rank 1, we can parametrize them as
Aj=
aj,0√aj,0aj,1exp(i2πφj)
√aj,0aj,1exp(−i2πφj) aj,1

whereaj,0,aj,1≥0. SinceW0,0,0=W1,1,1= 0, we have that aj,0=aj,1forj= 0,1 as well as φj= 1/2 which
implies that Wj1,j2,j3= 0 for allj1,j2,j3∈{0,1}.
C Positive Operator Valued Measures and Quantum Channels
We call a collection of matrices r×rmatrices (Aj)d
j=1apositive operator-valued measure (POVM), if Aj⩾0
and
d/summationdisplay
j=1Aj= 1r.
Note that if (Aj1)j1∈[d1],(Bj2)j2∈[d2]are POVMs, then the tensor product
(Aj1⊗Bj2)j1∈[d1],j2∈[d2]
is also a POVM. The definition of a POVM guarantees that for any quantum state |ψ⟩∈Crthed-ary array
/parenleftbig
pj:=⟨ψ|Aj|ψ⟩/parenrightbig
j=1,...,d
forms a probability distribution.
A linear mapE:Md1(C)→Md2(C)is called completely positive (cp), if idd′⊗Eis a positive map for every
d′∈N, i.e.
(idd′⊗E)(A)⩾0for every psd matrix A∈Md′(C)⊗Md1(C).
It is additionally called completely positive trace preserving (cptp) or quantum channel if it is cp and preserves
the trace, i.e. tr(E(A)) = tr(A)for everyA∈Md(C).
Note that every POVM (Aj)d
j=1gives rise to the following quantum channel:
E:ρ∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→d/summationdisplay
j=1|j⟩⟨j|tr(Ajρ). (16)
In words, it maps every state to the classical state (i.e. a probability distribution) that is obtained when
performing the measurement. Conversely, every quantum channel whose image consists only of diagonal matrices
gives rise to a POVM via Equation (16).
D The Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem and its Applications
In this part, we review a version of the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem. This allows to show that certain (Ω,G)-
decompositions do not have a gap between rank and border rank.
Let(V,∥·∥)be a finite-dimensional normed vector space. A set S⊆V isbounded if there exists a constant
C≥0such that∥x∥≤Cfor everyx∈S.Sisclosed if for every sequence (sk)k∈N∈SNthat converges to a
points∈Vwith respect to∥·∥, we have that s∈S.Siscompact if it is closed and bounded.
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 24Theorem 22 (Bolzano–Weierstraß for finite-dimensional vector spaces) .LetS⊆V be a compact subset of a
finite-dimensional vectorspace V. Then every sequence (si)i∈N∈SNhas a convergent subsequence, i.e. there is
strictly increasing sequence (kℓ)ℓ∈NinNsuch that
lim
ℓ→∞skℓ=s∈S.
We now apply it to the space of quantum channels. We denote CPTP (d1,d2)⊆Lin(Md1(C),Md2(C))the
set of quantum channels in Md1(C)→Md2(C).
Lemma 23. CPTP(d1,d2)is compact in Lin(Md1(C),Md2(C)).
Proof. Equipping the space Lin( Md1(C),Md2(C)) with the norm
∥E∥:= max
∥ρ∥1≤1∥E(ρ)∥1
where∥·∥ 1is the trace-norm on Mdi(C), we obtain that ∥E∥≤ 1 for everyE∈CPTP (d1,d2) which shows the
boundedness.
Moreover, CPTP (d1,d2) is closed since it can be characterized by the closed conditions idn⊗E(A)⩾0 for
every psdA∈Md1·n(C) and tr(E(ρ)) =tr(ρ) for everyρ∈Md1(C). Since intersections of closed sets are closed,
the statement follows.
Corollary 24. Every sequence of quantum channels has a convergent subsequence.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of Theorem 22 and Lemma 23.
E Nonnegative Σn-decompositions and causal structures
We now show that characterizing the nonnegative Σn-rank of a probability tensor Pis equivalent to Parising
from a specific Bayesian network with hidden complexity constraints. This statement has been proven in the
bipartite case [24] as well as in the multipartite case in [34].
Theorem 25 (The nonnegative rank and classical correlations) .LetP∈/parenleftbig
Rd/parenrightbig⊗nbe a nonnegative vector
representing a probability distribution, i.e.
Pj1,...,jn=P(X1=j1,...,Xn=jn).
The following are equivalent:
(i)nn-rank(P)≤r
(ii) There exists a random variable Ztaking values in{1,...,r}such that
P(X1=j1,...,Xn=jn) =r/summationdisplay
α=1P(X1=j1|Z=α)···P(Xn=jn|Z=α)·P(Z=α)
The same equivalence holds for symm-nn-rank with the additional constraint that the conditional probability
distributions P(Xi=−|Z=z)are identical for every i∈{1,...,n}.
As in the main text, we denote the set of all probability distributions satisfying (ii) by CCorr (n,d,r ).
Proof. We show the equivalence only for symm-nn-rank as the other follows analogously.
(i) =⇒(ii): Since symm-rank( P)≤rthere is a nonnegative decomposition

are identical, we have that |v[i]
α⟩=|v[j]
α⟩=:|vα⟩for everyi,j∈{1,...,n}. It is immediate that Equation (17)
holds.
F The purification-rank corresponds to minimal entanglement in a correlation
We now prove the characterization theorems for the psd-rank and for the purification-rank on the level of
arbitrary (Ω,G)-decompositions (see Theorem 6 in the main text for a simplified version). We first define the
correlation sets CQCorr (Ω,G)and QQCorr (Ω,G)(Appendix F.1) and subsequently prove the characterization of
psd-rank (Theorem 29) in Appendix F.2 and the characterization of puri-rank (Theorem 31) in Appendix F.3.
F.1 The correlation sets
In the following, we define the set CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )and the set QQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r ). Intuitively, every element
in either set is generated by an n-partite quantum state as a resource that satisfies rank (Ω,G)(|ψ⟩)≤r. In other
words,|ψ⟩is limited in its entanglement structure. An n-partite probability distribution with local dimension
dinCQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )is then generated via a POVM on each tensor product factor, and an n-partite mixed
state in CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )is generated via quantum channel on each tensor product factor. Moreover, if Gis
non-trivial, then the POVMs and the quantum channels satisfy additionally a symmetry constraint.
Definition 26 (Quantum correlation scenarios for (Ω ,G)-structures) .

We will prove the correspondence between these sets of correlations and sets of low-rank tensors for arbitrary
wscΩand a certain subclass of group actions on Ω, called external group actions.
Definition 27 (External group action) .LetΩbe a wsc. We call a group action of GonΩ external , if
∀g∈Gs.t.gi=iwe have that gF=Ffor everyF∈/tildewideFi.
Intuitively, an external group action of Gdoes not give rise to any local constraints on the tensors. It only
gives rise to constraints between tensors of different local systems.
Example 28 (Examples of (non-)external group actions) .All group actions used in the main text (see Figure 2)
are external:
(i)The group action Cnon then-cycle Θnis external. This follows since the only g∈Cnsuch thatgi=ifor
somei∈[n] is the neutral element which also keeps the facets fixed.
(ii)The group action Snon then-simplex Σ nis external. In contrast to (i), there are g∈Snsuch thatgi=i
for somei∈[n]. However, since /tildewideF=/tildewideFiare singletons the facet keeps trivially fixed.
For a group action that is not external, consider the line Λ 3with 3 vertices (see Example 11) together with
the group action C3generated from the reflection τ: 1∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→3,2∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→2,3∝⇕⊣√∫⊔≀→1 and its induced action on the facets.
C3is not external on Λ 3sinceτ(2) = 2 while τF1=F2. The corresponding (Λ 3,C3)-decomposition is given by
T=r/summationdisplay
α,β=1|vα⟩⊗|wα,β⟩⊗|vα⟩
with the additional constraint |wα,β⟩=|wβ,α⟩for everyα,β∈{1,...,r}. The appearing “internal” symmetry
constraint on the local family of tensors {|wα,β⟩}α,βmotivates the name of the definition. △
F.2 Correspondence between psd-rank and CQCorr
We now prove the first part of Theorem 6, namely that elements of CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )are precisely these
tensors with psd-rank(Ω,G)(P)≤r. A similar statement in a special case (namely Ω = ΣnandG={e}) is
proven by Jain et al [23, Theorem 13].
Theorem 29 (The psd-rank and quantum correlation scenarios) .LetΩbe a wsc and Gan external group action
onΩ. Further, let P∈/parenleftbig
Rd/parenrightbig⊗nbe ann-fold probability distribution. The following are equivalent:
(i)P∈CQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r ).
(ii)psd-rank(Ω,G)(P)≤r.
We first need a preparatory lemma.
Lemma 30 (G-symmetric matrix diagonalization) .LetΩbe a wsc and Gan external group action on Ω. Let
K[i]∈MI/tildewideFi(C)fori= 1,...,n be a family of Hermitian matrices such that

F.3 Correspondence between puri-rank and QQCorr
We now prove the quantum version of Theorem 29, namely that elements of QQCorr (Ω,G)(n,d,r )are precisely
psd matrices ρwith tr(ρ) = 1 and puri-rank(Ω,G)(ρ)≤r. The proof of this statement is similar to that
of Theorem 29. In particular, it first restricts to density matrices which are diagonal in the computational
basis according to Remark 17 and then uses the fact that quantum channels whose image are diagonal states
correspond to POVMs (see Equation (16)).
Theorem 31 (The puri-rank and quantum correlation scenarios) .LetΩbe a wsc and Gan external group

using the structure-tensor |Ωr⟩according to Equation (15) (in this setting|Ωr⟩is a MaMu tensor). This decomposition can
also be understood as applying a cp map to |Ωr⟩according to Equation (23). In (c) we insert a projector P[i]of the space
where the tensor L[i]acts non-trivially and factorize it into a product T[i]·W[i]according to Equation (24) . To obtain (d) we
merge the upper box ( T[i]) with the red box (Equation (25)). This gives rise to a normalized state (Equation (26)) together
with local quantum channels (e).
G Nonnegative and separable decompositions and the proof of Theorem 3
We now prove that the nonnegative and the separable Σn-decompositions do not exhibit a gap between border
rank and rank. This generalizes the result that the nonnegative matrix rank and the nonnegative tensor rank
are lower semicontinuous [46, 30].
Theorem 32. Let(ρn)n∈Nbe a sequence of separable matrices with ρn→ρandsep-rank(ρn)≤r. Then
sep-rank(ρ)≤r
The same statement applies to symm-sep-rank ,nn-rank andsymm-nn-rank .
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 31This entails the following.
Corollary 33. There is no gap between border rank and rank for nn-rank ,symm-nn-rank ,sep-rank and
symm-sep-rank .
To prove Theorem 32 we need the following preparatory lemma.
Lemma 34. LetA,B∈M+
d(C). Then,
max/braceleftbig
λmax(A),λmax(B)/bracerightbig
≤λmax(A+B)
Proof. Let
RX(x):=⟨x|X|x⟩
⟨x|x⟩
forx∈Cd. We have that RA(x) +RB(x) =RA+B(x) and since A,B are psd, we have that RA(x),RB(x)≥0
for everyx. This implies that
max{RA(x),RB(x)}≤RA+B(x).
Sinceλmax(X) = maxx∈CdRX(x), the result follows.
Proof of Theorem 32. We prove it for symm-sep-rank . The proof for sep-rank is analogous, and the proof
fornn-rank andsymm-nn-rank follows from restricting to diagonal matrices and the fact that nn-rank (T) =
sep-rank(Diag( T)) (see Remark 17).
Let (ρk)k∈Nbe a sequence of separable matrices with symm-sep-rank (ρk)≤r, i.e. with a separable decompo-
sition
ρk=r/summationdisplay
α=1ρα,k⊗···⊗ρα,k
withρα,kpsd. Since all elementary tensors are themselves psd, we have that for all α,k
∥ρα,k∥n
∞=∥ρ⊗n
α,k∥∞≤∥ρk∥∞≤∥ρ∥∞+C
for some constant C∈Nwhere the first equality is true since λmax(ρ⊗n) =λmax(ρ)n, the first inequality follows
by Lemma 34, and the last inequality follows from the convergence of ρktoρ.
This implies that ( ρα,k)k∈Nis a bounded sequence. By the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem (Theorem 22) there
is a subsequence ( kℓ)ℓ∈Nsuch thatρα,kℓconverges to a limiting point ραwhich is again psd. Since ρk→ρby
assumption, we have that
ρ=r/summationdisplay
α=1ρα⊗···⊗ρα,
i.e. symm-sep-rank( ρ)≤r, which shows the statement.
H Tree tensor decompositions and the proof of Theorem 4
Here we prove that no decomposition shows gap between border rank and rank whenever Ωis a tree. While
this is known for unconstrained tensor decompositions (see [3, 5]), this was not known for positive tensor
decompositions, to the best of our knowledge.
We call a wsc Ωatreeif it satisfies the two following conditions:
(i) The facets of Ωrepresent a graph, i.e. Ωis a simplicial complex and for every F∈/tildewideF, we have|F|≤2.
(ii) There are no loops in Ω, i.e. for every sequence i1,...,inof vertices such that
{i1,i2},{i2,i3},...,{in−1,in},{in,i1}∈/tildewideF
we have that i1=i2=...=in.
In Appendix H.1 we review the result for unconstrained tensor decompositions, following [3]. In Appendix H.2,
we prove the main statement for separable and nonnegative tensor decompositions, and in Appendix H.3 we
show the main result for psd-decompositions and local purification forms.
Accepted in Quantum2025-02-17, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 32H.1 Unconstrained tree tensor decompositions
In this part, we review the result that unconstrained Ω-decompositions on trees Ωdo not exhibit a gap between
border-rank and rank, i.e.
rankΩ(T) = rank Ω(T)
The idea is as follows. A tensor decomposition where a index only joins two local spaces, such as
T=r/summationdisplay
α=1|vα⟩⊗|wα⟩
corresponds to a matrix factorization T=A·BwithA∈Md,r(C)andB∈Mr,d(C), where each column of
Ais given by a vector |vα⟩and each row of Bis given by a vector |wα⟩. Note that there is a “gauge freedom”
in these decompositions, as specifically, for every X∈Mr,r(C)invertible,/tildewideA=A·X−1and/tildewideB=X·Bgive
rise to a new decomposition of Tof the same rank. Computing a thin (or reduced) QR-decomposition of A[47,
Chapter 5], we obtain A=Q·RwithQbeing an isometry in Md,r(C)andR∈Mr(C)being an invertible
matrix. Hence, /tildewideA:=Qand/tildewideB:=R·Bgive rise to a decomposition where all tensor factors in the first part form
an orthonormal basis, and the local vectors satisfy normalization conditions with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt
norm

Similarly, one shows that for any tree Ωthere exists a normalized Ω-decomposition. Such decompositions are
known as left-canonical forms in the tensor network literature (see [48, 3]).
Lemma 35. Let|ψ⟩∈Cd⊗···⊗ CdandΩbe a tree with rank Ω(ψ)≤r. There exists a decomposition
|ψ⟩=W[1]⊗···⊗W[n]|Ωr⟩
such that
∥W[i]∥2=√rfori= 1,...,n−1,and∥W[n]∥2=/radicalbig
⟨ψ|ψ⟩
Proof. Follows directly from the proof in [3, Proposition 1].
Lemma 35 entails that there is no gap between border rank and rank for unconstrained Ω-decompositions
whenever Ωis a tree.
Theorem 36. IfΩis a tree, then rank Ω= rankΩ.
Proof. Let|ψk⟩be a sequence of states with |ψk⟩→|ψ⟩such that rank Ω(|ψk⟩)≤r. We show that rank Ω(|ψ⟩)≤r.
By Lemma 35 there exists tensor decomposition

(Theorem 22), there exists subsequence ( W[i]
kℓ)ℓ∈Nconverging to a matrix W[i]for everyi∈{1,...,n}which
implies that
|ψ⟩=W[1]⊗···⊗W[n]|Ωr⟩.

Here we prove that nonnegative and separable tensor decompositions on trees Ωexhibit no gap between rank
and border rank. The proof strategy is similar to that of Σn-decompositions: We show that there exist a decom-
position of minimal rank with a bounding constraint, and then apply the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem. In this
part, we prove the statement only for separable Ω-decompositions; the result for nonnegative Ω-decompositions
follows by restricting to diagonal matrices and the fact that sep-rankΩ(Diag(T)) =nn-rank Ω(T)(see Remark 17).
We start by constructing a tensor decomposition of minimal rank where every local element satisfies a certain
bounding constraint.
Lemma 37. LetΩbe a tree and ρ∈Md(C)⊗na separable matrix with sep-rankΩ(ρ)≤r. There exists a

Forn= 1 (i.e. a single vertex) the statement is trivial.
For the induction step n−1→n, choose a joint Ω-decomposition according to Equation (27) without
normalization constraints. We assume without loss of generality that vertex nis connected to precisely two
other vertices.6We denote the vertices of the first subtree Ω 1by{1,...,k 1}, and the vertices on the second
subtree Ω 2by{k1+ 1,...,n−1}. Moreover, vertices k1andn−1 are connected to vertex n(Figure 12). For
this reason, we can rewrite the separable Ω-decomposition ρδas

H.3 The purification rank and the positive semidefinite rank on trees
Here we prove that for every tree Ω, neither psd Ω-decompositions nor Ω-purifications exhibit a gap between
rank and border rank. The proof strategy is similar to other cases without gaps: We use that there is a bounded
decomposition with the same expressiveness and then apply the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem. In this case, we
additionally use the correspondence to correlation scenarios (Theorem 31) and Theorem 36.
Theorem 39. LetΩbe a tree. Then, psd-rankΩ= psd-rankΩandpuri-rankΩ= puri-rankΩ.
Proof. We prove the statement only for puri-rankΩas the case of psd-rankΩworks similarly. Let ( ρk)k∈Nbe
a sequence of psd matrices such that puri-rankΩ(ρk)≤randρk→ρ. To see that puri-rankΩ(ρ)≤r, by
Theorem 31 there exists a sequence of states |ψk⟩with rank Ω(|ψk⟩)≤rand a sequence of quantum channels
E(k)
ifor everyi∈[n] such that
ρk=/parenleftig
E(k)
1⊗···⊗E(k)
n/parenrightig
(|ψk⟩⟨ψk|).
Since the space of quantum states is compact (we have that ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1 for every|ψ⟩), and since the space
of cptp maps is compact by Lemma 23, there exists a joint subsequence kℓsuch thatEi:=limℓ→∞E(kℓ)
iand
|ψ⟩:= limℓ→∞|ψkℓ⟩, which implies that
ρ= (E1⊗···⊗En)(|ψ⟩⟨ψ|).
Since rank Ω= rankΩ, we have that rank Ω(|ψ⟩)≤r, which proves that puri-rankΩ(ρ)≤r.
The proof for the psd-rank similarly uses Theorem 29 and the fact that every sequence of a POVM has a
convergent subsequence that converges to a POVM by the Bolzano–Weierstraß Theorem.
