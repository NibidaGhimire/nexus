ABSTRACT
We present a detailed study of cool, neutral gas traced by Ly 𝛼around 4595 𝑧 <0.5galaxies using stacks of background quasar
spectra.ThegalaxiesareselectedfromourMUSEQuBESlow- 𝑧surveyalongwithdatafromtheliterature.Thesegalaxies,witha
medianstellarmassof log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)=10.0,areprobedby184backgroundquasarsgivingriseto5054quasar-galaxypairs.The
median impact parameter is 𝑏=1.5pMpc (median 𝑏/𝑅vir=10.4) with 204 (419) quasar-galaxy pairs probing 𝑏/𝑅vir<1(2).
We find excess absorption out to at least ≈15𝑅virtransverse distance and ≈±600 km s−1along the line of sight. We show that
the median stacked profile for the full sample, dominated by the pairs with 𝑏 > 𝑅 vir, can be explained by a galaxy-absorber
two-point correlation function with 𝑟0=7.6pMpc and𝛾=−1.57. There are strong indications that the inner regions ( ≲𝑅vir)
of the rest equivalent width profile are better explained by a log-linear (or a Gaussian) relation whereas the outer regions are
well described by a power-law, consistent with galaxy-absorber large-scale clustering. Using a sub-sample of 339 galaxies (442

1 INTRODUCTION
It is now well established that the luminous parts of galaxies are
surrounded by a large reservoir of low-density, diffuse gas called
the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The CGM serves as a bridge
between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM). However,
thereisnoconsensusontheactualextentofthismediumsurrounding
galaxies.
Absorption line spectroscopy of bright background sources such
as quasars paved the way to study these elusive media, which are
otherwise difficult to detect in emission. The advancement of sensi-
tive space-based detectors such as the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph
(COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope ( 𝐻𝑆𝑇) has drastically
increasedourabilitytostudythediffusegasaroundgalaxiesoverthe
last two decades. Several surveys have established the connections
between the CGM and many key galaxy properties using absorp-
tion line spectroscopy of background quasars (e.g., Tumlinson et al.
2017; Péroux & Howk 2020). Alongside the rapidly accumulating
data from galaxy surveys to probe the CGM, the advent of new
★E-mail: sayak18@iucaa.inphysical prescriptions for gas flows with new numerical methods
andfastercomputerscontinuestoposefundamentalquestionsabout
galaxy formation and evolution. Theoretical studies indeed suggest
that the distribution of gas and metals surrounding galaxies is in-
tricately linked to processes such as gas accretion, galactic winds,
mergers, and stripping that dictate galactic evolution (e.g., Rahmati
et al. 2016; van de Voort et al. 2019; Oppenheimer et al. 2020;
Appleby et al. 2022; Mitchell & Schaye 2022). It is thus crucial to
map the distributions of diffuse matter surrounding galaxies with a
range of galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass ( 𝑀∗), star formation
rate (SFR), specific-SFR (sSFR)) to gain insight into such physical
processes.
The semi-empirical relation between the stellar mass to halo
mass ratio ( 𝑀∗/𝑀halo) as a function of 𝑀haloshows a peak at
𝑀halo≈1012M⊙, suggesting that these halos are most efficient
in converting baryons into stars (e.g., Conroy et al. 2006; Behroozi
et al. 2013, 2019). It is not well understood why halos of a certain
mass have higher star formation efficiencies (SFE). Energy and mo-
mentumfeedbackduetosupernovae(SNe)andactivegalacticnuclei
(AGN) is thought to suppress the SFE for the low-mass and high-
mass halos, respectively (see e.g., Bower et al. 2006; Somerville
©2023 The AuthorsarXiv:2303.16933v2  [astro-ph.GA]  25 Jan 20242 S. Dutta et al.
et al. 2008; Crain et al. 2015) . Theoretical models suggest two dis-
tinct modes of gas accretion depending on the halo mass: (a) “hot
mode” for galaxies with 𝑀halo>1012M⊙and (b) “cold mode” for
galaxies with 𝑀halo<1012M⊙(see e.g., Kereš et al. 2005; van de
Voort et al. 2011). The halos of masses ≈1012M⊙benefits from
boththemodes.Thus,thehigherSFEforthesehalosmayberelated

of stellar/halo mass.
The connection between galaxies and the cool, neutral gas sur-
roundingthemhaslongbeenasubjectofresearch,bothobservational
and theoretical. Chen et al. (2005) first observed a morphology de-
pendentgalaxy–Ly 𝛼absorbercross-correlationfunction.Theyfound
thatthecross-correlationfunctionbetweenLy 𝛼absorbers(withcol-
umn density 𝑁(Hi)>1014cm−2) and absorption-line dominated
galaxies within a projected distance of 1ℎ−1Mpc is significantly
lowercomparedtoemission-linedominatedgalaxies(seealsoChen
& Mulchaey 2009). On the other hand, later CGM surveys such as
COS-Halos did not find any significant difference in the H icontent
(rest-frameequivalentwidth(REWor 𝑊𝑟)andcolumndensity( 𝑁))
around star-forming and passive galaxies on CGM scales (typically
within 0.5𝑅vir; see e.g., Thom et al. 2012; Tumlinson et al. 2013).
Althoughasmallfractionofthepassivegalaxiesintheirsampledid
not exhibit any detectable Ly 𝛼absorption, overall the detected Ly 𝛼
absorptionwassimilararoundthestar-formingandpassivegalaxies.
Earlier, Chen et al. (1998, 2001) noted that the 𝑊𝑟-profile of
Ly𝛼absorptionaroundgalaxiesdependsonthe 𝐾-bandand𝐵-band
luminosities(proxiesforthe 𝑀∗andrecentSFR,respectively).Com-
bining the observational data from the COS-Halos and COS-Dwarf
(Bordoloietal.2014)surveys,Borthakuretal.(2016)foundastrong
anti-correlation between Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟and sSFR. Additionally, they re-
ported similar exponential scale lengths of the Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟-profile for
passiveandstar-forminggalaxies.Thelargerdispersionintheradial
distribution seen for passive galaxies has been interpreted as an in-
dication of patchiness in their CGM. A positive correlation between
Ly𝛼𝑊𝑟andstellarmasswasreportedbyBordoloietal.(2018).More
recently,Wildeetal.(2021)presentedtheLy 𝛼coveringfraction-and
column density-profiles for three different bins of stellar mass. The
covering fraction profiles were found to be very different for the
high-mass(𝑀∗>109.9M⊙)andlow-mass( 𝑀∗<109.2M⊙)galax-
ies in their sample. The Ly 𝛼covering fraction is as high as ≈90%
within𝑅virfor the high-mass subsample, but gradually declines to
only≈20% at𝑏/𝑅vir≈6. The covering fraction for the low-mass
sub-sample, on the other hand, remains roughly constant at ≈40%
all the way out to≈6𝑅vir.
Although the CGM is thought to play a crucial role in driving
galaxy evolution, there is no consensus on the extent of the CGM
around galaxies.It is generallythought that theCGM extendsout to
thevirialradiusofagalaxy(Tumlinsonetal.2017).However,Wilde
et al. (2021) recently argued that the CGM traced by neutral hydro-
gen extends beyond the virial radius (see also Wilde et al. 2023). In
the study by Prochaska et al. (2011), the detection rate and 𝑊𝑟of
Ly𝛼absorbersarefoundtobecorrelatedwithgalaxiesouttoatleast
1pMpc, far beyond the virialized halos of the galaxies. They, how-
ever, suggested that the weak Ly 𝛼absorbers arising at large impact
parameters(𝑏)maybeunrelatedtothegaseoushalosaroundgalaxies,
andmaybetracingthelarge-scaleenvironmentsinwhichthegalaxies
areembedded.Tejosetal.(2014)studiedthegalaxy–Ly 𝛼absorption
correlation function and found that it is significantly different from
thegalaxy–galaxyautocorrelationfunction,andthedifferenceispri-
marilydrivenby‘weak’H iabsorbers(𝑁(Hi)<1014cm−2).They
concluded that >50%of weak absorbers are not correlated withgalaxies, and hence, galaxies and these absorbers may not trace the
same underlying dark matter distribution. Wakker et al. (2015) used
theLy𝛼absorptiontostudynearbygalaxyfilamentsusing 𝐻𝑆𝑇/COS
spectraof24backgroundAGN.Theyobservedatrendofincreasing
Ly𝛼equivalent width and line width with decreasing filament im-
pact parameter. The Ly 𝛼absorption detection rate is ≈80% within

galaxypairswithawiderangeofimpactparameters,suchastheone
presented here, is essential to probe the inner and outer regions of
galaxy halos simultaneously. This, in turn, allows one to investigate
the extent of the so-called CGM.
In order to build a statistically significant sample of background
quasar–foregroundgalaxypairs,wecompileddatafromseverallow- 𝑧

galaxies with a wide range of stellar masses simultaneously.
Although MUSE can detect pure line emitters without any de-
tectable continuum, we restricted our analysis to the continuum-
detected galaxies in order to be able to estimate their stellar (halo)
mass. Our deep observations with MUSE (2–10 hours of exposure
time per field) enable us to obtain a galaxy sample of relatively low
mass(median 𝑀∗∼108M⊙)comparedtotheexistingCGMsurveys
intheliterature.TheMUSEQuBESgalaxiesalongwiththearchival
galaxy samples allow us to explore the uncharted territory of the
CGM around low-mass, intermediate redshift galaxies (see orange
points in Fig. 1).
Instead of the usual practice of identifying individual absorp-
tionfeaturesinquasarspectraandassociatingthemwithforeground
galaxies, we used the spectral stacking method to map the H igas,
tracedbytheLy 𝛼absorption,intheCGM.ThestackofLy 𝛼absorp-
tionattherest-frameofgalaxiesprovidesstatisticalinferenceonthe

of galaxy-absorber association based on LOS velocity cuts (e.g.,
±300km s−1or±500km s−1)suffersfromprojectioneffects,which
are more prominent at larger impact parameters. Spectral stacking
enables us to be agnostic about the individual galaxy-absorber as-
sociations. Further, stacking a large galaxy sample can significantly
improve the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Stacking, however,

observation block of 1 h was split into 4 ×900 s exposures, which
were rotated by 90◦and offset by a small ≈1−5′′shift from each
other. The data reduction is performed using the standard MUSE
data reduction pipeline (v1.2; Weilbacher et al. 2020), adopting the
default (recommended) set of parameters. A few additional reduc-
tion procedures using the CubExpackage (Cantalupo et al. 2018)
were carried out to improve flat-fielding and sky-subtraction using
theCubeFix andCubeSharp routines, respectively. The procedure
is detailed in Borisova et al. (2016), and more recently in Muzahid
et al. (2021).

Thedetailsofgalaxyidentificationsandgalaxypropertymeasure-
ments will be presented in a future work. Here, we briefly outline
the main steps. First, we run the Source Extractor (SExtractor;
Bertin, E. & Arnouts, S. 1996) on the MUSE white-light images
using a detection threshold of 1𝜎per pixel ( DETECT_TRESH = 1 )
and requiring a minimum number of neighbouring pixels above the
threshold of 3 ( DETECT_MINAREA = 3 ). The 1D spectra of the
continuum-detected objects, extracted from the MUSE cubes using
the SExtractor-generated segmentation maps, are then inspected by
amodifiedversionof MARZ(Hintonetal.2016)todeterminetheirredshifts based on the spectral features. The redshifts are further re-
fined using a modified version of the code PLATEFIT (Brinchmann
et al. 2004) by fitting Gaussian profiles to the available emission
andabsorptionlinefeatures.NotethatthewavelengthsintheMUSE
datacubesaregiveninair.Weappliedappropriatecorrectionswhile
determining the galaxy redshifts.
TheH𝛼or[O ii](whenH𝛼isnotcoveredornotdetectedat >3𝜎)
line fluxes returned by PLATEFIT are used to estimate the SFRs
of the galaxies using the relation from Kennicutt (1998) or from
Kewley et al. (2004, for O iiluminosities) adjusted for the Chabrier
(2003) initial mass function (IMF). The H 𝛼emission-line flux is

BycomparingH 𝛼/H𝛽toitsintrinsicvalueof2.85,correspondingto
Case B recombination at a temperature of 𝑇∼104K and electron
densities of𝑛e∼102−104cm−3(Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), we

spectra,weuseH 𝛽tocalculatetheSFR,undertheconditionthatwe
can correct the line flux for dust extinction using the H 𝛽/H𝛾ratio.
WerequirethatbothH 𝛽andH𝛾bedetectedwith 𝑆/𝑁 > 3.Wethen
convert the corrected H 𝛽flux into the H 𝛼flux to obtain the SFR,
making use of the known intrinsic ratio between the H 𝛼and H𝛽
fluxes. Dust correction is not performed for galaxies with O iibased
SFR measurements.
The stellar masses of galaxies are estimated using stellar popula-
tion synthesis (SPS) code FAST(Kriek et al. 2009), which fits SPS
templates to a set of photometric flux values. Owing to the lack of
ancillary photometric data of the quasar fields in our sample, we
constructed 11 pseudo-filters with a width of 400 Å each and span-
ning the wavelength range from 4800–9200 Å, after masking the
prominent emission lines. We calculated the filter flux by convolv-
ing the 1D galaxy spectrum– the same one as used for the redshift
determination with MARZ– with a boxcar function centered at 𝜆=
5000, 5400, . . . Å. The halo mass and virial radius, defined as the
mass and radius of a spherical region within which the mean mass
densityis200timesthecriticaldensityoftheuniverse,areestimated
from stellar mass and redshift measurements of galaxies using the
abundance matching relation from Moster et al. (2013)
In total, we have 475 galaxies detected in the 16 MUSE fields.
Note that these are galaxies detected 3000 km s−1blueward of the
corresponding quasar redshifts. The galaxies have redshifts ranging
from 0.05−1.4, and stellar masses and SFRs ranging from 106.0
to1011.8M⊙and10−3to102.7M⊙yr−1with the median values
of108.9M⊙and10−0.7M⊙yr−1, respectively. The galaxies have
impact parameters from the corresponding background quasars in
the range 10–320 pkpc with a median value of 150 pkpc (median
𝑏/𝑅vir=1.7).
2.2 Galaxy sample from the literature
Besides the MUSEQuBES galaxies, we combined galaxy samples
from six different CGM surveys from the literature; namely COS-
Halos (Tumlinson et al. 2013), Liang & Chen (2014), COS-Dwarf
(Bordoloi et al. 2014), COS-Gass (Borthakur et al. 2015), Johnson

2.3 Quasar spectra and continuum fitting
Galaxies from the MUSEQuBES survey were detected in 16 fields
centered on 16 UV-bright quasars. As mentioned earlier, these
quasars were chosen solely based on their FUV brightness and the
availabilityofhigh 𝑆/𝑁COSspectra.TheCOSspectraofthequasars
that are part of the six studies from the literature are also available
in the𝐻𝑆𝑇public archive. In total, we obtained 190 COS spectra in
reducedformfromthe 𝐻𝑆𝑇SpectroscopicLegacyArchive(HSLA;
Peeples et al. 2017). COS has a resolving power of 𝑅≈18,000
(FWHM≈18 km s−1).
Among the 190 quasars, 135 are observed with both the G130M
and G160M gratings covering 1150–1800 Å. The remaining 55
quasars are observed with the G130M grating only, which has a
spectralcoverageof1150–1450Å.TheG130MandG160Mgrating

theaverage𝑆/𝑁perpixelbecomesequal(typicallyaround1424Å).
The quasar redshifts range from 0.03–1.88 with a median of 0.43.
These 190 quasar spectra have a wide range of 𝑆/𝑁, with some
quasars having 𝑆/𝑁as low (high) as 1–2 (85–90) per resolution
element. The median 𝑆/𝑁per resolution element in the G130M
for the 190 spectra is ≈10, computed around 1250 Å. The median
𝑆/𝑁for the G160M grating is ≈7, computed near 1650 Å. Note
that we did not impose any 𝑆/𝑁cut while selecting the quasars.
This is because only 19 (39) spectra have 𝑆/𝑁 < 5in the G130M
(G160M) grating, covering redshifted Ly 𝛼absorption for only 72
(25)galaxies.Weverifiedthatexcludingtheselow- 𝑆/𝑁spectradoes
not have a significant effect on our results.
Weperformedcontinuumfittingforallofthese190spectrausing
a custom-made, semi-automated pythonroutine which finds the
absorption-free regions in a spectrum in an automated way. First,
each spectrum is divided into several chunks and fluxes are sigma
clippedwithanupperboundof 50𝜎(totakeintoaccounttheemissionlinesaswell).Thelowerboundsofsigmaclippingarevariedbetween
2.5, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.3 𝜎for regions with median 𝑆/𝑁(per pixel) of
>10,3−10,2−3,and<2,respectively.Thesenumberswerechosen
after many trials on randomly selected spectra from our sample and
by visually inspecting the quality of the continuum model. Next,
we increased the chunk size (or decreased the number of chunks)
in iterations and repeated the clippings, until the number of clipped
pixelsconverges,orthenumberofchunksisreducedto2,whichever
happens first. Then, we used spline fitting for the absorption-free
pixels to estimate the continuum. The number of ‘knots’ around the
known emission lines of Ly 𝛼CivNvand O viare increased (if
present in the spectra) to take care of larger curvatures.
2.4 Quasar-galaxy pairs
Using the 190 quasars in the background of ≈9000galaxies we
constructed quasar-galaxy pairs using the following two conditions:
(1)Theprojecteddistanceofagalaxyfromthecorrespondingquasar
sightline,𝑏 <3000pkpc. (2) The line of sight (LOS) separation of
a galaxy from the background quasar is >2000 km s−1. The large
impact parameter cut-off of 3000 pkpc was chosen to sample the
large-scale environments of the galaxies. The limiting LOS separa-
tionof2000 km s−1fromthequasarwaschosentoavoidthequasar’s
proximity zones and associated absorbers arising from the quasars
(e.g., Muzahid et al. 2013). Using these criteria, we obtained a total
of6020quasar-galaxypairswith5310uniquegalaxies.Someofthe
galaxies in this work are probed by multiple quasars. For example,
theCOS-GASSandCOS-Dwarfsurveysarerestrictedtoimpactpa-
rametersof250pkpcand150pkpc,respectively.However,afraction
of these galaxies is also probed by quasars at a transverse distance
of≈1pMpc. These provide us with more skewers at larger impact
parameters, and hence are included in our studies (see blue squares
andredcrossesat≈1pMpcintop-leftpanelofFig.1).Weobtained
the redshift, stellar mass, virial radius, and SFR (when available)
for all the galaxies from the literature, except for the MUSEQuBES
galaxies.Thereareonly634galaxies,constituting882quasar-galaxy
pairs, for which SFRs are known (including upper limits).

Note that the redshifted Ly 𝛼absorption cannot be observed with
COS for all of these galaxies as the spectral coverage of COS al-
lows a maximum observable redshift of 0.48(0.19) for Ly𝛼for the
G160M (G130M) grating. Below, we describe our scheme to obtain
the galaxies contributing to the Ly 𝛼stacks.
First, we masked the following regions of the COS spectra:
•1212–1220 Å – to exclude the geocoronal Ly 𝛼emission and
Galactic Ly𝛼absorption.
•1301–1307 Å – to exclude the geocoronal [O i] emission.
•AllwavelengthsbelowtheLymanlimit(rest-frame912Å)when
a Lyman limit system (LLS; log10𝑁(Hi)/cm−2>17.2) is present.
•±0.5Å around known strong Galactic absorption lines (e.g.,
Ni, Siii). At this point, we note that while ±0.5Å does not exclude
all high-velocity clouds (HVCs), we verified that a broader mask of
±1.0Å does not change any of our conclusions.
The only galaxies for which the redshifted Ly 𝛼wavelengths
(±0.05 Å) fall within the spectral coverage of the corresponding
quasarspectraareconsideredhere.Theaboveconditionsledtoato-
talof5054galaxy-quasarpairs,with184backgroundquasarsprobing

groundquasars,givingrisetoatotalof442quasar-galaxypairs.We
note here that a significant fraction (152/442) of them are arising
from our MUSEQuBES survey. The SFR is measured (not a limit)
for 289 galaxies, constituting 389 galaxy-quasar pairs.

The presence of correlations between different galaxy properties
is clearly visible in Fig. 1, particularly between the stellar mass and
redshift.TheSpearmanrankcorrelationtestresultsaresummarized

3 ABSORPTION DATA ANALYSIS
We study the distribution of neutral hydrogen around the galaxies
in our sample by analyzing the Ly 𝛼absorption signal. Instead of
fitting individual Ly 𝛼absorption lines associated with each galaxy,
a statistical approach is adopted. We stack the quasar spectra after
shifting them to the rest-frames of the corresponding foreground
galaxies. Here, we focus on the median-stacked Ly 𝛼absorption.
However, we verified that mean-stacked Ly 𝛼absorption produces
consistent conclusions. Spectral stacking is an efficient technique to
statistically study the CGM without having to go through rigorous
absorptionlineanalysissuchasidentification,deblending,andprofile
fittingofindividuallines.Thismethodhasbeensuccessfullyusedto
analyzeCGMabsorptionsignalsinpreviousstudies(seee.g.,Steidel
et al. 2010; Rakic et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2020;
Muzahid et al. 2021).
3.1 Analysis with rest-frame equivalent width
To obtain the stacked spectra, each normalized quasar spectrum is
shifted to the rest-frames of each of the foreground galaxies with
𝑏 <3pMpc.Themedianstackedspectrumisthengeneratedbycal-
culating the median flux in line-of-sight velocity bins of 40 km s−1.
We have verified that our results are insensitive to the bin size. We
have not applied any weighting for the stack, all the galaxy-quasar
(andhencehigherhalomassesandlargervirialradii), 𝑏/𝑅virvaluesdecrease
with redshift, leading to the observed anti-correlation.

Tobrieflysummarizeouranalysisprocedure:a)wefirstfitaglobal
continuum to each quasar spectrum and normalize the spectrum by
this continuum (see Section 2.3). b) For every foreground galaxy,
we select a region of ±1500 km s−1around the galaxy’s redshifted
Ly𝛼wavelength of the normalized spectrum of the corresponding
background quasar. c) We obtain the median normalized flux in
40km s−1wide velocity bins for a set of quasar-galaxy pairs. This
is referred to as the observed median stacked flux profile. d) Next,
a local pseudo-continuum is estimated and subtracted out from the
observed median stacked spectra to account for the suppression of
the overall continuum below unity due to uncorrelated absorbers.
The median flux within a LOS velocity window of ±2000 km s−1
for a stack of random redshifts is used to determine the pseudo-
continuum (see Section 4 for details). The offset of the observed
pseudo-continuumfromunityisaddedtothemedianstackedspectra
to obtain the continuum-subtracted median stacked spectra.
Finally, e) the Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟s are measured from direct integration of
this continuum subtracted median stacked spectra using LOS veloc-
ity windows of±300 km s−1(𝑊𝑟,300) and±500 km s−1(𝑊𝑟,500)
from the line center. These velocity windows are commonly used
in the literature. The errors on 𝑊𝑟measurements are obtained from
1000 bootstrap realizations of the galaxy sample3. We confirmed
that convergence is reached in bootstrap distribution for ≳200real-
izations.
3.2 Analysis with pixel optical depth
Owing to the large dynamic range compared to the normalized flux,
the pixel optical depth ( 𝜏) is another useful quantity that has been
usedtostudytheconnectionsbetweengalaxiesandgasaroundthem
(e.g.,Rakicetal.2012;Turneretal.2014).Weobtainedpixeloptical

𝜏=−ln(𝐹) (1)
We set a flag value of 𝜏=10−6for𝐹 > 1. For heavily saturated
pixelswith𝐹≤0or𝐹 <Δ𝐹whereΔ𝐹istheerrorinflux,wesetthe
flagvalueto 𝜏=104.Theflagvaluesarechosenarbitrarilysmalland

to our analysis with flux stacking, we masked the aforementioned
spectral regions before obtaining the optical depths.
Toproduce2Dopticaldepthmaps,westacktheLy 𝛼opticaldepth
of the absorption associated with galaxies in bins of impact param-
eter (transverse distance from galaxies) the same way we do as flux
stacking. Instead of integrating the median stacked flux profile over
the LOS velocity to obtain rest-frame equivalent width, the median
optical depth is color-coded as a function of LOS Hubble distance
along the y-axis (by converting the LOS velocity to a distance as-
suming pure Hubble flow at the median redshift of the sample) and
transversedistancealongthex-axis.Theseopticaldepthplotsretain
information about Ly 𝛼absorption along the LOS direction along
with the transverse direction, thus providing insight into the aver-
age kinematics of Ly 𝛼absorption of a galaxy sample alongside the
absorption strength.

The red (blue) absorption profile in the left panel of Fig. 3 shows
the median (mean) stacked normalized flux for Ly 𝛼as a function of
LOS velocity for all galaxies in our sample. The pseudo-continua
of the mean and median stacked spectra are lower than the actual
continuum level, which is unity for individual normalized spectra.

arechosenfromauniformdistributionbetweenthelowestandhigh-
est galaxy redshifts in each quasar field. The number of random
redshifts is kept the same as the number of galaxies in each field.4
The average of median (mean) flux within LOS velocity of ±2000
km s−1is used as the median (mean) pseudo-continuum. The 68%
confidence intervals of the median/mean flux, shown by the grey-
shaded regions, are calculated from 1000 bootstrap realizations of
the complete sample.
The observed flux profiles are conventionally normalized by the
pseudo-continua before measuring the 𝑊𝑟s (see e.g., Steidel et al.
2010; Prochaska et al. 2013). Instead of normalizing by the pseudo-
continuum,weintegratetheobservedmedianstackedfluxspectrum
overthevelocitywindowof ±300 km s−1(±500 km s−1)andsubtract
out the contribution stemming from the pseudo-continuum within
the same velocity window to obtain the 𝑊𝑟s. This ensures that the
𝑊𝑟values do not depend on the pseudo-continuum level, which is
determined by stochastic absorption. We found that due to the small
valuesoffluxdecrement,owingtothelowerdensityofthelow- 𝑧Ly𝛼
forest, the conventional choice of continuum normalization and our
adoptedchoiceofcontinuumsubtractionproduceconsistentresults.

We have a large dynamic range in stellar mass for our galaxy
sample.Empiricalstudiesatlowredshiftaswellastheoreticalmodels
have shown that the halo mass, as well as the halo size, increases
with the stellar mass of galaxy. We, therefore, generated stacked
Ly𝛼equivalent width profiles as a function of normalized impact
parameter (𝑏/𝑅vir; see the right panel of Fig. 4). Instead of dividing
the whole𝑏/𝑅virrange in logarithmic bins, we created 3 bins for
𝑏/𝑅vir<1with roughly equal number of galaxies in each, and
divided the remaining 𝑏/𝑅virrange (upto 25 𝑅vir) in 4 logarithmic
bins.Themedianstellarmassofeachbinareindicatedinthelegends.
The median Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟shows a monotonic decline with both the
impact parameter and normalized impact parameter. We find that a
single power-law can adequately describe the data points. The best-
fitting power-law relations are:
𝑊𝑟,500=(0.117±0.005)Å×(b/400 pkpc)−0.75±0.04
𝑊𝑟,300=(0.106±0.004)Å×(b/400 pkpc)−0.79±0.03(2)
and
𝑊𝑟,500=(0.26±0.01)Å×(b/Rvir)−0.75±0.04
𝑊𝑟,300=(0.25±0.01)Å×(b/Rvir)−0.80±0.03.(3)
A fixed pivot near the middle of the impact parameter distribution
at 400 pkpc is used for the 𝑊𝑟-profile as a function of the impact
parametertoreducethecorrelationoferrorsinslopeandnormaliza-
tion. No such pivot is needed for the normalized impact parameter
because log10(b/Rvir)=0is near the middle of the 𝑏/𝑅virdistribu-
tion.NotethatthepowerlawindicesinEq.2andEq.3areconsistent
witheachotherwithin1 𝜎,andthatanexcessLy 𝛼absorptionaround
galaxy redshifts is detected with >99%confidence interval out to
≈2pMpc (or equivalently ≈15𝑅vir) in the transverse direction.
Although a single power-law can adequately explain the 𝑊𝑟-
profile, it is to be noted that the second point in the left panel of
Fig. 4 is barely consistent with the model. In Section 5.1 we revisit
the𝑊𝑟-profile for the full sample where we explored the possibility
of a power-law + log-linear (or Gaussian) model for the profile. All
the measurements related to the 𝑊𝑟-profiles presented in this work
are given as "online only" tables (see Appendix B).
4.1.1 Variation with redshift
The galaxies contributing to the Ly 𝛼stack span a redshift range of
0.01−0.48, corresponding to≈5Gyr of cosmic time. Since this is
almost 35% of the age of the universe, it is interesting to investigate
whether the Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟,500-profile evolves with time.
Fig. 5 shows the redshift evolution of the median Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟,500-
profile. First, we split the galaxy sample into three tertiles of the
redshiftdistribution,indicatedbytheblue(low- 𝑧,median𝑧=0.05),
black (intermediate- 𝑧, median𝑧=0.12), and red (high- 𝑧, median
𝑧=0.18) colors. Each subsample is then further divided into 4 bins
of impact parameters and normalized impact parameters. The first
two normalized impact parameter bins are within the virial radius
with roughly equal number of galaxies in each. The last two bins
outsidethevirialradiusarelogarithmicwithabinsizeof1.0dex,0.8
dex,and0.7dexforthelow-,intermediate-,andhigh-massgalaxies,
respectively (see the left panel of Fig. 5). For the impact parameter,
the first bin extends to 100 pkpc. The rest of the impact parameterrange is divided into 4 logarithmic bins with a bin size of ≈0.5 dex
for all three mass bins (right panel of Fig. 5). The median 𝑊𝑟,500
measured from the stacked spectra are plotted against the median
values for𝑏/𝑅virand𝑏in each bin. Median stellar masses of each
bin are listed in the legends below the plot.
In the left panel of Fig 5, the low- 𝑧points appear to lie beneath
the intermediate- and high- 𝑧points for𝑏 < 𝑅 vir. This trend is re-
versedfor𝑏/𝑅vir>1,wherethelow- 𝑧pointsliewellabovetheother

with the𝑊𝑟,500-profile for the low- 𝑧sample showing a shallower

ported by the best-fitting power-law relations indicated in the plots.

4.1.2 Variation with stellar mass
The galaxies in our sample span a large range in stellar mass. The
dependence of Ly 𝛼absorption strength on stellar mass at a given
(normalized) impact parameter can shed light on the structural vari-
ation and self-similarity of the CGM. In order to investigate the
possible mass dependence of the Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟,500-profile, we proceed
with a similar binning procedure as described in Section 4.1.1.
Fig. 6 shows the dependence of the Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟,500-profile on stel-
lar mass as a function of 𝑏/𝑅virand𝑏in the left and right pan-
els, respectively. The blue, black, and red colors represent, respec-
tively, the low- (median log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)=8.8), intermediate- (me-
dian log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)=9.8),andhigh-mass(median log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)
=10.5) galaxy samples. In the left panel of Fig. 6, the low-mass
pointsareconsistentlyabovetheintermediate-andhigh-masspoints
for𝑏 > 𝑅 vir, indicating stronger Ly 𝛼absorption around low-mass
galaxies outside the virial radii. However, no clear trend is seen
for𝑏 < 𝑅 vir. Overall, the Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟,500-profile is significantly shal-
lower for the low-mass sample (slope =−0.55±0.07) compared
to the intermediate-mass (slope =−0.77±0.07) and high-mass
(slope=−0.89±0.06) samples.
IntherightpanelofFig.6,thelow-massgalaxiesshowsuppressed
Ly𝛼absorptioncomparedtotheirhigh-andintermediate-masscoun-
terparts for a given impact parameter for the two inner-most bins.
However, no significant difference in 𝑊𝑟is seen among the three
different mass samples for 𝑏 >500kpc. Here we also notice a shal-
lower slope for the low-mass sample, but the power-law indices are
not as significantly different as in the left panel.
The presence of a strong correlation between 𝑧and𝑀∗in our
complete sample (Table 2) is reflected in the median redshifts of
the three mass bins. The redshifts in the legends show a general
trend that the median 𝑧is higher for the high mass subsample at a
given𝑏or𝑏/𝑅virbin(withtheexceptionofthesecond 𝑏and𝑏/𝑅vir
bin). However, by controlling the redshifts of the galaxy samples,
we confirmed that the trend of 𝑊𝑟,500with𝑀∗is not driven by the
underlying𝑧−𝑀∗correlation (see Section 5.3).

4.1.3 Variation with SFR
The SFR of a galaxy is intimately related to the availability of cool
gas in the ISM which is fuelled by the CGM. Star formation driven
outflowsexpelmetal-richgasfromgalaxiestotheCGMand/orIGM.
A fraction of the metal-enriched gas may be recycled back to thegalaxies aiding in further star formation. Therefore, connecting the
CGM properties and SFR is imperative to understand the role of
diffuse circumgalactic gas in galaxy evolution.

to compute the median). No galaxies with upper limits on SFR are
included in the high-SFR bin (median 10−0.4M⊙yr−1). Galaxies
in each SFR bin are further divided into two 𝑏or𝑏/𝑅virbins. For
𝑏/𝑅vir, the inner bin contains galaxies with 𝑏/𝑅vir<1and the
MNRAS 000, 1–22 (2023)12 S. Dutta et al.
outer bin contains galaxies with 𝑏/𝑅vir≥1. For impact parameter
𝑏, we adopted a separating value corresponding to the 33 percentile
of the𝑏distribution (119 pkpc and 107 pkpc for low- and high-
SFR bin, respectively). In this way, the outer bin will have twice as
many galaxies as the inner bin. This binning strategy is adopted to
increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked spectra for galaxies
with large impact parameters for which the Ly 𝛼absorption signal is
intrinsically weak.

However, there is no clear difference in Ly 𝛼absorption between the
two SFR bins outside the virial radius (or at >100pkpc). Although
we have not explicitly controlled for redshift, the median redshift in

The suppression of Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟outside virial radius for the full sample

A similar analysis only for the MUSEQuBES galaxies is not car-
ried out in Section 4.1.1 & Section 4.1.2 owing to the inadequate
number of pairs.
4.1.4 Variation with sSFR
Most of the galaxies with SFR estimates in our sample are scattered
around the star-forming main sequence relation (see Fig. 1). The
sSFR is thus a better diagnostic of star formation activity which is
independent of stellar mass.
We investigate the dependence on sSFR by dividing the sample
into star-forming and passive subsamples using a threshold sSFR of
10−11yr−1. Each of these subsamples is again divided into two 𝑏
and𝑏/𝑅virbins following the same binning procedure as used in
Section 4.1.3. The left panel of Fig. 8 shows the median 𝑊𝑟,500-
profile for star-forming and passive galaxies with blue and red open
boxes, respectively, plotted against 𝑏/𝑅vir. The right panel of Fig 8

Nonetheless,nosignificantdifferenceisseenoutsidethevirialradius.
Similar to Fig. 7, the redshifts of star-forming and passive galaxies

Appendix B).
Withopenstarsoflightershades,weshowtheLy 𝛼𝑊𝑟,500-profiles

ies. Consistent with the full sample, a significantly stronger Ly 𝛼
absorption is observed for the star-forming galaxies for 𝑏 < 𝑅 vir.Moreover, only a marginal difference between the star-forming and
passive subsamples is seen outside the virial radius.
The enhanced Ly 𝛼absorption for the star-forming galaxies out-
side virial radius for the MUSEQuBES sample compared to the full
sample in Fig. 8 can be attributed to the smaller values of 𝑏/𝑅vir
and𝑏. The apparent inconsistency in results between the full and
MUSEQuBES samples of passive galaxies in the smallest impact
parameter bins of Fig. 8 is likely due to small number statistics.
Only6and7galaxiescontributetothestackforthepassiveMUSE-

the two normalized impact parameter bins). The 68% confidence

someMUSEQuBESbins(labelledwith ±0.00rangeintheTablesin
Appendix B).
4.2 Optical depth maps
Inordertoinspectthecorrelationbetweengalaxiesandcool,neutral
gas around them simultaneously along the transverse direction and
along the line of sight direction, we produced 2D median optical
depth maps following the procedure described in Section 3.2.
The map for the complete sample is shown in the right panel of
Fig. 3. The first LOS Hubble distance and impact parameter bin is
constructedwithin0.1pMpc.Next,thebinsizeis0.17dexand0.29

The LOS velocity around a galaxy is converted to LOS Hubble dis-

the𝑆/𝑁in each bin. The optical depth for the random region is
generatedfollowingthestrategydescribedinSection4.Themedian
optical depth of all pixels from the random redshift stack represents
the median random optical depth, which is set as the minimum of
the optical depth color scale in the map. A Gaussian filter with half
of the bin size is used to smooth the raw optical depth map.
The right panel of Fig. 3 reveals enhanced Ly 𝛼optical depth

infallingand/oroutflowinggasratherthanredshiftuncertainties(see
e.g., Rakic et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2020).
Next, we divided our sample into two stellar mass bins with
log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)=9.9as the separating value (i.e, the median stellar
mass of the full quasar-galaxy pair sample). The median redshifts
for the high- (median 1010.4M⊙) and low-mass (median 109.2M⊙)
galaxy subsamples are 0.145 and 0.088, respectively. However, we
didnotcontroltheredshiftdistributionhere,asthisreducesthenum-
ber of available pairs leading to insufficient 𝑆/𝑁. The OD maps for
the high- and low-mass galaxy samples are shown in the left and

dom region for the high- and low-mass galaxy samples are 10−2.34
and10−2.29, respectively. A common color scale is chosen for the
maps which runs from the minimum of these two. We saturate the

5 DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the main findings from Section 4.
5.1 Comparison of the Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟-profile with the literature
We found a monotonically decreasing trend of the median 𝑊𝑟(Ly𝛼)
with both impact parameter ( 𝑏) and normalized impact parameter
(𝑏/𝑅vir)(Fig.4).Suchatrendhasbeenreportedintheliteraturewith
individualLy 𝛼𝑊𝑟measurementsintheCGMoflow- 𝑧galaxies(see
e.g.,Prochaskaetal.2011;Borthakuretal.2015)orfrom 𝑊𝑟ofmean
stackedLy𝛼absorption(seee.g.,Liang&Chen2014).However,here
we reported the presence of excess cool, neutral gas surrounding
galaxies out to 2 pMpc, equivalently ≈15𝑅vir. A single power-law
withaslopeof≈−0.75canadequatelyrepresentthemedian-stacked
Ly𝛼equivalentwidthprofile(Eq.2&Eq.3).Thesingle-component
power-law index is in good agreement with Prochaska et al. (2011),
obtained from individual Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟measurements for sub- 𝐿∗and
dwarfgalaxiesatsimilarredshifts( 𝑧<0.48)for𝑏 <1pMpc.Using
an𝐹-test we confirmed that a two-component power-law model is
unnecessary.However,thisdoesnotnecessarilydiscardthepossible
presence of a secondary component other than a power-law.
Previously, Borthakur et al. (2016) combined individual Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟
measurements in the CGM of galaxies from the COS-Halos and
COS-GASS surveys and obtained a log-linear 𝑊𝑟,500-profile for
𝑏/𝑅vir≲2with a slope of 0.387±0.103. The power-law nature
ofthe𝑊𝑟,500−profileatlargedistanceslikelyarisesfromthegalaxy-
absorber correlation which is well described by a power-law (Tejos
et al. 2014). While going from smaller to larger impact parameters,
a transition from a dark matter halo dominated environment to theregime dominated by halo-halo clustering has been observed in the
gas surface density profile (see Zhu et al. 2014). Recently, Wilde
et al. (2023) used a Gaussian 1-halo term (arising from the CGM)
alongwithapower-law2-halocontribution(whichisessentiallythe
contribution due to galaxy-absorber clustering) to explain the ob-
served Ly𝛼covering fraction profile. The transition point between
the 1-halo and 2-halo terms is defined as the extent of the CGM in
their work.
Inordertolookforasimilartransitionregionbetween1-haloand
2-halocontributions,wefitalog-linearandaGaussianprofilealong
with the default power-law model to the observed 𝑊𝑟,500−profile
plotted against 𝑏/𝑅vir. The two models are as follows:
𝑊𝑟,500=10𝐴−𝜎(𝑏/𝑅vir)+𝛼(𝑏/𝑅vir)𝛽(4)
and,
𝑊𝑟,500=𝐴𝑒−(𝑏/𝑅vir
𝜎)2+𝛼(𝑏/𝑅vir)𝛽(5)
The left and right panels of Fig. 10 show the best-fit models with
Eq. 4 and Eq. 5, respectively. The parameters of the best-fit models
are summarized in Table 3. The slope for the log-linear relation we
obtainissomewhatsteeperthanfoundbyBorthakuretal.(2016)but

compared to either of the two-component models with a 𝑝-value of

function, contributes negligibly to the profile at 𝑏/𝑅vir≳1which
closely resembles the CGM-scale ( 𝑅CGM) in the recent study of
Wilde et al. (2023).
Using a single sightline (towards 3C 273), Morris et al. (1993)
found that Ly 𝛼absorbers indeed cluster around galaxies, but with a

ies. They also concluded that weak Ly 𝛼absorbers cluster weakly
around galaxies. Tejos et al. (2014) further showed that ≈50% of
weak Ly𝛼lines are correlated with galaxies at large transverse dis-
tances. The low column density Ly 𝛼absorbers can be attributed to
the gas present in filament-like structures. Consistent with this pic-
ture,Wakkeretal.(2015)foundatrendofincreasingLy 𝛼equivalent

Ly𝛼detection rate is≈80% within 500 pkpc of galaxy filament.
Recently, Bouma et al. (2021) studied the relation between Ly 𝛼ab-
sorbersandnearbygalaxyfilaments.Theyfoundanexcessincidence
rate (d𝑁/d𝑧) near filaments and a somewhat shallower slope for the
column density distribution function compared to the general popu-
lation of Ly𝛼absorbers at 𝑧≈0. They also noted that the strongest

outside the virial radii of galaxies can, in part, come from the CGM
of other galaxies (‘intra-halo’ gas) residing in the filaments. The
‘inter-halo’ gas tracing the underlying density fields of the filaments
can also contribute. The 𝑊𝑟,500−profile in our fit is dominated by a

The connection between Ly 𝛼absorbers and galaxies, over a scale
of>500ℎ−1kpc, is investigated by Davé et al. (1999) using hydro-
dynamical simulations. They obtained a power-law index of −0.71
forthe𝑊𝑟,500-profilearoundlowredshiftgalaxies,whichisingood
agreement with our single component power law fit. To investigate
the origin of the 𝑊𝑟,500−𝑏correlation in their simulations, they
determinedthepower-lawindexofthe 𝑊𝑟-profileforthediffusegas

power-lawindexandtheindexforthediffusegasphasewerefoundto
be statistically indistinguishable. Based on this finding, they argued
that the trend between 𝑊𝑟and impact parameter can arise from the
clustering of gas and galaxies over large-scales. In the next section,
we will examine whether the stacked Ly 𝛼profile can be explained
by the large-scale clustering of gas and galaxies.
5.2 The role of galaxy-absorber clustering
Thestackedspectralprofileforthecompletesampleismainlyshaped
by the velocity distribution of the Ly 𝛼absorbers with respect to
the host galaxies. If the width of the velocity distribution is mainly
determinedbytherandomredshifterrors,aGaussianisareasonable
choice to model the stacked profile. However, the left-top panel of
Fig. 11 shows that a single-component Gaussian cannot explain the
observed median stacked flux profile of Ly 𝛼absorption for the full
sample.TwodistinctGaussiancomponentswith 𝜎valuesof 114.9±
6.5and341.7±26.0 km s−1are required to adequately explain the
entireprofile.ThenarrowerandstrongerGaussiancomponentlikely
arises from the Ly 𝛼absorbers originating in galactic halos (CGM).
The origin of the shallow and wider Gaussian component, however,
can be more complex. It can arise from weak and broad individual
Ly𝛼absorption associated with galactic halos (i.e., so-called broad

Another possible origin is the narrow and loosely correlated Ly 𝛼
absorbers likely arising from the large-scale structures tracing the
same overdensities as the galaxies.
Thelarge-scaleclusteringbetweengalaxiesandLy 𝛼absorbershas
been characterized in the literature (see e.g., Chen et al. 2005; Tejos
etal.2014;Wildeetal.2021;Borthakur2022).Thegalaxy-absorber
two-point correlation function can be parameterized as:
𝜉(𝑏,𝑟∥)=𝑟
𝑟0𝛾
, (6)
where,𝑟0and𝛾are the scale-radius and power-law slope, respec-
tively. The 3D distance 𝑟=√︃
𝑏2+𝑟2
∥. The correlation function
𝜉(𝑏,𝑟∥)is essentially a measure of the excess number of absorbers
as compared to random regions, hence it can be written as
𝜉=𝑁obs−𝑁rand
𝑁rand; (7)
where,𝑁obsand𝑁randare the number of observed and random
absorbers at a given 𝑏and𝑟∥.
At large impact parameters of ∼1pMpc, the absorbing gas is
unlikelytoarisefromindividualgalactichalos.AsdiscussedinSec-
tion 5.1, the contributing absorbers most likely reside in large-scale
structures tracing the same overdensities as galaxies. At this length
scale, it may be safe to assume a similar distribution of absorption
strength for the uncorrelated Ly 𝛼absorbers and for those absorbers
which are correlated with the galaxies. The excess Ly 𝛼absorption
we see at large impact parameter can be interpreted as the increased
numberof absorbersaroundgalaxies duetoclustering,and notnec-
essarily because of increased strength. With this assumption, thetwo-pointcorrelationfunctioncanbedirectlyrelatedtotheobserved
median stacked flux.
The optical depth can be written as 𝜏=⟨𝑎⟩𝑁, where⟨𝑎⟩and𝑁
are the average strength and the number of contributing absorbers,
respectively.Forthemedianstack,themedianopticaldepthatagiven

is shown in the left-bottom panel of Fig. 11 with the red solid line.
The corner plot in the right panel of Fig. 11 shows the 1- and 2-
dimensional projections of the posterior distribution for the model
parameters.
The reduced- 𝜒2of1.9obtained for this fit is larger than the
reduced-𝜒2of0.6obtained for a double-component Gaussian fit.
However, a fit with this simple two-point correlation function pro-
vides a significant improvement compared to a single component
Gaussian fit (reduced- 𝜒2= 2.7). This indicates that the broad com-
ponentinthestackedprofileforlargeimpactparameterscanbepartly
explainedbyasimpletwo-pointcorrelationfunctionarisingfromthe
large-scale clustering between galaxies and Ly 𝛼absorbers.
At this point, we emphasize that previous studies on clustering
analyses measured the 𝑟0and𝛾from the correlation function pro-
jected along the line of sight, thus eliminating the effect of redshift
space distortions. The correlation length-scale and power-law index
obtained in our analysis however suffer from redshift space distor-
tions since the two-point correlation function is not projected along
the line of sight. The evidence for redshift space distortion is also
clear from the optical depth maps (see Figs. 3 & 9). The correla-
tion length of 7.6pMpc found in this work is considerably larger
compared to the projected galaxy – H iabsorber correlation length
of𝑟0=1.6ℎ−1
70Mpc found by Tejos et al. (2014). This is also true
even when we compare the 𝑟0by fixing𝛾=−1.44as reported in
Tejos et al. (2014)). Recently, Wilde et al. (2021) presented pro-
jected correlation lengths of 3.4ℎ−1
68Mpc and 6.2ℎ−1
68Mpc for high
(𝑀∗>109.9M⊙) and low (𝑀∗<109.2M⊙) mass galaxies at low
redshift. The power-law index for the projected correlation function
variesfrom−1.2to−1.9forlow-tohigh-massgalaxiesintheirwork.
Nonetheless, this exercise demonstrates that the presence of the sig-
nificant non-Gaussian wings in the median stack can be interpreted
as a consequence of weak, correlated absorbers likely arising from

Muzahid et al. (2021) for a homogeneous sample of 𝑧≈3galaxies.
Moreover, we obtained a consistent result when we considered the

5.3 The role of stellar mass
The observed 𝑊𝑟,500-profile is shallower for the low-mass galaxies
than for their high-mass counterpart (see Fig. 6). This owes to the
fact that the high-mass galaxies show stronger Ly 𝛼absorption in
theinnerregions( 𝑏 <0.5𝑅vir)whereasthelow-massgalaxysample

In the left panel of Fig 13, we show the Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟measurements
for three mass bins within and outside the virial radius. We first di-
vided the galaxy sample into two bins with 𝑏/𝑅vir>1and≤1.
Galaxies in each 𝑏/𝑅virbin are split by log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)<9,>10,
and9<log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)<10. In each normalized impact parame-
ter bin, we now controlled the redshifts of the galaxies so that the
redshiftdistributionsofthelow-,intermediate-,andhigh-masssam-
ples are similar.6The median log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)and median redshifts
of different bins are tabulated in Appendix Table S11. Outside the

compared to the intermediate- and high-mass bins. Inside the virial
radius, we notice a decline in 𝑊𝑟for the high-mass bin compared

inside the virial radius are plotted with small offsets in the abscissa

bols. Similar to Fig. 7, the enhanced Ly 𝛼absorption outside virial
radius for MUSEQuBES galaxies compared to the full sample can
be attributed to a lower median 𝑏/𝑅vircompared to the full sample.
The trend for the MUSEQuBES galaxies is consistent with the full
sample, although not significant due to a smaller sample size.
The presence of significant Ly 𝛼absorption outside the virial ra-
dius can arise from the extended CGM and/or the large-scale struc-

can be traced by Ly 𝛼, is mainly residing in filamentary structures
around galaxies. Moreover, the geometry of such cosmic filaments
is much more widespread (up to 4 𝑅vir) for low-mass halos as com-
pared to high-mass halos (see their figure 1), leading to higher gas

et al. (2017) reported the presence of Ly 𝛼absorption well beyond
the virial radius of dwarf galaxies. Recently, the observations of
Wilde et al. (2021) also showed that the Ly 𝛼covering fraction re-
mains roughly constant at ≈40%out to 1pMpc from galaxies with

A possible reason for the enhanced Ly 𝛼absorption outside the

mass dependence cannot be directly attributed to the environment.
However,ifasignificantfractionoftheselow-massgalaxiesissatel-
lite, then their 𝑅virmeasurements can be underestimated. This can
leadtotheapparentexcess‘outside’thevirialradiusofthelow-mass
galaxies. Indeed, the convergence of the 𝑊𝑟,500profile for the three

The underlying gas distribution in cosmic filaments can explain

galaxies compared to high-mass galaxies when plotted against the
normalized impact parameter. At a similar normalized impact pa-
rameter,massivegalaxiestracearegionfurtherawayinthefilament

against normalized impact parameter. However, the underlying gas

ilarabsorptionforbothlow-andhigh-massgalaxiesatlargephysical
distances, consistent with our observation. In section 5.1, we sug-
gested that the power-law 2-halo term outside the virial radius can
account for the gas in the filaments of ‘inter-halo’ origin as well.
A marginal suppression in the Ly 𝛼absorption inside the virial
radius for high-mass galaxies compared to the low-/intermediate-
mass bin is observed when the redshift is controlled. To further
explorethiswithlargergalaxysamples,weselectedallgalaxieswith

Ly𝛼stacks. The lower cut in 𝑏/𝑅viris motivated by the lack of low-

this roughly brings the 𝑏/𝑅virdistributions of the three mass bins
on a similar footing. Although we did not explicitly control for the

(this is also true for the 68% ranges).
The right panel of Fig. 13 shows the median Ly 𝛼 𝑊𝑟,500as a
function of stellar mass (top axis) and halo mass (bottom axis).
To convert the stellar masses to halo masses, we used the sub-halo
abundance matching relation of Moster et al. (2013). The median

to the intermediate mass bin but is comparable to the low-mass bin.

The Ly𝛼𝑊𝑟,500measured for galaxy clusters is significantly lower
compared to the 𝑊𝑟,500we obtained for the highest mass bin of our
sample.
The dotted red line in the plot (right y-axis) shows the star-
formation efficiency (SFE) as a function of halo mass. The SFE is
definedas SFE≡𝑀∗/𝑀baryon=𝑀∗/(𝑀halo∗𝑓𝑏),where𝑓𝑏(≡Ωb

is the mean cosmic baryon fraction. As mentioned earlier, we used

AlthoughtheconnectionoftheLy 𝛼-bearinggaswiththeSFEisnot

findings.

sample of Milky Way-type galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation,
Ramesh et al. (2022) reported that the CGM of high mass galaxies
exhibitslessH igascomparedtolow-massgalaxies.Theyattributed
this effect to the kinetic mode feedback by SMBH residing in more
massive galaxies which can be responsible for sweeping up of the
cool gas in the CGM. This is consistent with our observations.
In passing, we note that our results contrast with Bordoloi et al.
(2018),whoreportedapositivetrendbetweenLy 𝛼𝑊𝑟and𝑀∗using
asampleof85galaxieswith 𝑏 <160kpcand 8≤log10(𝑀∗/M⊙)≤
11.6. This apparent disagreement may be due to their small sample
size, and the fact that they did not take into account the upper limits
in their analysis.
5.4 The role of SFR
Using a subsample of galaxies with SFR estimates, we studied the
impact of SFR and sSFR on the distribution of cool, neutral gas in
andaroundgalaxies.TheleftpanelofFig.7showsaclearindication
ofenhancedLy 𝛼absorptionwithinthevirialradiusforgalaxieswith
high SFR. However, outside the virial radius, no dependence on the
SFRisseen.Similarly,intherightpanel,astrongSFRdependenceis
seenonlywithin100pkpc.Althoughwedidnotexplicitlycontrolthe
redshifts in this analysis, the median redshifts of the compared bins
are very similar. The measurements obtained for only the MUSE-
QuBES galaxies (shown with green and magenta points) are also
consistent with the complete sample.
No statistically significant trend is reported between Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟and
SFR for the galaxies in the COS-Halos survey (Thom et al. 2012;
Tumlinson et al. 2013). In fact, Thom et al. (2012) argued that the
CGM of passive galaxies is equally rich in H i. However, Borthakur
et al. (2015, COS-GASS survey), found a marginal correlation of
individual Ly 𝛼absorption strength with SFR using 45 low-redshift
galaxies,withthemajorityofthesightlinespassingwithinthevirial
radius of the galaxies. Combining the observations of the COS-
HALOSsurveyalongwithCOS-GASS,Borthakuretal.(2016)found
a stronger correlation between SFR and impact parameter-corrected

width and that predicted by the best-fit model for the 𝑊𝑟-profile for
theentiresample.Theircombinedsampleisalsolimitedtosightlines
within≈1.4𝑅vir. This is consistent with the results of our analysis
using spectral stacking. A similar trend is also seen for 𝑧≈3.3
Ly𝛼emitters (LAEs; see Muzahid et al. 2021). However, the LAE
sightlines probe the CGM at 𝑏 > 𝑅 vir, where we did not see any
trend with SFR.
The trend between Ly 𝛼absorption around galaxies and SFR can
arise from the two following scenarios. First, star-formation driven
outflows can entrain and deposit cool gas in the CGM. We recall
thatthestrongSFRdependenceisonlyseenforimpactparameters ≲
100pkpc.ThegastracedbyLy 𝛼atlargegalactocentricdistancesdoes
notshowanydependenceonSFR.Thissuggeststhatinthisscenario
the outflows are only effective in determining the gas distribution
out to≈100pkpc. Second, the availability of more cool gas in
the CGM can lead to higher SFRs in galaxies. Although it is not
straightforwardtorelatethegasintheCGMtostar-formationactivity
insidegalaxies(sincethegasintheCGMhastogothroughdifferent
physicalprocessesviawhichitcancoolandbecomemolecularbefore
forming stars), the second scenario is predicted by simulations (see
e.g., Davies et al. 2019, 2020).
Finally, we note that the median stellar mass of the high-SFR
bin is higher than for the low-SFR bin. This is not surprising since
the majority of the galaxies in our sample follow the main sequence
relation(seeFig.1).However,theobservedtrendwithSFRisunlikely
due to the difference in stellar masses for the two SFR bins, since a
similar trend is also seen for sSFR, and again only within the virial
radius(seetheleftpanelofFig.8).ThefactthatweseeenhancedLy 𝛼
absorptioninsidethevirialradiusforstar-forminggalaxiescompared
to quenched galaxies (sSFR <10−11yr−1) is consistent with the
findings of Johnson et al. (2015), who found an enhanced covering
fraction inside the virial radius of late-type galaxies compared to
early-type counterparts.
5.5 Implications of the optical depth maps
Weproduced2Dopticaldepth(OD)mapsforthecompletesampleas
well as for two sub-samples with high-mass and low-mass galaxies.
In the ideal case of an isotropic distribution of gas around galaxies,
circularly symmetric OD maps should be observed. The departure
fromcircularsymmetryinthemapsindicatesthepresenceofredshift
spacedistortions.Thisisclearfromtheenhancedopticaldepthalong

However,atlargerimpactparameters,thiseffectislesspronounced.
Suchadistortionalongthelineofsightdirectionisalsoobservedby
Tejos et al. (2014). They found that the extent of the distortion was
consistent with the redshift uncertainty of their galaxy sample. We
observedtheexcessODupto ≳1pMpcLOSHubbledistanceforthe
lowest impact parameter bin. Considering a redshift uncertainty of
≈50 km s−1forourgalaxysample,thelengthscaleofthedistortion
would be∼0.7pMpc at the median redshift of 𝑧=0.1. Hence, the
observedelongationoftheODmapalongtheLOSdirectionunlikely
tobeentirelyduetoredshiftuncertaintyofourgalaxysample.Turner
etal.(2014)reportedasimilarredshiftspacedistortionforasample
of LBGs at𝑧≈2.3. Comparing with the eaglesimulation, Turner
et al. (2017) argued that infalling gas is responsible for the redshift
spacedistortion.Asimilarcomparisonofourobservedopticaldepth
mapswithsimulationscouldshedlightonthegaskinematicsaround
low-redshift galaxies.
The strong excess Ly 𝛼absorption within≈100pkpc transverse
and≈1pMpc LOS Hubble distance around high-mass galaxies is
consistentwithouranalysisofthe 𝑊𝑟-profile(rightpanelofFig.6).This is a possible indication of sightlines passing through denser,
coolgascloudsoriginatinginhigh-massgalaxiesfromgalacticpro-
cesses (e.g., extended galactic disk, clouds from galactic fountains).
An increasing strength of Ly 𝛼absorption with stellar mass (and
hence halo mass) in the vicinity of galaxies has been predicted by
simulations (see e.g., Rakic et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2017).
The OD maps are qualitatively in agreement with the maps pro-
ducedbyChenetal.(2020)forhigh-redshift( 𝑧≈2)galaxies.How-
ever, they find that the total optical depth in the redshifted region of
theopticaldepthmapislargerby >50%thanthatoftheblueshifted
side(for 70<𝑏(kpc)<150).ProducingtheODmapwithoutfold-
ing the negative and positive LOS velocities we confirmed that this
asymmetry is not pronounced in our case. The total optical depth in
theredshiftedregionisonly ≈7%highercomparedtotheblueshifted
region. The “least implausible” explanation for this asymmetry be-
tweenredshiftedandblueshiftedfluxaccordingtoChenetal.(2020)
was that the Ly 𝛼emission from galaxy halos contaminates the ab-
sorption features. This can be non-negligible if a foreground galaxy
is being probed by a background galaxy spectra, as was the case in
their study. However, our galaxy sample is probed by much brighter
background quasars, so this possible source of contamination can
be neglected for all practical purposes. The lack of any significant
asymmetry in the optical depth maps found in this work may be a
direct consequence of the aforementioned reason.
5.6 Possible caveats
Inthisstudy,wecombinedgalaxysamplesfromsixdifferentsurveys
fromtheliterature(non-IFS)alongwithourMUSEQuBESgalaxies
(IFS)leadingto5054QSO-galaxypairs.Whilesuchalargenumber
of quasar-galaxy pairs is critical to probe any difference in the Ly 𝛼
𝑊𝑟-profileasafunctionofgalaxyproperties,itinevitablyintroduces
heterogeneity in the galaxy sample. The different archival surveys
have different depths and spectroscopic completeness, and probe a
wide range of redshifts ( 𝑧≈0.01−0.48corresponding to 5 Gyr
of cosmic time). Further, surveys such as COS-Halos and Liang &
Chen (2014) were designed to study the CGM of ‘isolated’ galaxies
in contrast with the Keeney+18 survey which includes a substantial
fractionofgroupgalaxiesinit.NotethatbecauseofthelackofSFR
measurements, the Keeney+18 sample does not contribute to our
analysis of the SFR and sSFR dependence. Hence for the SFR and
sSFR dependence, the contributing galaxies are mostly ‘isolated’,
and environmental effects are not expected to be important.
Wetooktwomeasurestominimizetheeffectsoftheheterogeneous
galaxy sample: (1) Most of our analyses are based on the Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟-
profile as a function of impact parameter and normalized impact
parameter(𝑏/𝑅vir).Thisnaturallytakescareofthedifferentdistances
from the galaxy centre when the dependence on a given galaxy
parameter is investigated. (2) Whenever required, we controlled the
redshiftofthegalaxiesinagiven 𝑏and𝑏/𝑅virbin(seee.g.,Fig.13).
Finally, another form of bias can be introduced as a consequence
ofcorrelatedgalaxyproperties(e.g.,between 𝑧and𝑀∗andbetween
𝑀∗andSFR).Aspointedoutearlier,themergingofdifferentsamples
helps us to mitigate such intertwined correlations (see Fig. 1). We

6 SUMMARY
In this study, we used 4595 galaxies with median 𝑧of 0.1 (68%

profiles by means of spectral stacking. We report our findings based
on median stacks in this work, but we verified that the mean stack
produces consistent conclusions. The galaxies span a wide range
of stellar mass ( 109.1−1010.6M⊙), star formation rate ( 0.01−
1 M⊙yr−1), and impact parameter ( 0.5−2.5pMpc). The impact of
differentgalaxypropertiesontheLy 𝛼𝑊𝑟-profileisinvestigated.Our
key findings are:
•We find excess Ly 𝛼absorption around low- 𝑧galaxies out to a
projected distance of 2 pMpc or equivalently ≈15𝑅virand up to a
LOS velocity of≈±600 km s−1in 2D optical depth map and 𝑊𝑟-
profile. The Ly 𝛼𝑊𝑟-profile is well described by a single power-law
with a slope of≈−0.80. (Figs. 3 & 4).
•Thepower-lawindexofthe 𝑊𝑟-profileiscorrelatedwithstellar
mass, with a steeper slope for higher mass galaxies (Figs. 6 & 13).
The𝑊𝑟-profilesofdifferentmassbinsconvergeatlarge 𝑏butdiverge
at large𝑏/𝑅vir.
•Using an𝐹–test we found that a log-linear (or Gaussian) +
power-law model to the 𝑊𝑟,500-profile fits better than a single com-
ponent power-law. The log-linear (or Gaussian) component is only
prominent at 𝑏≲𝑅vir(Fig. 10). We interpret the small-scale and
power-law components as representing the 1- and 2-halo terms, re-
spectively.
•TheLy𝛼equivalentwidthwithin 0.25<𝑏/𝑅vir<2ofgalaxies
peaks at𝑀halo∼1011M⊙(𝑀∗∼109M⊙)). (Fig. 13).
•Based on a subsample of 442 galaxy-quasar pairs with SFR
measurements, we find Ly 𝛼absorption to be strongly correlated
with SFR and sSFR but only within the virial radius (Figs. 7 & 8).

APPENDIX A: BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE SAMPLES
FROM THE LITERATURE USED IN THIS STUDY
We carried out literature survey to increase the number of galaxies
for stacking. A brief summary of the CGM surveys from which the
galaxies are drawn is given below:
A1 Liang & Chen (2014)
The galaxy sample used in Liang & Chen (2014) is prepared by
cross-correlating public galaxy and QSO survey data. QSO infor-
mation was obtained from the HST archive, either COS or STIS.
Spectroscopicallyidentifiedgalaxiesweresearchedforinthefollow-
ing public surveys: Nearby Galaxy Catalog (NGC), SDSS, 2MASS,
2dFGRS. They used an impact parameter cut-off of 500 kpc, and
a LOS separation of at least 1000 km s−1from the QSO redshift
to avoid QSO proximity effects. We retrieve information about all
195 galaxies used in this work. The galaxies have a median redshift
of 0.041 and a wide range of stellar mass ranging from ≈105M⊙
to≈1011M⊙. The stellar masses are obtained from NASA-Sloan
catalog and the scaling relation between stellar mass and rest-frame
absolute𝑟−bandmagnitude.Asubsampleofgalaxieshavemeasured
star formation rates using rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes. Out
ofthe96QSOsusedtoprobethesegalaxies,13wereobservedusing
STIS. We obtain information about the other 83 QSOs which were
observed with COS G130M/G160M gratings from their Table 2.
A2 COS-Halos survey
The COS-Halos survey (Tumlinson et al. 2011, 2013; Werk et al.
2013) was designed to study gaseous halos around 44 low-redshift
(𝑧=0.15−0.35) galaxies with stellar masses of log10(M∗/M⊙)≈
9.5−11.5using 39 UV-bright background quasars with impact pa-
rameters ≲150kpc (𝑏/𝑅vir<0.8).
The spectroscopic redshifts for these galaxies are obtained us-
ing the LRIS spectrograph at Keck and the MagE spectrograph at
Magellan. The stellar masses are estimated from five-band SDSS
photometry using a template fitting approach implemented in the
kcorrrect code(Blanton&Roweis2017).TheSFRsofthesegalax-
ies are obtained from detected nebular emission lines, or limited by
their absence. The detected SFR of the galaxy sample ranges from
0.5M⊙yr−1to 19 M⊙yr−1(median 3.23 M⊙yr−1).
A3 COS-Dwarf survey
The COS-Dwarf survey by Bordoloi et al. (2014) primarily focused
on extending the COS-Halos survey to a lower stellar mass limit to
understandtheCGMarounddwarfgalaxies.TheCOS-Dwarfsurvey

on SDSS spectroscopic catalog. The stellar mass and SFR for the
43 selected galaxies were measured using SDSS photometry. The
galaxies used in this work lie within 150 kpc transverse distance
from UV bright background QSOs. We retrieve information about
all the 43 galaxies and quasars used in this work.
A4 COS-GASS survey
The COS-Gass survey (Borthakur et al. 2015) focused on the con-
nection between the CGM of low-redshift galaxies with the atomic
gas content in the ISM probed by the H i21cm line. The 45 galax-
ies used in this study were obtained from GALEX Arecibo SDSS

A5 Johnson et al. (2015)
The galaxy sample used in the study by Johnson et al. (2015) is
a combination of 11 galaxies from SDSS, 95 galaxies from their
own absorption-blind galaxy survey using the IMACS and LDSS3
spectrographs on the Magellan telescopes. The survey was carried
out in four fields, targeting 𝑧 < 0.4galaxies with 𝑟𝐴𝐵<23mag
and as far as Δ𝜃=10arcmin from the QSO. Information about all
of the 106 galaxies are included in our study. We obtain the spectra
of the 4 quasars in the 4 fields from the HST-COS archive. The
stellar mass of the galaxy sample is obtained from the g- and r-band
absolute magnitude (using multiband photometry and the kcorrect
tool).Thegalaxysamplespansastellarmassrangeoflog 10(𝑀∗/M⊙)

A6 Keeney et al. (2018)
The galaxy information in Keeney et al. (2018) is obtained from
the COS GTO Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Galaxy Group Sur-
vey. The COS GTO Galaxy Redshift Survey obtained redshifts of
galaxies with g <20 within 38 AGN sight lines, using the HYDRA
spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m telescope and the AA Ωspectro-
graph on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian telescope for the multi-object
spectroscopy.TheGalaxyGroupSurveywasdesignedtoobserve10
sightlines that probe SDSS selected galaxy groups, with a primary
focusonincreasingthenumberofspectroscopicallyidentifiedgroup
members to 𝑁≥20per group. Multi-object spectroscopy was per-
formed with WIYN/HYDRA and MMT/Hectospec. We discarded

sightlines. The galaxies have a wide range of stellar mass ranging
from∼105M⊙to∼1013M⊙(median 1010.1M⊙).Thestellarmass
of galaxies in this work is calculated from the galaxy’s rest-framei-band luminosity. The impact parameters range from ≈6kpc to
≈13Mpc with median impact parameter being 2.3 Mpc (median
𝑏/𝑅vir≈14).
