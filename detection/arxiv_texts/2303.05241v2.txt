Abstract. We compute the fundamental group of the Galois coverof a surfac e of degree 8, with
singularities of degree 4 whose degeneration is homeomorphic to a sp here. The group is shown
to be a metabelian group of order 223. The computation amalgamates local groups, classiﬁed
elsewhere, by an iterative combination of computational and group theoretic methods. Three
simpliﬁed surfaces, for which the fundamental group of the Galois c over is trivial, hint toward
complications that depend on the homotopy of the degenerated su rface.
1.Introduction
The classiﬁcation of algebraic surfaces is a classical problem in algebr aic geometry. The
fundamental group of the complement of a branch curve and the f undamental group of the
Galois cover of the surface, are important invariants of the surfa ce. Degeneration is a crucial
tool in classifying surfaces, leading to a presentation of these gro ups by generators and relations.
Some recent studies of degenerations and their structure appea r in [10, 11, 13].
Given a surface Xembedded in CPNfor someN, and a generic projection to CP2with a
branch curve S, the fundamental group G=π1(CP2−S) is an invariant of the degeneration
class ofX. The standard generators in the Van Kampen presentation of this group are denoted
byγ1,γ1′,...,γ q,γq′, whereqis the number of lines in the degenerated object. There is a natural
map from the quotient G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htto the symmetric group Sn, wheren= degXis the degree of the
projection and /an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htis the normal subgroup generated by γ2
1,γ2
1′,...,γ2

q′. The fundamental
group of the Galois cover XGalis the kernel of this map [14], so we have a short exact sequence
1−→π1(XGal)−→π1(CP2−S)//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht −→Sn−→1.
The presentation of group Gis fairly complicated and it is often a challenging task to
ascertain basic properties of this group. The computation has bee n carried out in many cases,
for example, for CP1×CP1[15], the Veronese surfaces [17, 18], Hirzebruch surfaces Fk(a,b) for

aandbrelatively prime [16], CP1×T[2, 9] where Tis the complex torus, toric varieties [7], and
surfaces with Zappatic singularities of type Ek[4]. In one of the most complex cases, that of the
surfaceT×T[8], the Van Kampen presentation had 54 generators and nearly 20 00 relations.
To the degeneration of a surface Xwe associate the shadow, which is a 2-dimensional
simplicial complex. There is one 2-cell (i.e., a triangle) for each irreduc ible component of the
degeneration, which are all copies of CP2. Two triangles share a 1-cell (an edge), respectively
a 0-cell (a vertex), if the corresponding planes intersect in a line, r espectively at a point. In
particular, the number of triangles in the shadow is the degree of X. Edges that belong to a
single triangle are redundant . The number of non-redundant edges meeting in a vertex is the
multiplicity (or the degree) of the singularity at this point. The shado w isplanarif it can be
embedded inthe Euclidean plane R2. Experience shows that thecomputationof thefundamental
group is typically easier when the shadow is planar.
Most examples studied so far have planar shadows [4, 7, 16, 17, 18]. Relatively new works
on surfaces of degrees 5 and 6, with planar shadows, appear in [5, 3 ]. Recently, the ﬁrst named
author studied surfaces with non-planar shadows that have degr ees 4 and 6, see [1]. The shadow
of the surface CP1×T(whereTis the torus), which was studied in [2], is homeomorphic to a
cylinder.
In this work we focus on surfaces of degree 8, whose shadow is hom eomorphic to the sphere
S2, such that every vertex in the shadow has degree 4. Such a shado w can be described as the
union of two triangulated squares glued along all four edges, see Fig ure 1; for that reason we
denote the shadow as X4. As expected, π1(X4
Gal) has rather complicated computations. We thus
implement the following technique: We introduce intermediate shadow s, obtained by “cutting
open” one glued pair of edges in each step. There are thus four sha dows,
X1→X2→X3→X4,
where each arrow denotes a covering map obtained from identifying two edges, see Figures 2, 3,
and 4, respectively. Computing the four fundamental groups in th is manner becomes a sequence
of problems of increasing complexity, each of which requires addition al ideas to solve. For i=
1,2,3, we were able to use Magmato simplify the presentation of π1(Xi
Gal), resulting in each case
in a trivial group. Singularities of high multiplicity complicate the comput ation, so for X4we
needed to incorporate the methods of [6] and [19].FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 3
For every graph Tthere are a Coxeter group C(T) and a natural quotient CY(T). This is
relevant here because in all cases computed so far, the fundamen tal group of the surface turns
out to be a quotient of CY(T), whereTis the dual graph of the shadow. Naively, we would want
to make all computations in CY(T), because this group is fully understood. However, not all the
deﬁning relations of CY(T) are given a priori. This is resolved by a technical innovation of a
multi-layered computation. We run Magmaon the given presentation. When we cannot show that
the fundamental group is indeed a quotient of CY(T), we show that a subgroup is a quotient of
CY(T′) for a subgraph T′, use this to obtain more relations, run Magmaagain, and repeat. This
is best demonstrated in the computation for X3below.
As we progress from X1toX2toX3and ﬁnally to X4, the situation becomes more complex.
ForX1the traditional techniques suﬃce. For X2we usedMagmaand methods from [19]. For
X3we used the multi-layered computation described above. For X4we needed to also combine
ideas from [6], which computes the Artin covers of CY(T).
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we giv e the constructions
ofXi,i= 1,2,3,4, we recall the Van Kampen Theorem to get presentations of fund amental
groups, and give some necessary details on Coxeter groups and du al graphs from the papers
[6] and [19]. In Theorems 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 (Section 3) the groups π1(XGal) related to Xi,
i= 1,2,3,4, are determined.
2.Preliminaries and methods
In this section we describe the shadows X1,X2,X3, andX4in detail, and apply standard
techniques to exhibit presentations for their fundamental group sπ1(Xi
Gal). We recommend [10,
11, 13] as sources for relevant information about degenerations and [3] for detailed background
about fundamental groups of complements of branch curves and fundamental groups of Galois
covers.
2.1.Projective degeneration. We begin by deﬁning a degeneration. Let ∆ denote the unit
disc, and let X,Ybe projective algebraic surfaces. Let p:Y→CP2andp′:X→CP2be generic
projections. We say that p′is a projective degeneration of pif there is a ﬂat family π:V→∆
and an embedding F:V→∆×CP2, such that Fcomposed with the ﬁrst projection is π, and:
(a)π−1(0)≃X;
(b) there is a t0/ne}ationslash= 0 in ∆ such that π−1(t0)≃Y;4 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
(c) the family V−π−1(0)→∆−0 is smooth;
(d) restricting to π−1(0),F= 0×p′under the identiﬁcation of π−1(0) withX;
(e) restricting to π−1(t0),F=t0×punder the identiﬁcation of π−1(t0) withY.
In the above process, we construct a ﬂat degeneration of Xinto a union of planes. We consider
degenerations with only two planes intersecting at a line, with each pla ne homeomorphic to CP2.
2.2.Constructions and ﬁgures of degenerations. Here we describe the four shadows Xi,
i= 1,2,3,4, which as explained above are all of degree 8 and have singularities o f degree at most
(and inX4: precisely) 4.
Construction 1 (The shadow X4).A triangulation of degree 8of the sphere is obtained by
cutting the Euclidean sphere by three orthogonal planes pas sing through the origin, see Figure 1.
This triangulation has 6vertices which we denote V1,...,V 6and12edges; the repeated edges,
5,6,8,9, are glued in pairs. We numerate the vertices and edges for fu ture reference.

It is worth noting that following [11, Corollary 12.2], each degree 4 deg eneration can be
deformed to a cone over an elliptic curve E0, whereE0is a curve of degree 4 in P3. The Zappatic
singularities of type E4are obtained as the intersection of 4 lines. For more details about su ch
surfaces, see [4].
Now consider the two connected components of Figure 1, without t he gluing. We will
constructX1,X2, andX3by gluing one pair, then two pairs, and eventually, three pairs of
edges.
Construction 2 (The shadow X1).The shadow X1appears in Figure 2. It has 8vertices and 15

the ﬁgure, and the two copies are of course glued.
Notice that the degree of V1andV2is4; the degree of V3andV4is3; and the other vertices
have degree 1.

2.3.Fundamental groups. We now describe how the fundamental groups for Xi,i= 1,2,3,4,
are computed from the diagrams. Let Xbe an algebraic surface of degree nembedded in some
projective space, with a generic projection f:X→CP2of degreen. Let
XGal=(X×CP2...×CP2X)−△,FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 7
be the Galois cover of X, where the product is taken ntimes, and △is the extended diagonal
that is deﬁned as
△={(x1,...,x k)∈Xk/vextendsingle/vextendsinglexi=xjfor somei/ne}ationslash=j}.
Theprojectionhasabranchcurve S, andweturntocompute G=π1(CP2−S)andπ1(XGal).
The degeneration of Xinto a union of planes has a branch curve which is a line arrangement of
degreeq, the number of edges in the degeneration.
Thevertices of the line arrangement are the points where more than two lines inte rsect.
The multiplicity of a vertex is the number of lines kthat intersect at the point. In this work,
we have singularities with multiplicities 1, 3, and 4. There is a regenerat ion process (explained,
for example, in [3]), which “opens” each of the lines to either a double lin e or a conic. We
obtain a local description for the regenerated curve S, which is a cuspidal curve of degree 2 q.
To compute the presentation we ﬁrst must choose a global orderin g of the edges in the shadow.
Then, the relations arising from each vertex depend on the local or dering at this point. Now,
the Van Kampen Theorem [20] states that group G=π1(CP2−S) is generated by γi,γi′for
i= 1,...,q, where each generator represents an edge between two planes in the degeneration,
subject to relations of the following ﬁve types.
(1) for every branch point of a conic, a relation of the form γ=γ′whereγ,γ′are certain
conjugates of the generators γjandγj′,
(2) for every node, [ γ,γ′] = 1 where γ,γ′are certain conjugates of γiandγj, wherei,jare
the lines meeting in this node,
(3) for every cusp, /an}bracketle{tγ,γ′/an}bracketri}ht= 1 whereγ,γ′are as in (2),
(4) the “projective relation”1/producttext
i=dγi′γi= 1,
(5*) a commutator relation for every pair of edges which meet in the branch curve.
As a consequence, other than the projective relation, the relatio ns can be computed locally.
In other words, Gis an amalgamated product of “local groups”, one for each vertex , generated
by the generators corresponding to the edges meeting in the vert ex — modulo the projective
relation of (4) and the relations of type (5*). The amalgamation is do ne by identifying the
generators associated to the same edge, each appearing in the tw o local groups of the vertices of
this edge.8 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
The following lemmas summarize the local groups for vertices of multip licity 3 or 4 after
regeneration, for a particular order of the edges. Our numeratio n of the edges in each of the
shadowsXiwas chosen so that locally we only see the orderings appearing in thes e lemmas.
In Figure 6 we have an intersection of three lines, being globally order ed asi<j <k .

2.4.The dual graph. GroupGcomes with a natural projection to the symmetric group Sn,
where each generator γiorγi′is mapped to the transposition switching the planes meeting in
edge number i.
From a presentation of Gwe can ﬁnd a presentation of π1(XGal), using the exact sequence
(18) 0 →π1(XGal)→G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht →Sn→0;
this can be done using the Reidmeister-Schreier method; however, the number of generators gets
multiplied by n!, so one must ﬁnd ways to make the computation manageable.
Consider a shadow, such as Xifori= 1,2,3,4. We now deﬁne a map from the fundamental
groupG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}httothesymmetric group Sn, wherenisthenumber of2-cellsintheshadow. Recall
thatG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htis generated by γiandγi′, one pair for each nonredundant edge of the shadow.
The map to Snis then deﬁned by mapping both γiandγi′to the transposition ( ab), wherea,b
are the triangles meeting in the common edge i.
A set of transpositions in Sncan be encoded as the edges of a graph Tonnvertices. The
transpositions generate the whole group if and only if Tis connected. Furthermore, Sncan be
presented on the given transpositions with respect to a certain se t of relations. Group CY(T),
which we deﬁne below, is deﬁned by imposing the “local” relations, and s o there is a projection
CY(T)→Sn. In all cases studied so far, it was possible to prove that the gener ators ofG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht
satisfy the deﬁning relations of CY(T).
Thedual graph of the shadow is graph T, whose vertices are the 2-cells, with an edge
connecting every intersecting pair of 2-cells. For example, the dua l graph ofX1(from Figure 2),
is given in Figure 10.
Because the product of two transpositions is of order 2 or 3, depe nding on whether they
intersect, we are led to associate to the dual graph Tan abstract group CY(T) deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 2.3. LetTbe a connected graph, not necessarily simple, but without lo ops. LetC(T)
be the Coxeter group whose generators are the edges of T, subject to three types of relations:
u2= 1for every generator; (uv)2= 1if the edges corresponding to u,vare disjoint; and (uv)3= 1
ifu,vintersect in one vertex. (No relation is assumed if u,vconnect the same two vertices).FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 11

Furthermore, we deﬁne the group CY(T)as the quotient of C(T)with respect to four types
of relations:
[wuw,v] =eifu,v,ware as in Figure 8 (left) , (19)
/an}bracketle{twuw,v/an}bracketri}ht=eifu,v,ware as in Figure 8 (right) , (20)

It is easy to see that if we mapeach generator tothe transposition , switching itstwo vertices,
all the relations deﬁning CY(T) hold inSn. We thus have a well-deﬁned projection CY(T)→Sn,
wherenis the number of vertices.
It is not hard to see that if Tis a tree, then CY(T) is isomorphic to Sn. In general, the
transpositions arranged in a cycle satisfy another relation, the “c yclic relation”, which does not
hold inCY(T). This was used to compute the kernel of the map CY(T)→Sn, as we now explain.
2.5.The group Sn⋉At,n.The kernel of the map CY(T)→Snwas computed in [19], when T
is a simple graph. For a planar graph T, this was extended in [6] to a similarly deﬁned group
AY(T), which naturally covers Artin’s braid group Bn; the kernel of the map AY(T)→Bnwas
computed there. From this result one can deduce the structure o f the kernel of CY(T)→Snfor
any planar graph T, simple or not. We believe that the same description holds for any gra ph
(see [12] for details), but this is not needed for the current paper .12 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
Lett≥0 andnbe natural numbers. Recall the deﬁnition of group At,nfrom [19]. Let
U:={u,u′,...}be a set consisting of telements.
Deﬁnition 2.4. GroupAt,nis generated by the n2|U|elementsux,y, foru∈Uandx,y∈
{1,...,n}, satisfying the following relations for any u,u′∈Uand anyx,y,z:
(1)ux,x=e
(2)ux,yuy,z=ux,z=uy,zux,y
(3) [ux,y,u′
w,z] =e(for distinct x,y,wandz)
Another description of the same group is provided by the following.
Deﬁnition 2.5. Forx∈ {1,...,n}, letF(x)denote the free group on tlettersux(u∈U). Put
F∗
t,n:=/producttext
x∈{1,...,n}F(x). Map ab :F(x)→Zt, deﬁned by ab (ux) =u, (where Ztis thought of as a
free Abelian group generated by U), can be extended naturally to give map F∗
t,n→Zt. We deﬁne
the kernel of this map to be Ft,n[19, Deﬁnition 5.6] .
The main result of [19] is that CY(T)∼=Sn⋉At,nwherenis the number of vertices in T
andtis the rank of π1(T). The symmetric group acts on At,n, by its action on the indices. It is
also veriﬁed in [19, Theorem 5.7] for n≥5, thatAt,n∼=Ft,n. In particular, there is a short exact
sequence
1−→Ft,n−→CY(T)−→Sn−→1.

Notation 1. A formula involving γi,i′is a shorthand for all the formulas that are obtained by
replacing this term with γiorγi′.
3.1.The surface X1.
Theorem 3.1. The fundamental group of the Galois cover of X1is trivial.
Proof.Let us describe group G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htfor the shadow X1depicted in Figure 2. The group is
generated by {γi}fori= 1,1′,2,2′,...,9,9′. VerticesV1andV2give relations as in Lemma 2.2,FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 13
where (i,j,k,l) are equal to (1 ,2,3,4) and (6,7,8,9), respectively. For the vertices V3andV4we
have the relations from Lemma 2.1, with ( i,j,k) equal to (2 ,5,7) and (4,5,6), respectively. The
verticesV5,V6,V7, andV8give the relations γi=γi′fori= 1,3,8, and 9 respectively. Then we
have the relations of type (5*):
[γi,i′,γj,j′] =efor (i,j)∈({1,3}×{5,6,7,8,9})∪({2}×{6,8,9})∪({4}×{7,8,9})∪({5}×{8,9}).
The last relation is the projective one1/producttext
i=9γi′γi=e.
Next we compare (14) and (15) with ( i,j,k,l) equal to (1 ,2,3,4), and together with γ1=γ1′
andγ3=γ3′, we getγ2=γ2′. Then we can get from (14) and (16) that γ4=γ4′. Similarly, we
use (i,j,k,l) equal to (6 ,7,8,9), along with γ8=γ8′andγ9=γ9′to getγ7=γ7′andγ6=γ6′as
well.
Now we turn to relation (2) and substitute i= 2 andj= 5 along with γ2=γ2′, which was
obtained before, to get γ5=γ5′. In a similar way, we substitute i= 4 andj= 5 andγ5=γ5′,
and getγ4=γ4′.
It follows that group G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htis generated by {γi}, 1≤i≤9. We now present the dual
graph of the edges in X1, see Figure 10, from which one can easily read the map G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht →S8
(where 8 is the number of vertices in the dual graph).

The relations that we have in G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht, from the above simpliﬁcation, are of type
[γi,γj] =e,if i,j are disjoint lines; (23)
/an}bracketle{tγi,γj/an}bracketri}ht=e,otherwise.14 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
We also have two relations γ1γ2γ1=γ3γ4γ3andγ6γ7γ6=γ8γ9γ8that relate to the two cycles
in the dual graph. Moreover, relations [ γ4,γ2γ5γ2] =eand [γ5,γ6γ7γ6] =eappear in our
presentation, and they are associated to the two sets of three lin es each meeting at a point in
the graph. This means that G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht →S8is an isomorphism, and since π1(X1
Gal) is the kernel
of this map, the fundamental group of the Galois cover of X1is trivial. /square
3.2.The surface X2.
Theorem 3.2. The fundamental group of the Galois cover related to X2is trivial.
Proof.The groupG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htis generated by {γi,γi′}fori= 1,...,10. Following Figure 3, vertices
V1,V2andV3give the relations from Lemma 2.2, where ( i,j,k,l) equal to (1 ,2,3,4) forV1, to
(4,5,6,7) forV2, and to (7,8,9,10) forV3. VerticesV4andV5give the relations from Lemma 2.1,
with (i,j,k) equal to (2 ,5,8) and (3,6,9), respectively. The vertices V6andV7give the relations
γi=γi′fori= 1 andi= 10, respectively. The relations of type (5*) are:
[γi,i′,γj,j′] =efor (i,j)∈({1}×{5,6,7,8,9,10})∪({2}×{6,7,9,10})∪({3}×{5,7,8,10})
∪({4}×{8,9,10})∪({5}×{9,10})∪({6}×{8,10}).
And as always, the projective relation is1/producttext
i=10γi′γi=e.
Nowwe explainthesimpliﬁcation ofthepresentation of G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht. Aswritten above, wehave
20 generators and a quite a few relations. We try a run of the prese ntation in Magmaand get as
an output a simpliﬁed presentation of G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htwith eight generators γ1,γ3′,γ5,γ5′,γ6′,γ7,γ9,γ10,
still with a long list of relations.
We construct the dual graph according to the list of generators, see Figure 11.

Figure 11. The dual graph after the ﬁrst run in MagmaFUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 15
We see in the output that there is a missing relation [ γ7,γ10] =e, which can be derived from
another relation [ γ1γ7γ6′γ3′γ6′γ1γ7,γ10] =ein the output. We then add it to the presentation,
and runMagmafor the second time.
The output of the second run on Magmaconsists ofγ1,γ2,γ3′,γ5′,γ6′,γ7,γ9,γ10, as generators,
again with a long list of relations. We pick up all relations of type (23) fr om the simpliﬁed
presentation, and construct the dual graph related to these ge nerators, see Figure 12.

In the output we could not ﬁnd the relation [ γ5′,γ6′] =e, but the relation [ γ6′γ3′γ6′,γ5′] =e
appearing in the output simpliﬁes to [ γ5′,γ6′] =e. At this point, a cyclic relation for the cycle
appearing in the graph, is still missing.
ForT, the graph depicted in Figure 12, we get a well-deﬁned surjection ϕ:CY(T)→
G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht, see Deﬁnition 2.3. This map sends the generator corresponding to an edgeEto the
generatorγi, whereiis the label on edge Ein Figure 12. It is well-deﬁned by the deﬁnition of
CY(T). By [19], the map ψ:CY(T)→S8⋉A1,8, deﬁned by
γ1/mapsto→(e d), γ2/mapsto→(e f), γ3′/mapsto→(c d), γ5′/mapsto→(a f)ua,f, γ6′/mapsto→(b c),
and
γ7/mapsto→(a b), γ9/mapsto→(b g), γ10/mapsto→(g h)
is an isomorphism. Here, S8acts on the label set L={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h }, andA1,8is generated
by the elements of the form ux,y(see Subsection 2.5), for x,y∈L. So, we are left to compute
kerϕ◦ψ−1. This is done by pulling back the deﬁning relations of GtoS8⋉A1,8, which gives us
a unique non-vanishing relation: uh,fug,d=e. However, we can act with S8on this relation, and
obtainux,y=u−1
x′,y′for any distinct x,y,x′,y′∈L. In particular, u2
a,b=uc,dud,e=uc,e=ua,b, so
ua,b= 1 and all the generators of A1,8are contained in ker ϕ◦ψ−1.
We thus proved that G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht∼=S8. In particular, the fundamental group of X2
Galis
trivial. /square16 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
3.3.The surface X3.
Theorem 3.3. The fundamental group of the Galois cover related to X3is trivial.
Proof.GroupG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htrelated toX3is generated by {γi}fori= 1,1′,2,2′,...,11,11′. Vertices
V1,V2,V3, andV4give the relations from Lemma 2.2, where ( i,j,k,l) are equal to (1 ,2,3,4)
forV1, (3,6,8,10) forV2, (4,5,6,7) forV3, and (7,9,10,11) forV4. VerticesV5andV6give the
relations from Lemma 2.1, with ( i,j,k) equals (2,5,9) and (1,8,11), respectively. The relations
of type (5*) are:
[γi,i′,γj,j′] =e
for
(i,j)∈({1}×{5,6,7,9,10})∪({2}×{6,7,8,10,11})∪({3}×{5,7,9,11})∪({4}×{9})
∪({4,5}×{8,10,11})∪({6}×{9,11})∪({8}×{7,9}),
and the projective relation is1/producttext
i=11γi′γi=e.
GroupG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htnow has 22 generators and a long list of relations. This input was fed in to
Magma, and the output is now the group with the generators γ1′,γ2′,γ5,γ5′,γ6′,γ7,γ8′,γ9, andγ10,
and a long list of relations. Let us label the triangles of X3, as in Figure 13.

The list of simpliﬁed relations we got from Magmacontains all the deﬁning relations of CY(T)
of a type (23) corresponding to Texcept/an}bracketle{tγ5,γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e,/an}bracketle{tγ5,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=e,/an}bracketle{tγ5′,γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e,/an}bracketle{tγ6′,γ10/an}bracketri}ht=eand
/an}bracketle{tγ7,γ10/an}bracketri}ht=e. It also contains the relations /an}bracketle{tγ6′γ7γ6′,γ5′/an}bracketri}ht=e,/an}bracketle{tγ6′γ5′γ8′γ6′,γ7γ10γ8′γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e, and
/an}bracketle{tγ6′γ8′γ7γ6′γ8′,γ1′γ5γ2′γ5γ1′/an}bracketri}ht=e, which can be simpliﬁed to /an}bracketle{tγ5′,γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e,/an}bracketle{tγ7,γ10/an}bracketri}ht=e, and
/an}bracketle{tγ5,γ7/an}bracketri}ht=erespectively. We thus obtained the relations of type (23) corresp onding toT, except
/an}bracketle{tγ5,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=eand/an}bracketle{tγ6′,γ10/an}bracketri}ht=e.
Denote by T′
0the subgraph of Tresulting by removing the edges labeled 6′, 9, and 5′,
and byT0the subgraph of Tresulting by removing the edges labeled 6′, 9, and 5. Since we
have derived the relations corresponding to T0andT′
0, we conclude that there are natural maps
CY(T0)→G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htandCY(T′
0)→G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht. Those maps agree on the generators that appear
in both groups, i.e., γ1′,γ2′,γ7,γ8′,γ10, and so we get a map from their amalgamated product.
Each of the graphs T0andT′
0has one cycle, so by [19], CY(T0) andCY(T′
0) are both isomorphic
toS6⋉A1,6by
γ1′/mapsto→(bc),γ2′/mapsto→(a b),γ5/mapsto→(a f)ua,f,γ5′/mapsto→(a f)u′
a,f,γ7/mapsto→(e f),γ8′/mapsto→(c d),γ10/mapsto→(d e).
Here,S6acts on the label set L={a,b,c,d,e,f }, the copy of A1,6corresponding to CY(T0) is
generated by the elements of the form ux,yforx,y∈L, and the copy of A1,6corresponding to
CY(T′
0) is generated by elements of the form u′
x,yforx,y∈L(see Subsection 2.5). Thus, their
amalgamatedproductisisomorphicto S6⋉(A1,6∗A1,6),whichwedenoteby H. Theresultingmap
toG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htis of course not surjective, so we take the free product with the m issing generators
to get the map
ϕ1:H∗/an}bracketle{tγ6′,γ9/an}bracketri}ht։G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht,
of which we need to ﬁnd the kernel after adding the remaining relatio ns.18 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
One of the relations in the output pulls back by ϕ1to
(a b c)γ6′(a b)(c d e)γ6′(a b c)(d e)γ6′(a b)(c d e)γ6′(a b d c)γ6′(a b)(c e d) =e.
Using the fact that γ6′commutes with all the permutations that ﬁx e, this relation simpliﬁes
to/an}bracketle{tγ6′,(de)/an}bracketri}ht=ewhich is the pullback (by ϕ1) of/an}bracketle{tγ6′,γ10/an}bracketri}ht=e, one of the missing relations of
type (23).
Adding edge 6′toT0andT′
0and performing the procedure described above by counting the
newly derived relation /an}bracketle{tγ6′,γ10/an}bracketri}ht=e, we get a map
ϕ2: (S7⋉(A1,7∗A1,7))∗/an}bracketle{tγ9/an}bracketri}ht։G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht.
Here,S7acts on the label set L={a,b,c,d,e,f,h }; one of the copies of A1,7is generated by the
elements of the form ux,yand the other by elements of the form u′
x,yforx,y∈L.

Next we consider the relation from the output that pulls back by ϕ2to

This implies that ux,y=efor all distinct xandy. In particular, γ5pulls back by ϕ2to

and since /an}bracketle{tγ7,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=eholds, we conclude that /an}bracketle{tγ5,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=eholds as well.FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 19
Moreover,γ5can be expressed as product of other generators. This means th at we have a
surjectionCY(ˆT)։G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}htwhereˆTis the subgraph of Tthat we get by removing edge 5. We
want to ﬁnd the kernel of this surjection.
As before,CY(ˆT) is isomorphic to S8⋉A1,8by

and

Pullingbacksomeofthedeﬁningrelationsof G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}httoCY(ˆT)andusingtheaboveisomorphism

The diﬀerence of (24) and (25) is u′
h,c=e, and after conjugating by elements of S8we get

w,z=efor allw,z. This implies that A1,8is contained in the kernel we are computing, and
thereforeG//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht∼=S8. This means that the fundamental group of the Galois cover relate d to

3.4.The surface X4.Finally, we consider a surface Xwhose degeneration is the shadow X4.
Recall that G=π1(CP2−S) is the fundamental group of the complement of the branch curve .
We let¯Gdenoteπ1(XGal) =G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht.

We want to verify that our group is a quotient of CY(T), whereTis given in Figure 17. First
we notice that the relations /an}bracketle{tγ2′,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=e,/an}bracketle{tγ5,γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e, [γ5,γ9] =eand [γ5′,γ9] =eare missing;
but these can be deduced using other relations from the output; f or example, we simpliﬁed
/an}bracketle{tγ2′γ5′γ2′,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=eto get/an}bracketle{tγ2′,γ9/an}bracketri}ht=e. Thereafter, we proved the following relations:
[γ1′γ2′γ1′,γ9] =e
[γ1′γ3′γ1′,γ8′] =e
/an}bracketle{tγ5′,γ2′γ5γ2′/an}bracketri}ht=e
/an}bracketle{tγ5′,γ7γ5γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e
/an}bracketle{tγ11′,γ7γ11γ7/an}bracketri}ht=e
/an}bracketle{tγ11′,γ8′γ11γ8′/an}bracketri}ht=e
[γ2′γ5′γ2′,γ7γ5γ7] =e
[γ8′γ11′γ8′,γ7γ11γ7] =e.
By that, we veriﬁed all the deﬁning relations (19)–(22), so our gro up is indeed a quotient of
CY(T).
LetFt,nbe the group deﬁned in Subsection 2.5. As explained in Subsection 2.4, CY(T)∼=
S8⋉F3,8. To compute G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht, it remains to cast all the relations in the language of the
generators of F3,8. Recall that F3,8is a subgroup of the direct product ( F3)8; letui,vi,wibe the22 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
generators of the ith component. So the free groups /an}bracketle{tui,vi,wi/an}bracketri}htcommute elementwise. In this
language,F3,8is generated by all the elements uju−1
i,vjv−1
iandwjw−1
i.
Based on the spanning subgraph T0that was obtained from Tby removing edges 5, 5′and
11′, the ﬁnal stage is to reinterpret the deﬁning relations of ¯G=G//an}bracketle{t/an}bracketle{tγ2/an}bracketri}ht/an}bracketri}ht, which we do by
mapping ¯Gto a quotient of S8⋉F3,8by
γ1′/mapsto→(bg), γ2′/mapsto→(bc), γ3′/mapsto→(gh), γ7/mapsto→(de), γ8′/mapsto→(fg), γ9/mapsto→(ab)
and
γ5/mapsto→(cd)ucu−1
d, γ5′/mapsto→(cd)vcv−1
d, γ11′/mapsto→(ef)wew−1
f.
As may be expected, most of the deﬁning relations of ¯Gnow become trivial. One exception
is the relation ω=e, where
(26) ω= [ud,vd][vc,wc]u−1
awav−1
bubw−1
bvbucwcw−1
du−1
dw−1
eu−1
ewfu−1
fugwguhw−1
h.
The other nontrivial relations are much nicer, and by acting with S8, we obtain the following
rules:
[ui,vi] = [uj,vj], (27)
[ui,wi] = [uj,wj], (28)
[vi,wi] = [vj,wj], (29)
(ui)2= (uj)2, (30)
(vi)2= (vj)2, (31)
(wi)2= (wj)2. (32)
LetC∗andC, respectively, denote the quotient of F∗
3,8andF3,8by the relations (27)–(32).
It is easier to compute in C∗: Write [u,v] for all [ui,vi], and likewise for [ u,w], [v,w], and the
squaresu2,v2,w2. We have that v2
i=v2
j=uiv2
ju−1
i=uiv2
iu−1
i= [u,v]2v2
i, so [u,v]2= 1, and
similarly, [u,w]2= [v,w]2= 1. Modulo the commutators [ u,v], [v,w], and [w,u], which are
central, the group is abelian.FUNDAMENTAL GROUP OF GALOIS COVERS OF SURFACES OF DEGREE 8 23

Here the group at the upper-left corner is generated by the co mmutator; the arrows so-marked
are the abelianization maps, and the middle row is induced by the short exact series

Again, by (30) and (32), this element is symmetric under the action o fS8on the indices, and
has order 2, so C//an}bracketle{tω/an}bracketri}hthas order 223. Recall that this is the group π1(X4
Gal), whose computation
is the main goal of this paper.
Recalling that the fundamental group of the complement of the bra nch curve is the semidi-
rect product of this group with S8, it is desirable to describe the S8-module structure of the
abelianization.
Remark 3.6. Considering all groups as S8-modules, the abelianization C∗/[C∗,C∗]is a direct
sum of three copies of the natural module V=Z8
2, namely /an}bracketle{tui/an}bracketri}ht,/an}bracketle{tvi/an}bracketri}ht, and/an}bracketle{twi/an}bracketri}ht.
For the sake of comparison, note that for p >2,Z8
pis a direct sum of two irreducible
submodules, Z8
p= (Z8
p)0⊕D, where the left component is the subspace of zero-sum vector s and
Dis the “diagonal” subspace, spanned by (1,...,1). On the other hand, for p= 2the irreducible24 AMRAM, GONG, ROY, SINICHKIN, AND VISHNE
modules are 0⊂D⊂V0⊂V, of dimensions 0<1<7<8overZ2, respectively. Now,
whileC∗/[C∗,C∗] =V⊕V⊕V, it follows from Corollary 3.5 that the abelianization of Cis
C/[C,C]∼=V0⊕V0⊕V0.
Finally,ωglues theuandwcopies ofDin this sum, so that the abelianization of π1(X4
Gal),
is
(C//an}bracketle{tω/an}bracketri}ht)/[C//an}bracketle{tω/an}bracketri}ht,C//an}bracketle{tω/an}bracketri}ht]∼=V0⊕(V0⊕V0)/D(1,1),
whereD(1,1)is the diagonal copy of Din the direct sum D⊕D⊂V0⊕V0.
