Abstract —In space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN),
receivers experience diverse interference from both the satellite
and terrestrial transmitters. The heterogeneous structure of
SAGIN poses challenges for traditional interference management
(IM) schemes to effectively mitigate interference. To address
this, a novel UA V-RIS-aided IM scheme is proposed for SAGIN,
where different types of channel state information (CSI) including
no CSI, instantaneous CSI, and delayed CSI, are considered.
According to the types of CSI, interference alignment, beam-
forming, and space-time precoding are designed at the satellite
and terrestrial transmitter side, and meanwhile, the UA V-RIS
is introduced for cooperating interference elimination process.
Additionally, the degrees of freedom (DoF) obtained by the
proposed IM scheme are discussed in depth when the number
of antennas on the satellite side is insufficient. Simulation results
show that the proposed IM scheme improves the system capacity
in different CSI scenarios, and the performance is better than
the existing IM benchmarks without UA V-RIS.

I. I NTRODUCTION
BEYOND the fifth-generation (B5G) and sixth-generation
(6G) cellular networks are expected to deliver unin-
terrupted connectivity and pervasive coverage. Consequently,
the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) emerges
and plays a critical role in enabling B5G and 6G [1]–[3].
SAGIN integrating satellites, drone networks, and cellular
communications, has garnered considerable attention in recent
years, owing to its potential to offer seamless connectivity
and pervasive coverage. However, the three-dimensional het-
erogeneous structure introduces more interference [4], [5]. If
the additional interference was not resolved, the integration
benefits would not be realized, or the performance was even
worse than that of separate networks [6].
For mitigating interference in SAGIN, the classical interfer-
ence alignment scheme (CIA) [7] as one kind of interference

in large dimensions and multi-user networks, where K/2sum
degrees of freedom (DoF) could be achieved for a K-user
interference channel (IC). Moreover, the CIA scheme was
further extended to fit the asymmetric channel strengths, where
a multi-layer IA scheme was proposed in [8]. Thereafter,
multi-cell and multi-user IA design was found in [9], and other
methods based on the IA were developed, such as opportunis-
tic interference alignment(OIA) [10] and interference steering
(IS) [11]. However, these IA designs [7]–[11] required current
channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), which was
infeasible in satellite communications due to feedback delay.
To make IA schemes available in real scenarios, the is-
sue of CSI latency was considered. In specific, the space-
time interference alignment (STIA) scheme was proposed and
developed in [12]–[14]. In [12], the IA scheme under the
assumption of completely delayed CSIT was proposed, which
achievedK
1/2+1/3+...+1/KDoF in the K-user multiple-input
single-output (MISO) broadcast channel. In [13], an STIA was
designed where it was shown that using partial delayed and
current CSIT achieved the same sum-DoF as that by using
completely current CSIT. Thereafter, the STIA was extended
to distributed networks such as the two-user IC and multiple-
user X channel in [14]. Notably, a more general STIA scheme
was designed in [15] for M×Nuser MISO X networks to
reduce restrictions on the number of transceiver antennas. In
the SAGIN network, since the time experienced by part of
nodes to obtain CSI was much greater than others, or the CSI
was unavailable, the CSI throughout the network was hybrid,
which posed challenges for traditional IA schemes. To address
this, the paper proposes a novel IM scheme that takes into
account the distinct CSIs of different nodes in SAGIN.
In addition to traditional IM schemes, the reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RIS) as an emerging technology has
shown promise in improving various aspects such as data
rates, reliability, and energy efficiency [16]–[18], as well as
enhancing interference management capabilities in terrestrial
networks [19]–[21]. Initially, for the scenario with Ksingle-
antenna transmitter and receiver pairs, it was demonstrated
in [19] that an active RIS with sufficient elements could ef-
fectively eliminate interference from cascaded channels when
there were no direct links among users. The research was then
extended to multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO)
networks in [20], where machine-learning methods were used
to find the interference zero space of direct and cascaded
channels, although the RIS could not be designed directly.
Subsequently, the exploration of RIS benefits extended to
multiuser MIMO networks with rank-deficient interferencearXiv:2305.05517v3  [cs.IT]  4 Aug 20232
channels in [21]. In this scenario, the design of each element
of the RIS was determined to achieve interference elimination.
After that, the focus shifted toward extending the application
of RIS to SAGIN. In [22], the active RIS was deployed in
SAGIN and the precoding matrix and reflecting coefficient
matrix were jointly optimized to minimize the transmit power.
However, this work only considered a simple model with one
single-antenna primary user and one single-antenna secondary
user and did not provide a solution to mitigate interference
from the dimensionality of interference space. Thus, the use of
RIS for SAGIN, which comprises multiple users with multiple
antennas, and achieving interference elimination is a pressing
issue.
To tackle this issue, this paper is the first work to design an
IA scheme for mitigating interference in SAGIN by assisting
a UA V-RIS. Through the joint precoding design of the satel-
lite, terrestrial terminals, and UA V-RIS, the proposed scheme
effectively manages interference even when some terminals
cannot acquire CSI or the latency of the CSI acquisition is
much greater than that of other terminals in SAGIN. In the
meantime, the DoF of the whole network is investigated with
varied number of transceivers. Overall, the main contributions
of our paper are as follows:
1)We investigate a UA V-RIS assisted SAGIN, which con-
sists of the satellite, UA V-RIS, and the D2D terminals. In this
system, UA V-RIS assists the interference elimination process.
In addition, the types of CSIs obtained by different terminals
are specifically distinguished as no CSI, instantaneous CSI,
and delayed CSI, making the proposed IA scheme more
general.
2)We design the first IM scheme that considers the types of
CSI on the satellite side. Specifically, when no CSI is acquired
by the satellite, the D2D transmitters adopt an interference
alignment scheme with the help of UA V-RIS to compress
the spatial dimension of the interference. When instantaneous
CSI is available on the satellite side, the satellite designs a
beamforming precoding matrix to avoid the influence on the
D2D receivers, and then the D2D transmitters utilize UA V-
RIS to further eliminate the remaining interference. When
delayed CSI is obtained by the satellite, the satellite and D2D
transmitters leverage spatial and temporal resources to achieve
joint precoding, where interference of the whole network is
mitigated effectively. In addition to designing the IM scheme,
the sum DoF of the whole network is analyzed when the
number of antennas on the satellite side is insufficient.
3)We investigate the impact of different CSI and network
configurations on the proposed scheme, thereby determining
the strategy of the scheme under different conditions to en-
sure optimal performance. Then, simulation results compare
the proposed IM scheme with benchmarks under the same
condition of CSI and network configurations, illustrating the
superiority of the proposed scheme.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section
II, the SAGIN is introduced along with the CSI latency
model and DoF definition. Section III presents three theorems
regarding the proposed IM with different CSIs. Subsequently,
in Sections IV , V , and VI, each theorem is proven, respectively.
The performance of the proposed scheme is then compared

to benchmarks under various types of CSIs and network
configurations in Section VII. Finally, the paper is concluded
in Section VIII.
II. S YSTEM MODEL
Consider the SAGIN consisting of one satellite s, one
satellite user c, and Kdpairs of device-to-device (D2D), where
D2D transmitter kt∈Dt={1, . . . , K t}matches D2D
receiver kr∈Dr={1, . . . , K r}, as illustrated in Fig. 1.
There is one UA V-RIS rfor assisting the D2D communication
process. Accordingly, the number of antennas of the satellite,
satellite user, D2D transmitter, and D2D receiver are defined
asMs,Nc,Mt, and Nr, respectively. The UA V carries an
active RIS with Lelements.
When the satellite and the ktth D2D transmitter transmit

where the channel from the satellite to the krth D2D receiver,

the channels from the ktth D2D transmitter to the krth
D2D receiver, Hkt,kr(t), from the UA V-RIS to the krth D2D
receiver, Hr,kr(t), and from the ktth D2D transmitter to the
UA V-RIS, Hkt,r(t), are subjected to Nakagami-m distribution.
It can be seen from (1) and (2) that both the satellite user and
thekrth D2D receiver are unavoidably affected by interference
from multiple sources. To eliminate the effects of interference,
the types of CSIs are distinguished by the CSI latency model
[24], and then a novel IM schemes are designed according to
different CSI types.
A. CSI Latency Model
We assume that the CSIs of all terminals are infinite
accuracy CSIs [24], which means the quantization error of
CSI does not affect the decision of the decoder. Then, we
discuss the relationship between CSI and latency. Herein, the
CSI latency model is introduced as shown in Fig. 2, where Tp,
Tf, and Tcdenote the past time, time delay, and coherence
time, respectively. Among them, Tpis the time elapsed before
transmission, and the CSI acquisition process can start at any
time within the coherent time slot. The definition of ratio λis
λ=Tf
Tc−Tp. (3)
According to the value of λ, CSI is determined within three
types as follows
•λ=0represents instantaneous CSI, where the transmitter
receives estimated CSI without delay. This is an upper

bound scenario, where transmitters can design precoding
matrices to eliminate interference of the current slot.
•When 0<λ< 1, two subcases should be considered. The
first subcase occurs when the obtained CSI is within the
interval of [Tp, Tp+Tf], which is equivalent to the case
of instantaneous CSI. The second subcase occurs when
the obtained CSI is within the interval of [Tp+Tf, Tc],
which is the case of moderately delayed CSI. In the latter
case, feedback delay exists but the channel matrix does
not change during the remaining time of the coherent
time. Thus, the transmitter can design a precoding matrix
with moderately delayed CSI to eliminate the interference
of the current slot.
•λ≥1represents delayed CSI which is an outdated
version. By the time the transmitter obtains CSI, the
channel matrix has already changed so that precoding
design cannot be made based on delayed CSI. Although
the interference of the current slot cannot be completely
eliminated with IA technique using delayed CSI, the fixed
properties of both the delayed CSI and the channel matrix
of past slots can be utilized. In other words, delayed CSI
is used for the precoding matrix design of the current slot
to eliminate the interference of the past slots.
B. Sum Degrees of Freedom
For the performance of the network, we mainly focus on
the system capacity, which is measured by the sum DoF. For
thekth user, its achievable rate is
Rk=fklog2(1+SNR ) +o(log2(SNR )), (4)
where o(·)is the indefinitely small quantity, SNR denotes
signal-to-noise ratio. fkdenotes the DoF of the kth user, whose
value can be expressed as
fk= lim
SNR→∞Rk
log2(1 +SNR ), (5)
which measures the channel capacity of a single cell per user,
i.e. the number of data streams that is transmitted reliably by
one user per slot. Then, we extend it to the whole network as
DoF =KX
k=1lim
SNR→∞Rk
log2(1 +SNR ). (6)
Since the condition SNR → ∞ holds, noise can be ignored
in the design of IM scheme.4

KdD2D pairs, each of which with Nantennas, Nc=Mt=

the satellite to terrestrial terminals. D2D transmitters, D2D
receivers, and the satellite user obtain instantaneous CSI from
the satellite to themselves, and they also obtain instantaneous

IV. T HEPROPOSED SCHEME FOR ACHIEVING THEOREM 1
Restricted by the inability of the satellite to obtain CSI,
i.e. no CSI, interference from the satellite to D2D receivers is
unavoidable. Therefore, we attempt to design a scheme where
part of the interference within the D2D network is aligned to
the interference space of the satellite network. The satellite
and all D2D receivers jointly design precoding matrices as
Hs,1Ws=H2,1W2,
...
Hs,Kr−1Ws=HKt,Kr−1WKt,
Hs,KrWs=H1,KrW1,(10)
where Wsis a unit matrix, implying that the satellite no
longer relies on CSI to design precoding matrix. In addition,
the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is applied
to all aligned matrices, e.g. the pre-coded channel matrix
Hkt,krWktbetween the ktth D2D transmitter to the desig-
nated krth D2D receiver is decomposed into
Hkt,krWkt=AkrΛkt,kr(Bkt)H, (11)
where Akr∈CN×NandBkt∈CN×Nare unitary matrices,
andΛkt,kris a non-negative rectangular diagonal matrix.For the ktth D2D transmitter and the krth D2D receiver, let

It can be seen that interference from satellites is integrated into
the designated interference space such that the spatial dimen-
sion of the interference is compressed. Then, we introduce
UA V-RIS to deal with remaining interference. The received
signal of the krth D2D receiver is changed to

Herein, the ultimate goal of the UA V-RIS is determined, i.e.
preserve useful signals while eliminating interference in (15)
and (18). Accordingly, the following conditions related to
UA V-RIS should hold
¯Hkt,kr+¯Gr,krΘ¯Fkt,r= 0,
¯Gr,krΘ¯Fkt+1,r= 0,
˜Hkt,c+¯Gr,cΘ¯Fkt,r= 0.(19)
To satisfy (19), we adjust the Θ∈CL×Las (20) which is
on the top of next page, where Hr∈C(Kd+1)N×KdN,¯G∈
C(Kd+1)N×Land¯F∈CL×KdNare the equivalence matrices
of the whole system. The specific value of each element in the
Θis determined by taking the vectorization operation [25] as
vec(¯Hi,j) =−(¯FT
i,r⊗¯Gr,j)vec(Θ)
=−(¯FT
i,r⊗¯Gr,j)βα,(21)
where i∈ {s,1, ..., K t}is one transmitter and j∈
{c,1, ..., K r}is one receiver. ¯Hi,j∈CN×N,¯FT
i,r∈CN×L
and¯Gr,j∈CN×Ldenote submatrix of the equivalence ma-
trices. (·)Tis the transpose operation and ⊗is the Kronecker
product. β∈CL2×Lis the sparse matrix for Θ, whose
element βq,pof the pth column and qth row is given by
βq,p=1
0q=pL−L+p
otherwise .(22)
As for the vector α∈CL×1, it determines the compensation
value of each antenna per received terminal, which eliminates
the effect of interference. We first set ¯Hr= (FT⊗G)βsuch
thatvec(Hr) =−¯Hrα. To make sure that each antenna per
received terminal can be regulated by an assigned element of
UA V-RIS, the condition must hold
L≥Kd(Kd−1)N2+KdN2≥K2
dN2. (23)
Under this condition, the Moore–Penrose inverse operation
[26] is taken as
α=−¯HH
r(¯Hr¯HH
r)−1vec(Hr). (24)
With the help of UA V-RIS, the channel matrix of the whole
system ¯His reshaped into (24) which is on the top of next
page. Herein, the received signals of the krth D2D receiver
and the satellite user are expressed as
ˆykr=p

respectively. To eliminate the remaining interference in (25),
thekrth D2D receiver has to sacrifice half of the received
antennas or utilize double resources of time slots. If more
time slots are taken, the satellite user has to keep silent to
avoid creating additional interference.
In summary, each of the D2D pairs and the satellite user
realizeN
2DoF within one slot. Thus, the sum DoF of thewhole system is
DoF =(Kd+ 1)N

Herein, the proof of Theorem 1is complete. ■
V. T HEPROPOSED SCHEME FOR ACHIEVING THEOREM 2
In this section, the assumption is made that the satellite has
sufficient antennas, Ms≥(Kd+ 1)N, and instantaneous CSI
or moderately delayed CSI is obtained by the satellite. Given
this condition, precoding matrices of the proposed scheme are
redesigned and the performance is evaluated with varying Ms.
Specifically, we first consider the network without UA V-RIS
and define channel the matrix from the satellite to the satellite
user and D2D receivers as
Hs=Hs,cHs,DkT, (28)
where Hs,c∈CN×(Kd+1)NandHs,Dk∈CKdN×(Kd+1)N
denote the channel matrix from the satellite to the satellite user
and all D2D receivers Dk, respectively. To avoid the impact
of the satellite network on the D2D network, the interference
are aligned to the zero space of Hs,Dkby precoding matrix
Wsas
Hs,DkWsxs=0. (29)
Since the matrix Hs,Dk∈CKdN×(Kd+1)Nis a row full rank
matrix, the underlying solution Ws,c∈C(Kd+1)N×Nmust
exist, thereby the homogeneous equations are designed as
Hs,1Ws,cx(1)

Hs,krWs,cx(kt)

ference is completely eliminated so that both the krth D2D

In summary, if the condition Ms≥(Kd+ 1)Nholds, each
of the D2D receivers realizes NDoF and the satellite user
realizes NDoF in one slot. Thus, the sum DoF of the whole
system is (Kd+ 1)N.
Remark 1 (the case that ψ < M s<(Kd+ 1)N):Based on
the above conclusion, we gradually decrease the number of Ms
and study how the Sum DoF changes. Specifically, if Ms=

at the satellite side, where the dimension of each submatrix
H(kt)
s,cis reduced by one. Then, if the number of Mskeeps
decreasing, the satellite has to sacrifice one DoF.
For the krth D2D receiver, since the antennas lost by the
satellite are gradually decreasing in integer multiples of N,
theNth,2Nth,...,(Kd+ 1)Nth antennas, we denote the
transmitted symbol of these antennas as xs,c. It can be seen
that the interference caused by the xs,ccannot be eliminated,
thereby bringing DoF loss. Since these antennas transmit
the same symbol, they can be equated to one-dimensional
interference, such that brings one DoF loss for the satellite
user but Kd+ 1 sum DoF loss for all D2D receivers. After
decreasing Kd+1antennas of the satellite, each D2D receiver
needs to silence one received antenna to compromise the
required number of Msfor eliminating interference. At this
time, the rank of Hs,Dkin (28) becomes (Kd+ 1)( N−1).
Accordingly, its zero-space dimension becomes N−1, which
means that each D2D receiver can avoid N−1terms of
satellite interference.
Overall, when the number of Mshas decreased Kd+ 1to
reach the critical point, and then one additional antenna of thesatellite is removed, Kd+ 1sum DoF will be lost at once on
top of the IM scheme. In this case, the sum DoF of the whole
system is given by
DoF = (Kd+ 1)N−KdN−Ms
Kd+ 1
(Kd+ 1). (46)
Simplifying (44), we get
DoF =Ms
Kd+ 1
(Kd+ 1). (47)
Remark 2 (the case that Ms≤ψ):For (46), it shows that the
sum DoF keeps decreasing as the number of satellite antennas
decreases. There is a critical point where the performance of
the IM scheme with moderately delayed CSI does not perform
as well as that of the IM scheme with no CSI. Herein, we
discuss the critical point regarding Ms. Specifically, when the
conditionMs

IM scheme with moderately delayed CSI is the better choice.

If the performance of the IM scheme with no CSI is the same
as that of the IM scheme with moderately delayed CSI, it is
more preferred due to the cost of CSI acquisition. To ensure
that the IM scheme with moderately delayed CSI is selected
only when it can achieve better performance, we transform

the proof of Theorem 2 is complete. ■
VI. T HEPROPOSED SCHEME FOR ACHIEVING THEOREM 3
After considering the best-case and worst-case scenarios for
the satellite acquisition of the CSI, a more realistic scenario
is discussed in this section. Since the satellite works in
frequency division duplex (FDD) mode, the CSI acquisition
at the satellite experiences three time delays, that is the pilot
transmission delay from the satellite to the satellite user and
all D2D receivers, feedback delay from the satellite user and
all D2D receivers to the satellite [27]. If the whole time delay
exceeds the coherence time, the satellite obtains the delayed
CSI. In this case, the precoding matrices of the proposed
scheme are adjusted and its performance is further discussed
with the different Ms.
Generally, we assume that the satellite has adequate anten-
nas,Ms≥(Kd+ 1)N. The proposed IM scheme consists
of3phases, where the first phase spans one slot, the 1st
slot; the second phase spans Kdslots, from the 2nd slot to
(Kd+1)th slot; and the third phase spans one slot, (Kd+2)th
slot. In the slot 1of the first phase, the satellite transmits
signal xs[1]∈C(Kd+1)N×1to the satellite user while D2D
transmitters keep silent. The received signal of the satellite
user and any D2D receiver is given by
yc[1] =p
PsHc,s[1]xs[1] (51)
and
ykr[1] =p
PsHs,kr[1]xs[1], (52)
respectively. Since the matrix Hs,c[1]∈CN×(Kd+1)Nis
underdetermined, the satellite user cannot achieve decoding
within the first slot. At this time, the delayed CSI of the D2D
receivers, Hs,1[1], ...,Hs,Kr[1], is obtained by the satellite and
meanwhile the received signal of kr,ykr[1], is fed back to the
D2D transmitter kt.
In any slot of the second phase, ∀t{2, ..., K d+1}, the signal
xs[t]∈CN×1transmitted from the satellite to the satellite user
is expressed as
xs[t] =p
PsXKt
kt=1\(t−1)Ws[t]Hs,kt[1]xs[1]
=p
PsWs[t]¯Hs[t]xs[1],(53)
where ¯Hs[t]∈CN×(Kd+1)N. The satellite user does not
decode the signal in this phase, so its decoding matrix is
Vc[t] =E, (54)
where E∈CN×Nis a unit matrix. Meanwhile, the (t−1)th
D2D transmitter and each of the remaining D2D transmitters
kt∈Dt\(t−1)respectively transmit signals

PsWt−1[t]Hs,t−1[1]xs[1] (55)

To ensure that the satellite user has access to more information
about xs[1], while aligning the interference of any D2D

˜Hkt,kr[t] +¯Gr,kr[t]Θ[t]¯Fkt,r[t] = 0.(63)
To satisfy (63), we adjust the Θ[t]∈CL×Las (65) which
is on the top of next page. The process of determining the
specific value of each element in Θ[t]is consistent with
theorems 2 and 3. After eliminating interference with UA V-
RIS, the received signal of the satellite user and D2D receiver
is changed to
ˆykr[t] =p
Ps˜Hs,kr[t](¯Hs[t] +Hs,t−1[t])xs[1]

and
ˆyc[t] =p
PsHs,c[t]¯Hs[t]xs[t], (67)
respectively.
In the third phase, each D2D transmitter transmits signal
Wkt[t]xkt[t−1]while the satellite keeps silent. The received
signal of krth D2D receiver is
ˆykr[t] =Vkr[t]Hkt,kr[t]Wkt[t]xkt[t−1], (68)
where t=Kd+ 2. Herein, the satellite user jointly decodes
the received signals within all previous slots as

(69)
where Hs,cis a(Kd+1)N×(Kd+1)Nfull rank matrix. The
received signals of any D2D receiver within all previous slots
are given by (71), which is on the top of next page. Besides,
both (69) and (71) can be decoded by the zero forcing method.
To summarize, each of the KdD2D receivers realizes
(Kd−1)NDoF and the Crealizes (Kd+ 1)NDoF within
the(Kd+ 2) slot. Thus, the sum DoF is given by
DoF =(K2
d+ 1)N
Kd+ 2. (72)
Remark 3 (the relationship betweenMs
Nand sum DoF): It
can be seen that the increasing Msbrings a positive gain to
sum DoF but there is a critical point that need to be discussed,
i.e. the performance of the IM scheme with delayed CSI is
inferior to that of the IM scheme with no CSI. We first assume
thatMs= (Kd+ 1)Nand then gradually reduce its number.
Specifically, if Ms= (Kd+1)N−1, the desired signal of thesatellite user in the first phase is changed to
xs[1] = [ xs,1, x s,2, ... , x s,(Kd+1)N−1]T, (73)
which means that one DoF is sacrificed. Fortunately, it does
not affect the dimension of ¯Hs[1]xs[1]such that there is no
loss on DoF in the second phase. The performance remains
stable until Nantennas at the satellite are removed. It leads
to the consequence that one D2D receiver cannot be served
so that the duration of the second phase is reduced by one
slot, causing the DoF loss. Therefore, we define φ=Ms
Nto
differentiate the number of D2D receivers that can be served.
For the satellite user and the krth D2D receiver, ⌈φ⌉+ 1slots
are taken to realize MsDoF and (⌈φ⌉ −1)(Kd−1)N. The
sum DoF is given by
DoF =Ms+ (⌈φ⌉ −1)(Kd−1)N
⌈φ⌉+ 1. (74)
Similar to the Theorem 2, there is a critical point where
the performance of the IM scheme with delayed CSI does
not perform as well as that of the IM scheme with no CSI.
Therefore, the condition
(Kd+ 1)N
2≤Ms+ (⌈φ⌉ −1)(Kd−1)N
⌈φ⌉+ 1(75)
must hold. Otherwise, adopting the IM scheme with no CSI
is preferred. Simplifying (75), we get
3Kd−1≤2φ+ (Kd−3)⌈φ⌉, (76)
Herein, the proof of Theorem 3is complete. ■
VII. N UMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, the paper investigates the DoF gain achieved
by the proposed UA V-RIS aided IM scheme in a specific
scenario with Kd= 6 andMs= (Kd+ 1)N. The impact
of varying values of KdandNon the performance of the
proposed scheme is also analyzed. Furthermore, the paper
discusses the performance of the proposed scheme when the
number of satellite antennas Msis insufficient. To provide a
basis for comparison, three benchmark schemes with different
types of CSI are introduced:
•Benchmark with no CSIT: This benchmark, referenced
from [28], represents the outer bound of DoF considering
various transceiver antenna ratios. However, when the
transceiver antenna ratio equals 1, the benchmark speci-
fies that the DoF gain is limited. Although other works,
e.g. blind interference alignment scheme (BIA), achieve
a better DoF, it requires that the transceiver antenna ratios
are at some special value points [29], or the channel is
broadcast channel [30], both of which are not satisfied in
the considered network.
•Benchmark with instantaneous CSIT: This benchmark,
referenced from [31], assumes that the desired signal10

and interference have different time delays so that each
user krcan obtain up to half of the available time
resources without interference. However, the latencies of
satellite and D2D communications are different, making
the assumptions hard to be satisfied.
•Benchmark with delayed CSIT: This benchmark, ref-
erenced from [32], selectively adopts the retrospective
interference alignment (RIA) scheme, precoding schedul-
ing redundancy (PSR) scheme, and TDMA groups (TG)
scheme based on specific values of transceiver antenna
ratios and the number of received terminals to achieve
optimal DoF.
For the aesthetics of the figures, the abbreviations ICSI, DCSI,
and NCSI are used to represent instantaneous CSI, delayed
CSI, and no CSI, respectively. Similarly, PS and BM are
used to abbreviate the proposed scheme and the benchmark,
respectively.
A. Sum DoF with UAV-RIS
We set Kd= 6,Ms= (Kd+ 1)N, and alter the value of
Nto observe the change in DoF. From Fig. 3, it is observed
that all curves show an increase as the number of Nis
increased, indicating a growing capacity of the system. Since
the assumption of sufficient Msis satisfied, the DoF does not
reach its peak and remains stable. Besides, it is seen that both
PS and BM achieve the highest DoF gain with ICSI, followed
by DCSI, and finally NCSI. This suggests that more ideal CSI
results in higher DoF gains, while DCSI can be viewed as a
compromise between ICSI and NCSI. Notably, even when PS
designs precoding with NCSI, its performance surpasses that
of BM with ICSI. This can be attributed to the introduction
of UA V-RIS, which assists in communication and allows PS
to leverage the favorable characteristics of RIS for effective
interference elimination. In conclusion, when sufficient Ms

is achieved, PS achieves DoF gains of 133.3%, 61.9%, and
250% compared to BM under the conditions of ICSI, DCSI,
and NCSI, respectively.
B. Sum DoF with Adequate Ms
Based on the previous analysis, we focus on comparing the
ICSI BM with the proposed schemes in the following evalu-
ations. The system configuration remains Ms= (Kd+ 1)N,
and we vary the values of NandKdto study the DoF changes.
From Fig. 4, it is evident that the sum DoF increases when
there are more D2D pairs or when each D2D pair has more
antennas, although the rate of increase differs across schemes.
Notably, the change in sum DoF with respect to Nis consistent
for all schemes, with a 50% DoF gain observed when N
ranges from 2 to 3. This can be attributed to the availability
of sufficient Ms, enabling the design of optimal precoding11

at the transmitter. On the other hand, when Kdvaries from
2 to 10, the ICSI PS, DCSI PS, and NCSI PS achieve DoF
gains of 266.7%,461.1%, and 266.7%, respectively. It is worth
noting that the DCSI PS exhibits the fastest growth in DoF
with respect to Kd, making it more suitable for multi-user
scenarios. For instance, when Kd= 10 , the DoF of DCSI PS
atN= 2 even surpasses the DoF of NCSI PS at N= 3.
Overall, regardless of the changes in KdandN, the proposed
PS scheme with any type of CSI consistently outperforms the
ICSI BM in terms of DoF, highlighting the advantageous role
of UA V-RIS in assisting communication.
C. Sum DoF with Inadequate Ms
The previous conclusions were derived under the assump-
tion of sufficient Ms. However, if Msis insufficient, all
PS schemes experience different degrees of DoF loss. To
investigate the DoF loss in each PS scheme, we set Kd= 6,
N= 3, and vary the value of Msfrom 3 to 99. From Fig.
5, we observe different behaviors for each scheme. For NCSI
PS, the DoF remains stable as Msincreases. This is because
the satellite cannot design the precoding matrix based on CSI,so a larger Msdoes not result in any DoF gain. For DCSI PS,
the curve initially remains constant, then suddenly surges and
subsequently falls. This behavior repeats in cycles until the
curve converges. The constant intervals in DoF arise from the
fact that the number of Msis too small to achieve significant
gain, thus the satellite prefers designing the precoding matrix
with no CSI. As Mscontinues to increase, reaching a critical
point adds an additional slot in the second phase of DCSI PS,
leading to more efficient spatial utilization. However, adding
antennas based on the critical points introduces redundant
signals, resulting in new interference towards the received ter-
minals and causing DoF loss. When Msbecomes sufficiently
large, the DoF growth tends to approach 0, as it is limited by
the outer bound and cannot surpass the inner bound of ICSI
PS. For ICSI PS, the curve initially remains constant, then
suddenly surges and stabilizes. When the next critical point is
reached, the DoF surges again and reaches the inner bound.
The reason for the surge is similar to DCSI PS, while the
constant DoF intervals occur because the interference caused
by the redundant antennas at the satellite side is completely
eliminated, preventing DoF loss. In summary, when Msis at
its minimum value, Ms=N, all three PS schemes achieve a
16.7%DoF gain compared to the ICSI BM. When Msreaches
99, whose value is sufficiently large, the PS schemes achieve
DoF gains of 133.3%,89.2%, and 16.7%based on the ICSI
BM for ICSI, DCSI, and NCSI, respectively.
VIII. C ONCLUSION
The study of SAGIN involved the introduction of UA V-RIS
to assist in the elimination of interference and the considera-
tion of CSI latency to differentiate the types of CSIs obtained
by different terminals. To cope with the interference caused
by the complex network structure, a novel IM scheme was
proposed. The performance of this scheme was analyzed for
the satellite with instantaneous CSI, delayed CSI, and no CSI.
Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed IM scheme
outperformed the benchmarks in terms of DoF, highlighting
the benefits of incorporating UA V-RIS. Additionally, the DoF
gain of the proposed scheme was evaluated for different CSIs
while maintaining the same system configuration, providing
insights into the impact of CSI on performance.
