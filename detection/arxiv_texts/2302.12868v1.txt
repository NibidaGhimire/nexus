Natural and engineered media usually involve combinations of solid, uid and porous layers,
and accurate and stable modelling of wave propagation in such complex multilayered media is
fundamental to evaluating their properties with wave-based methods. Here we present a general
stiness matrix method for modelling waves in arbitrary multilayers. The method rst formulates
stiness matrices for individual layers based on the governing wave equations for uids and solids,
and the Biot theory for porous materials. Then it utilises the boundary conditions considered at
layer interfaces to assemble the layer matrices into a global system of equations, to obtain solutions
for reection and transmission coecients at any incidence. Its advantage over existing methods is
manifested by its unconditional computational stability, and its validity is proved by experimental
validations on single solid sheets, porous layers, and porous-solid-porous battery electrodes. This
establishes a powerful theoretical platform that allows us to develop advanced wave-based methods
to quantitatively characterise properties of the layers, especially for layers of porous materials.
I. INTRODUCTION
Multilayered media are ubiquitous in nature as well as
in engineering structures, with examples spanning from
minerals and the Earth's crust to composite laminates
and electrochemical systems (such as batteries). The
layers normally consist of dierent material types, com-
monly involving solids and oftentimes uid and porous
layers. The resulting structures are generally complex,
with a representative case being the electrodes of lithium-
ion batteries, with two uid-saturated porous layers
coated on a thin solid metal sheet.
Consequently, multilayered media typically exhibit
unique structural and functional properties. Achieving
and maintaining the properties relies strongly on non-
destructive methods to evaluate them and to monitor
their changes. Ultrasonic testing is frequently used for
this purpose and has facilitated many application areas,
such as the estimation of the thicknesses of thin lay-
ered sheets [1, 2], the inspection of composite laminates
[3, 4], and the characterisation of the layered structures
of lithium-ion batteries [5, 6]. Such evaluations generally
utilise the information about the layers that the ultra-
sonic waves carry after interacting with them. Therefore,
for an ultrasonic method to deliver optimal results, un-
derstanding the wave interactions with the layered media
through physical models is essential.
Matrix formulations are most commonly used for such
models with arbitrary numbers of layers. As the earli-
est formulation, the transfer matrix method [7, 8] relates
the stresses and displacements at one interface of a layer
to those at the other interface. With continuity at the
interfaces considered, the method produces a matrix for
the entire system by multiplying the matrices of individ-
ual layers. Solving the nal matrix equation in dierent
ways can deliver solutions for wave reections and trans-
missions as well as guided waves in the system. How-
Corresponding author: bo.lan@imperial.ac.ukever, it suers from computational instability at large fd
(fis frequency and dlayer thickness) as inhomogeneous
evanescent waves arise [9, 10]. To resolve this problem,
a number of alternative formulations were proposed, and
the global matrix method [11, 12] emerged as one of the
preferred substitutes. Instead of using matrix multipli-
cations, the global matrix method assembles the transfer
matrices of all layers into a global system of equations.
Its stability is achieved by eliminating the diverging expo-
nential terms using dierent spatial origins for the partial
waves [13, 14]. Another attractive approach to achieving
computational stability at large fdis the stiness matrix
method [15, 16], which uses a stiness matrix to link the
stresses at the two interfaces of a layer to the respective
displacements. This method can be implemented in a re-
cursive form [15] similar to the matrix multiplication of
the transfer matrix method, and can also be formulated
in a global matrix form [16] in the same fashion as for
transfer matrices. Both forms are unconditionally com-
putationally stable. These matrix-based methods have
received numerous applications in various elds, most no-
tably in seismology [17], ocean acoustics [18], composites
[19, 20] and guided ultrasonics [21, 22].
Although the matrix formulations focused mainly on
solid layers and occasionally on uid ones (e.g. [23, 24]),
signicant attention also centred on the development of
matrix descriptions for porous layers. The formulations
were mostly based on the Biot theory [25{28] to describe
the complex wave mechanics in uid-saturated porous
media. They all utilised transfer matrices to model the
Biot waves in individual porous layers, but relied dif-
ferently on matrix multiplication and global matrices
to assemble layer matrices. The matrix multiplication
method only applies to layered systems containing pure
porous layers [29, 30] or alternating uid/solid-porous
layers [31], while the global matrix method is a more gen-
eral model for arbitrarily stacked uid, solid and porous
layers [32, 33]. These developments have seen applica-
tions in, e.g., seismology [34] and sound-absorbing ma-
terials [33]. They are particularly useful for the inverse
determination of important properties (porosity, tortu-arXiv:2302.12868v1  [physics.class-ph]  24 Feb 20232
osity etc.) for porous materials [33, 35], and compared
to non-matrix based inversion studies that are limited
to single/double-layered settings [36{38], they can deal
with more complex cases with many layers of dierent
types. However, the aforementioned instability problem
arises, not only in the instability-prone matrix multipli-
cation method but also to the supposedly-stable global
matrix method. The problem in the former case occurs
constantly at large fd[30], while that of the latter case,
according to our analyses, arises less predictably at large
incident angles of porous layers.
In this work, we present an intrinsically-stable stiness
matrix method for layered media with arbitrary numbers
of uid, solid and porous layers. The novelties and ad-
vantages are threefold. Firstly, the proposed method em-
ploys stiness matrices to describe individual layers and
uses global matrices to model assembled layers. Owing
to the superior stability of both formulations, the pro-
posed method exhibits intrinsic computational stability,
and most importantly, it works exceptionally well for the
cases that challenged existing methods. This allows us
to reliably model highly-transmissible waves and guided
modes that involve large wave angles in porous layers.
Secondly, the proposed method is optimised to have sim-
ple expressions for both stiness matrices and bound-
ary conditions even for complex porous layers, thus en-
abling much easier computer implementation. Lastly, the
proposed method is validated against experimental mea-
surements to be working well for arbitrary single solid
sheets, porous layers, and porous-solid-porous combina-
tions. Based on the contributions, advanced ultrasonic
techniques may be developed to characterise the prop-
erties of layered media, and an imperative application
is to quantify the performance determinants of porous
electrodes in lithium-ion batteries.
The paper is organised as follows. Section II provides
a concise review of the well-established wave physics in
dierent layer materials. Then Sec. III presents the pro-
posed stiness matrix method, demonstrating how the
wave physics in individual layers are modelled by sti-
ness matrices and how the layer matrices are assembled
into global matrices to obtain wave solutions. This is fol-
lowed by experimental validations in Sec. IV to showcase
the applicability of the method to complex layered me-
dia with a single solid/porous layer and multiple porous-
solid-porous layers. Section V concludes this paper.
II. WAVE PHYSICS IN INDIVIDUAL LAYERS
We address a general problem of wave propagation in
an arbitrary multilayer, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The
medium contains nlayers with innite dimensions in the
x- andy-directions, and layer iis dened by interfaces
zi 1andziin thez-direction with thickness di=zi 
zi 1. The layered system is bounded by half-spaces 0 and
n+ 1 on the two sides.
Individual layers in the system are each occupied bya uid, elastic solid or uid-saturated porous material.
All three types of materials are treated as macroscopi-
cally isotropic and homogeneous. Wave propagation in
individual layers is governed by dierent wave physics,
depending on the nature of the layer material. The well-
established governing equations in the three considered
materials are reviewed in this section, and the stiness
matrix method will be formulated based upon them in
the next.
A. Fluid and solid layers
We start with uid and solid layers that involve rel-
atively simple wave physics. With linear elasticity as-
sumed and body forces neglected, wave propagation in
uid and solid materials is governed by the wave equa-
tion [39]

FIG. 1. Wave propagation in a multilayered medium with
uid, solid and porous layers. The medium has nlayers and
is bounded by half-spaces 0 and n+1. An incident wave from
0 induces a reected wave back into 0 and a wave transmitted
through the layers to n+1. Layeriis dened by the interfaces
ofzi 1andziand the thickness of di=zi zi 1. Each
layer is consisted of a uid, solid or uid-saturated porous
material. There is one wave (longitudinal L) in uid, two
waves (longitudinal L and shear S) in solid, and three (fast
L1 and slow L2 longitudinal, and shear) in a porous material.3
where uid has an omnidirectional stress p(also known as
pressure) as a result of dilatation "kk, while solid exhibits

"kk="xx+"yy+"zz=ru: (5)
Substituting the above strain-displacement relation
into the Hooke's law and then into Eq. 1 leads to an
equation for the displacement eld u. The equation can
be further written for the scalar 'and vector Hpoten-
tials by using the Helmholtz decomposition [39, 40]
u=r'+rH: (6)
The two potentials describe respectively the longitudi-
nal (dilatational) and shear (rotational) waves in the
medium. For uids, the vector potential Hvanishes due
to the absence of shear waves, and solving the resulting
wave equation for the scalar potential delivers a longitu-
dinal wave solution with wave speed
cL=p
K=: (7)
For solids, the wave equation is decoupled into two equa-
tions for the scalar and vector potentials respectively.
The two equations give respectively the longitudinal and
shear wave solutions, having the wave speeds of
cL=p
(K+ 4G=3)=; c S=p
G=: (8)
Note we have conveniently treated the two dierently-
polarised shear waves as a single wave mode because they
have the the same speed in the considered isotropic solid.
This applies to the porous media as discussed below.
B. Fluid-saturated porous layers
Now we consider uid-saturated porous layers. The
wave physics are much more complicated in this case
and are addressed by the widely-employed Biot theory
[25{27] (or empirically by other models such as [41, 42]).
Here, the solid frame is considered to be continuous, and
the pores fully connected and saturated with uid. The
propagating wave is subjected to attenuation induced by
scattering in the solid phase, and viscous and inertial
dissipation in the uid phase. When the wavelength is
large compared to the average pore size, the propagating
wave can be treated in a homogenised sense. The average
displacement elds can then be characterised by us(x;t)
anduf(x;t) in the solid (`s') and uid (`f') phases. Thetwo wave elds are coupled and described by the wave
equations [25, 43]

a speed slower than that of the solid and faster than
the saturated uid. The slower wave L2 travels predom-
inantly in the uid phase, having a speed slower than
the uid. The shear wave equation yields only one so-

III. STIFFNESS MATRIX METHOD
With the wave physics in individual layers discussed,
here we address the propagation of waves in the en-
tire layered system by formulating the stiness matrix
method.
A. Stiness matrix for the two interfaces of a layer

trix relation for a layer iby [15]

which relates the stress vectors on the two interfaces
to the respective displacement vectors uby the stiness
matrix K. Note that layer iis bounded by the inter-
facesi 1 andi(see Fig. 1), and layers and interfaces
are dierently indicated by superscripts and subscriptsthroughout this paper wherever possible. The displace-
ment and stress vectors each has mcomponents that are
representative of the mwave modes in the layer. As clar-
ied in the preceding section, the uid, solid and porous
layers considered in this work have m= 1, 2 and 3 wave
modes, respectively. Here we emphasise again that the
two dierently-polarised shear waves are treated as a sin-
gle shear wave mode for solids and porous materials. We
choose the displacement and stress vectors as
Fluid : u= [uz]T;= [p]T; (31)
Solid : u= [uz;ux]T;= [zz;xz]T;(32)
Porous : u= [uz;us

xz;^zz]T;(33)
where the dependencies on space fx;y;zgand timetare
implied. For porous layers, the components us
xands

are for the solid frame; the other four components, how-
ever, contain the displacements and stresses of both the
solid and uid phases, given by

which are chosen to ease the denition of boundary con-
ditions in the next subsection; this will be discussed in
detail below.
To obtain the displacement and stress vectors, we write
the scalar'and vector Hpotentials in a layer as [21, 30]
Fluid :'=UL;H=0; (38)
Solid :'=UL;H= [0;US;0]T; (39)
Porous :'s=UL1+UL2;Hs= [0;US;0]T; (40)

with
Ui= (a+
ieikizz+a 
ie ikizz)ei(kxx !t); (42)
wherei2fL;L1;L2;Sg. Here each scalar potential cor-
responds to a longitudinal wave mode and each vector
potential to a shear mode. Without loss of generality,
the nonzero components in the vector potentials are as-
sumed to be in the ydirection, meaning that the particle
motion of the shear waves lies in the x-zplane. Each
wave mode travels in both the forward (`+') and back-
ward (`{') directions, and these two waves are represented
by the two terms in Eq. 42 with amplitudes a+anda .
In addition, it is implied in the potentials that the in-
cident wave has a wavenumber component of kxin the
transversex-direction of the layered system. According
to the Snell's law, all propagating waves in all layers have
the same transverse component of wavenumber. As a re-
sult, the common term ei(kxx !t)in Eq. 42 is invariant,5
and the wavenumber component in the z-direction for a
wavei(i2fL;L1;L2;Sg) is given by
kiz=q
k2
i k2x; (43)
where the total wavenumber kiis related to the wave
speedcibyki=!=ci, with!= 2fbeing the angular
frequency. Also, we have to emphasise that the poten-
tials are given separately for the solid and uid phases
in a porous medium, in the same fashion as for the dis-
placement and stress elds in Sec. II. The potentials for
the two phases are related by the ratios idue to the
coupling of the wave elds between the two phases. The
ratios can be obtained from the physical relations in Sec.
II, given by [35]
L1= (~11 P=c2
L1)=(Q=c2
L1 ~12); (44)
L2= (~11 P=c2
L2)=(Q=c2
L2 ~12); (45)
S= ~12=~22: (46)
In the potentials, the z-coordinate origin of each wave
is dened to be at its entry to the layer. Therefore, for-
ward propagating waves (L+, L1+, L2+, S+) in a layer i
have their origin at zi 1and backward propagating waves
(L{, L1{, L2{, S{) have their origin at zi. Such selection
ensures that every single exponential term in the poten-
tials is normalised to unity on its entry interface and
decays towards the exit interface. This essentially elimi-
nates the numerical overow of the exponential terms as
the waves become inhomogeneous, thus impeding numer-
ical instability [15, 21].
Based on the potentials, the components of the dis-
placement vector uin Eqs. 31-33 are obtained using the
Helmholtz decomposition (Eq. 6). For a given layer i,
the displacement vector can then be evaluated at its two
interfaceszi 1andzi, leading to a matrix-form result

across the interface i(subscript) between layers iand
i+ 1 (superscript); see Fig. 1 for the numbering of layers
and interfaces. BandCare the boundary matrices for
the displacement and stress vectors.
The boundary matrices vary depending on the mate-
rial types of the two neighbouring layers. When the two
layers are made of the same material, the displacements
and stresses of the two layers need to be continuous across
the interface, resulting in the boundary matrices
Bi
i= Bi+1
i=Ci
i= Ci+1
i=Imm; (52)
where Immrepresents the identity matrix of size m.
When the two layers have dierent material types, they
involve dierent numbers of wave modes m, leading to
dierent numbers of components in the displacement and
stress vectors. In this case, the boundary matrices are
complicated by the fact that there are not only continuity
conditions but also Dirichlet conditions for the displace-
ment and/or stress components. Across a uid-solid in-
terface for example, beside the two continuity conditions
uf
z=us
zandpf=s
zz, an extra Dirichlet condition exists
for the shear stress of the solid layer (namely s
xz= 0)
due to the lack of shear stresses in the neighbouring uid.
These three conditions translate to the boundary matri-
ces in Table II, alongside those for other interface types.
Before proceeding, we shall revisit the choice of the
displacement and stress components for porous layers
in Eqs. 34-37. As aforementioned, the choice makes
it straightforward to dene boundary conditions, speci-
cally: (1) Equating uzin Eq. 34 to the uzof a neighbour-
ing layer prescribes the conservation of uid and solid
volume through a uid- or solid-porous interface. (2)
Applying the Dirichlet condition to ^ uzin Eq. 35 ensures
no mass is lost over a solid-porous interface. (3) The
equality of pin Eq. 36 to the porzzof a neighbour-
ing uid or solid layer satises the continuity of normal

condition on ^ zzin Eq. 37 additionally guarantees the
continuity of uid pressure across a uid-porous interface.
These aspects deliver very simple boundary matrices as
given in Table II despite the complex wave physics in
porous layers.

775=0:(54)With this procedure applied to all interfaces of a layered
system, a global matrix for the interfacial displacements
can be obtained. We note that a recursive algorithm can
be used instead if all layers belong to the same material
type [15], leading to an assembled stiness matrix with
the same dimension as that of a single stiness matrix.
This recursive method, however, is not considered here
because we attempt to address a general case with arbi-
trarily stacked uid, solid and porous layers.
The reection and transmission coecients for a lay-
ered system can be calculated upon substituting the wave
conditions in the two half-spaces 0 and n+ 1 (see Fig.
1) into the global matrix. Without loss of generality,
the two half-spaces are considered to be occupied by the
same uid material, which is the case for air- and water-
coupled congurations as commonly used for the testing
of layered structures. In the half-space 0, a monochro-
matic plane wave is impinged on the z= 0 surface at
an incident angle of . Thus, the incident wave has the
wavenumber components of
kx=k0
Lsin; k0
Lz=k0
Lcos; (55)

Lis the wavenumber in the half-space 0.
As used throughout this paper, the x-direction wavenum-
ber component kxis a common term shared by all waves
in the entire structure, which is prescribed by the Snell's
law.
As the incident wave comes into the layered medium,
part of the wave is reected back into the half-space 0,
and the rest travels through the layers and is transmit-
ted into the half-space n+ 1. Let us assume the incident
wave to have a unit amplitude, then the amplitudes of
the reected and transmitted waves equal to the reec-
tionRand transmission Tcoecients of the system. In
this case, the amplitude vectors for the half-spaces 0 and
n+ 1 are A0= [1;R]TandAn+1= [T;0]T(note the
absence of backward travelling wave in n+ 1). To avoid
having an origin at  1 in the half-space 0, we place the
z-coordinate origin of both forward and backward prop-
agating waves at the interface 0. Then from Eqs. 47 and

be discussed in detail here, we emphasise that above for-
mulations can be easily adapted to other boundary con-
ditions, such as those bounded by an impervious hard
wall on one side and those by solids on both sides.
D. Relation to transfer matrix method and
stability
The stiness matrix method is closely related to the
well-established transfer matrix method [30, 32, 33]. To
demonstrate this relationship, we reorganise the displace-
ments and stresses in Eqs. 47 and 48 to the two layer
interfaces, yielding

which relates the displacements and stresses on the in-
terfacei 1 to those on the interface iof the layer i.
The elements of the transfer matrix Tcan be expressed
by those of the stiness matrix K(and vice versa) [15];
the expressions are not provided here because they are
numerically unstable. Using the boundary conditions in
Eqs. 50 and 51, the transfer matrix relation is assembled
into a global matrix form in order to solve the wave re-
ection and transmission problem in the layered system
in the same fashion as presented above [32, 33].
As mentioned, the stiness matrix formulation brings
the benet of intrinsic stability. To compare it with
transfer matrix method, we have run a wide variety of
calculation cases with the layered system containing dif-
ferent numbers of layers of dierent material types. The
stiness matrix method is found to be numerically sta-
ble in all cases; while the transfer matrix method deliv-
ers practically identical results when numerically-stable,
it does suer from instability under certain conditions,
even when assembled in the global matrix conguration.
This might seem contradicting to the discussions in [21]
and in the Introduction - the transfer matrix method is
supposed to be free from instability in global matrix for-
mulation. This is found to be indeed true for the cases
involving uid and/or solid layers only. However, insta-
bility does arise for porous layers, potentially due to the
existence of slow waves (slower speed than waves in uid).
A prominent example case is provided in Figure 2 for a
porous layer, showing unstable blow-ups at high frequen-
cies beyond the rst critical angle. Another unstable case
arises at the f!0 limit where instability leads to a
non-unity transmission coecient (supposed to be unity
because the layered structure is transparent to the trans-
mitting wave). This latter case is less important so is
not plotted here. Our stiness matrix method does not
suer from these issues and is thus more advantageous.
IV. RESULTS AND EXPERIMENTAL
VALIDATION
Having fully established the stiness matrix method,
we present wave propagation results predicted by it (re-
ferred to as `theory') and compare them with experi-
mental measurements for a range of layered media. We
employ the experimental setup sketched in Fig. 3(a).
The sample is placed between two ultrasonic transduc-
ers, with the source transducer generating wave into the
coupling uid and the receiver transducer recording the

layer is bounded by water [35], and this calculation case will
be studied in detail in Fig. 5. (a) and (c) Amplitudes of the

wave that travelled through the uid-sample-uid path.
The sample is mounted vertically onto a stepper motor-
driven rotary stage and the angle between the incident
wave and the sample surface is thus automatically con-
trolled. The two transducers are each xed onto a kine-
matic mount, through which they are adjusted to have
their axes aligned and their active surfaces parallel to the
sample surface at the normal incidence of = 0.
We consider three samples of gradually increasing com-
plexity as illustrated in Fig. 3(b). To experimentally
measure the transmission coecient of each sample, a
reference signal ur(t) is rst acquired when the sam-
ple is absent, and then the transmitted signal ut(t)
through the sample is recorded at a desired incident an-
gle. Example reference signal and transmitted signal
through the solid steel sample at 22 :5are provided in
Fig. 3(c), which are acquired using a pair of 0.5 MHz
transducers. The two signals are subsequently trans-
formed into the frequency domain to obtain the spec-
traUr(f) andUt(f); see Fig. 3(d) and (e) for the am-
plitude and phase spectra of the example signals. The
frequency-dependent transmission coecient at is cal-
culated by T(f) =Ut(f)=Ur(f)e ikfdcos, with the ex-
ponential term accounting for the propagation across the
sample thickness din the coupling uid (with wave num-
berkfcosin the propagation direction) when the sam-
ple is absent. The transmission coecient is mostly small
especially in an air-coupled setting, and the transmitted
signal is thus very weak. To reach a signal-to-noise ratio
of around 30 dB for the transmitted signal, the voltage of
the excitation (5-cycle Hann-windowed toneburst) to the
source transducer is maintained at around 100 V and the9

A. Single solid layer
We start with a simple case of a solid layer submerged
in air at 20C room temperature. The properties of
the sample is given in Fig. 4(a), and those of air are
K= 1:4105Pa,= 1:3 kg/m3and= 1:810 5Pas.
This case is an important rst step for understanding
wave propagation in multilayered media, such as battery

electrodes that have a thin solid layer in the middle as
discussed later.
The theoretical transmission coecient amplitude jTj
is provided in Fig. 4(b) as a function of frequency fand
incident angle . Since the amplitude spans over a few
orders of magnitude, a logarithmic colour scale is used in
the plot for better visualisation. At low frequencies where
the wavelength is substantially larger than the sample
thickness, the transmission coecient in all directions ap-
proaches unity, meaning that nearly all energy is trans-
mitted through the layer as if the layer is not present.
The transmission coecient is mostly very small at other
frequencies, but it tends to reach unity again at large in-
cident angles beyond the two critical angles of 3 :5and
6:2. This large-angle, highly-transmissible region arises
due to the excitation of the fundamental anti-symmetric
guided wave (A 0mode) in the thin layer as detailed in
our prior work [45]. Physically, the wave resonates in the
layer at the presence of the A 0mode, and it causes the
majority of the energy to travel through the layer to the
other side.
The theoretical prediction is corroborated by the ex-
perimental results in Fig. 4(c) and (d) that are collected
using three pairs of air-coupled transducers with the fre-
quencies of 0.5, 0.7 and 1.0 MHz. The two gure plots
display respectively the angle dependence of the trans-
mission coecient amplitude at f= 0:5 and 0.7 MHz
and the frequency dependence at = 22:5and 43:5.
Both plots show very good agreement between the the-
ory and the experiment. Prominently, in comparison to
the experiment, the theory has accurately predicted the10
ne details at, and around, the highly-transmissible A 0
peaks. We have also carried out experiments on 250 and
500Âµm thick samples and the results show similar theory-
experiment agreement and transmission characteristics.
B. Single porous layer
Going further, we analyse wave transmission through
a porous layer of the same granular microstructure as
active battery electrodes. We consider a well-studied
porous material made of sintered glass beads [35, 46{48]
as its microstructure characteristics are highly control-
lable. We use the parameters and experimental results
of the sample S3 by Jocker et al. [35]. The sample has
the parameters in Fig. 5(a) and is submerged in water of
K= 2:2 GPa,= 1000 kg/m3and= 0:001 Pas. Fig-
ure 5(b) gives the wave speed and attenuation coecient
of the three Biot waves in the porous medium, namely
the fast and slow longitudinal waves and the shear wave.
As aected by the porous network (porosity, tortuosity,
permeability etc), the two faster waves travel more slowly
than in pure glass (5850 and 3250 m/s [43]) and the slow
wave is even slower than in the uid (1483 m/s). Also,
the three waves exhibit dierent levels of attenuation, in-
creasing around an order of magnitude each from the fast
longitudinal through the shear to the slow longitudinal
waves. The three waves show distinctive wave speed and
attenuation characteristics in the low-frequency viscous
and high-frequency inertial regimes separated by the vis-
cous characteristic frequency fc= 0:013 MHz. In the
viscous regime, the slow wave demonstrates more pro-
nounced wave speed dispersion but smaller increase of
attenuation with frequency than the other two waves. By
contrast, all three waves tend to have constant speeds and
the same power dependence of attenuation on frequency
in the inertial regime.
Our theoretical prediction of the transmission coef-
cient through the sample is given in Fig. 5(c) and
(d), showing respectively the amplitude and phase maps
against frequency fand incident angle . The transmis-
sion is small beyond the critical angle of the fast longi-
tudinal wave, which is annotated as the solid line in the
maps. Below this critical angle, the transmission coef-
cient exhibits a cyclic behaviour, which is particularly
obvious as we look along the horizontal line at the normal
incidence of = 0in the amplitude map. This cyclic
behaviour arises because of the resonances of the three
waves, predominately the fast longitudinal wave, rever-
berating between the two boundaries of the porous layer.
The resonances also cause small phase uctuations as can
be seen in the phase map.
Figure 5(c) and (d) compare our theoretical prediction
with experimental results [35] at the incident angles of
= 0and= 18, respectively. In both cases, the the-
ory agrees remarkably well with the experimental points
in both amplitude and phase, building our condence in
using the theory to describe multilayered porous elec-

Now we examine wave transmission through a porous-

both sides of a 10 Âµm copper lm. The active layer has
a granular porous microstructure with graphite particles
joined together by binder materials. The active material
has been well characterised using advanced techniques
[49{51] and the relevant parameters are summarised in
Fig. 6(a). The three Biot waves in the active mate-
rial are detailed in Fig. 6(b), showing similar speed and
attenuation proles to those in sintered glass beads in11

Fig. 5(b). The use of airborne ultrasound in this case
and the micron-level pore structure lead the slow longi-
tudinal wave to have exceptionally small speed and ex-
cessively large attenuation. Thus, in comparison to the
other two waves, the slow wave has minimal contribution
to the transmitted wave. In addition, the large viscous
characteristic frequency of fc= 9:75 MHz means that we
have to focus in the viscous regime because the inertial
regime can barely be reached with an air-coupled setup
(generally limited to 5 MHz).
Figure 6(c) and (d) display respectively the theoreti-
cal amplitude and phase maps of the transmission coef-
cient through the anode. As in a single solid or porous
layer, the wave perceives the anode as transparent irre-
spective of the incident angle in the low-frequency, long-
wavelength range. At higher frequencies, the wave tun-
nels through the anode when the frequency and incident
angle are suitably combined to excite guided wave modes
in individual layers or in the whole anode, evidenced alsoby thephase jump in the phase map. The highly-
transmissible tunneling is reminiscent of the above single
solid layer but shows many more complex features due
to the multilayered nature of the anode.
The theoretical results are evaluated against experi-
mental measurements in Fig. 6(e) and (f). The theory
matches very well with the experiment, particularly in
the transmission amplitude, from both the angle- and
frequency-dependent results. The agreement is less sat-
isfactory for the phase results in Fig. 6(e) because of the
diculty in obtaining accurate phase information from
noisy experimental signals. Overall, the evaluation re-
sults highlight the very good applicability of the theory
to describe wave transmission through complex multilay-
ered electrodes involving micron-level porous structures.
V. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
In summary, we have developed a general stiness ma-
trix method for modelling wave propagation in multilay-
ered media with arbitrary numbers and combinations of
uid, solid and porous layers. With individual layers de-
scribed by stiness matrices, and layer interfaces dened
by boundary conditions, the proposed method assembles
a global system of equations to solve the reection and
transmission of oblique waves in the layered system. The
method is intrinsically and unconditionally stable and is
thus more advantageous over existing transfer matrix-
based methods, which have been demonstrated to show
instability in certain congurations. Experimental vali-
dations have proved the validity of the proposed method
over a range of layered cases, ranging from single solid
and porous layers to a porous-solid-porous anode.
The presented work is a powerful modelling tool for
developing new methods to quantify the properties of
layered media. A particularly exciting possibility is the
quantication of the porous parameters (e.g. porosity,
tortuosity and permeability) in Li-ion battery electrodes,
which we have already analysed in this paper tentatively.
These electrode parameters are key performance determi-
nants of the batteries, hence non-destructive evaluation
capabilities, potentially oered by wave-based methods,
could bring considerable benets via closed-loop control
and quality assurance during battery manufacturing.
