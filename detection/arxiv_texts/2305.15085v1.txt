Abstract. We explain how Pusz–Woronowicz’s idea of their functional c alculus ﬁts the theory of
Lebesgue decomposition for positive operators on Hilbert s paces initially developed by Ando. In this
way, we reconstruct the essential and fundamental part of th e theory.
1.Introduction
Lebesgue decomposition for positive operators on Hilbert spaces w as introduced by Ando [1] in the
mid 70s, and then has been studied so far by many hands. It should b e regarded as an attempt to
generalize the Douglas decomposition theorem (see e.g., [2, Theorem 2.1]) and has a strong connection
to the notion of parallel sum, which was originally motivated from elect ronic networks but has played
an important role in the study of operator ranges illustrated by Fillmo re and Williams [2] as well as
in the study of binary operations such as operator connections/m eans. The aim of these notes is to
give a concise exposition on our idea towards yet another approach to Lebesgue decomposition, which
is, in some sense, a reorganization of various ideas implicitly appeared in previous works by means of
Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus [10] (see [4, 5] for its operat or-oriented treatment). We hope that
the idea will further be investigated by specialists in the direction.
LetA,Bbe positive bounded operators on a Hilbert space H. Ando introduced the concept that A
andBare mutually singular, say A⊥B, and the one that BisA-absolutely continuous, say B⋖A.
He then introduced the maximal A-absolutely continuous part [ A]B, and of course, [ A]B⊥(B−[A]B)
holds true. Our initial observation is that ( A,B)/mapsto→[A]Bis a binary operation and can be understood
as a very special case of Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus; se e Theorem 3.8. This observation was
implicitly appeared in [5], but has not systematically be investigated so far. The observation explains
that Pusz–Woronowicz’s original construction of their functional calculus is essentially the same as von
Neumann’s famous clever proof ([13, Lemma 3.2.3] for its original for m; [11, Theorem 6.10] for its
exposition) of Lebesgue–Radon–Nikodym theorem for measures b ased on Hilbert space techniques. See
Remark 3.4. Moreover, it also enables us to investigate the maximal A-absolutely continuous part [ A]B
as Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus. For example, it is rather s traightforward in our approach to
prove Kosaki’s formula (that is now available in [8])
[A1⊗A2](B1⊗B2) = [A1]B1⊗[A2]B2.
See Corollary 3.9. Moreover, the mechanism behind this formula beco mes completely clear in our ap-
proach.
The previousworks[4],[5] and this workaltogethershowthat the Pus z–Woronowiczfunctional calculus
is a right framework to discuss all the well-established binary operat ions for positive operators, operator
means/connections, operator perspectives and the maximal abs olutely continuous part, in a uniﬁed way.
Moreover, all those binary operations are special cases of the Pu sz–Woronowicz functional calculus.
Part of the contents of these notes are originally conducted as pa rt of the ﬁrst author’s thesis project

2.Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus
Letφ(x,y) be a real-valued homogeneous Borel function over [0 ,∞)2that is bounded on any compact
subset. We will use the formulation of Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus (PW-functional calculus
for short)φ(A,B) with two positive bounded operators A,Bon a Hilbert space given in [5, Deﬁnition
4.1] (that originates in [4, Remark 10]), that is, a unique extension of the usual functional calculus for
commuting pairs of bounded positive operators in such a way that th e following property (called operator
homogeneity ) holds: If a bounded operator C:K → Hsatisﬁesran((A+B)1/2)⊆ran(C), then
φ(C∗AC,C∗BC) =C∗φ(A,B)C.
(We need the notion ofextended lowersemibounded self-adjoint pa rt/hatwiderB(H)lbwhenφ(x,y) is just assumed
to be bounded from below on each compact subset of [0 ,∞)2; see [5].)
We will explain an explicit construction for a not necessarily commuting pairA,Bof positive bounded
operators on a Hilbert space H. This construction itself is important in our approach to Lebesgue
decomposition for positive operators.
WriteHA,B:= ker(A+B)⊥= ker((A+B)1/2)⊥=ran((A+B)1/2), and deﬁne TA,B:H → H A,Bby
ξ∈ H /mapsto→(A+B)1/2ξ∈ HA,B, which has a dense range by deﬁnition. The mappings
(A+B)1/2ξ/mapsto→A1/2ξ,(A+B)1/2ξ/mapsto→B1/2ξ(ξ∈ H)
uniquely extend to contractive operators XA,B,YA,BfromHA,BtoHsuch thatXA,BTA,B=A1/2,
YA,BTA,B=B1/2. We deﬁne two bounded operators RA,B,SA,BonHA,BbyRA,B:=|XA,B|2=

A,BXA,BandSA,B:=|YA,B|2=Y∗
A,BYA,B. LetXA,B=UA,B|XA,B|,YA,B=VA,B|YA,B|be the polar
decompositions of XA,B,YA,B, respectively.
Lemma2.1 ([10,Theorem1.1]; seealso[4,Lemma1]) .RA,B+SA,B= 1HA,B. In particular, (RA,B,SA,B)
is a commuting pair of positive bounded operators on HA,B.
Lemma 2.2. DenoteIA,B:={C∈B(H) ;O≤C≤A+B}andJA,B:={˜C∈B(HA,B) ;O≤˜C≤
IHA,B}. The map ΓA,B:JA,B→IA,Bdeﬁned by
ΓA,B(˜C) =T∗
A,B˜CTA,B
is bijective and satisﬁes ΓA,B(RA,B) =A,ΓA,B(SA,B) =BandΓA,B(IHA,B) =A+B. Moreover, both
ΓA,Band its inverse map Γ−1
A,Bare order-preserving.
Proof.(Injectivity) If ˜C,˜D∈JA,Bare such that Γ A,B(˜C) = ΓA,B(˜D), then
((A+B)1/2ξ,˜C(A+B)1/2η) = (ξ,ΓA,B(˜C)η) = (ξ,ΓA,B(˜D)η) = ((A+B)1/2ξ,˜C(A+B)1/2η)
for anyξ,η∈ H, and hence ˜C=˜D.
(Surjectivity) Let C∈IA,Bbe arbitrarily chosen. Due to the Douglas decomposition theorem (s ee
e.g., [2, Theorem 2.1]) there exists a unique D∈B(H) such that ( A+B)1/2D=C1/2and/bardblD/bardbl ≤1
hold. Multiplying the support projection of ( A+B)1/2toDfrom the left, we may and do regard Das
a bounded operator from HtoHA,B, and hence we have D∗TA,B=C1/2by taking the adjoint. Letting
˜C=DD∗∈JA,Bwe haveC= ΓA,B(˜C).
Finally, Γ A,Bis order-preservingby its construction, and hence so is the invers emap Γ−1
A,Btrivially. /squareLEBESGUE DECOMPOSITION FOR POSITIVE OPERATORS 3
Remarks 2.3. (1) The above map Γ A,Bnaturally extends to an order-preserving bijection from {C∈
B(H)+;O≤C≤α(A+B) for someα>0}to{˜C∈B(HA,B)+;O≤˜C≤βIHA,Bfor someβ >0}.
We still denote it by the same symbol.
(2) It is clear that Γ A,Bis strongly continuous. Moreover, if CλրCinIA,B, then
(Γ−1
A,B(Cλ)(A+B)1/2ξ,(A+B)1/2ξ) = (Cλξ,ξ)ր(Cξ,ξ) = (Γ−1

for anyξ∈ H. Hence we have Γ−1

With these preparations, we have

A,Bφ(RA,B,SA,B)TA,B= ΓA,B(φ(RA,B,SA,B))
by the operator homogeneity, and φ(RA,B,SA,B) is the usual functional calculus by Lemma 2.1. This is
an explicit construction of φ(A,B) and actually, a translationof Pusz–Woronowicz’soriginalconstru ction
of their functional calculus for positive sesquilinear forms [10] in ter ms of Hilbert space operators.
Here is a simple property on PW-functional calculus. We believe that t his property has not been
pointed out so far.
Theorem 2.4. Ifφ(x1x2,y1y2) =φ(x1,y1)φ(x2,y2)holds for every (x1,y1),(x2,y2)∈[0,∞)2, then
φ(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2) =φ(A1,B1)⊗φ(A2,B2)
holds for any (Ai,Bi)∈B(Hi)+×B(Hi)+,i= 1,2.
Proof.We setT:=TA1,B1⊗TA2,B2andR:=RA1,B1⊗RA2,B2,S:=SA1,B1⊗SA2,B2. Let
RAi,Bi=/integraldisplay1
0xEi(dx),(i= 1,2)
be the spectral decomposition.
SinceThas a dense range in HA1,B1⊗HA2,B2andA1⊗A2=T∗RT,B1⊗B2=T∗ST, the operator
homogeneity says that
φ(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2) =T∗φ(R,S)T.
By assumption, we have
φ(R,S) =/integraldisplay1
0/integraldisplay1
0φ(x1x2,(1−x1)(1−x2))E1(dx1)⊗E2(dx2)
=/integraldisplay1
0/integraldisplay1
0φ(x1,1−x1)φ(x2,1−x2)E1(dx1)⊗E2(dx2)
=φ(RA1,B1,SA1,B1)⊗φ(RA2,B2,SA2,B2)
(see e.g., [12, Theorem 8.2]), and hence we obtain the desired formula . /square
A typical example of φ(x,y) we can apply the above proposition to is ( x,y)/mapsto→xαy1−α= (x/y)αy. In
particular, this result is applicable to the weighted mean A♯αB.
Remark 2.5. The above theorem is still valid in some sense even when φ(x,y) is just bounded from
below on any compact subset, though its proof needs careful tre atment of ‘tensor products’ of extended
lower semibounded parts. Assume ψ(x,y) =xlog(x/y). Then, moreover, the way of the above proof
naturally suggests that ψ(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2) =ψ(A1,B1)⊗A2+A1⊗ψ(A2,B2) holds. This will be
discussed in appendix A.
In the rest of this section we devote to proving technical lemmas, w hich are necessary in the next
section.
Lemma 2.6. Ifφ(x,y)admits a representation φ(x,y) =yf(y)on{(x,y)∈[0,∞)2;x+y= 1}with
some bounded Borel function f(y)on[0,1]. Then we have
φ(A,B) =B1/2VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,BB1/2.
Moreover, if f(y)is an indicator function, then VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,Bmust be a projection.4 YOSHIKI AIBARA AND YOSHIMICHI UEDA
Proof.SinceRA,B+SA,B=IHA,B, we haveφ(RA,B,SA,B) =SA,Bf(SA,B) =S1/2

S1/2

A,BY∗
A,BVA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,BYA,BTA,B
=B1/2VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,BB1/2.
Iff(y) is an indicator function, the f(SA,B) is a projection. Since V∗
A,BVA,Bcommutes with f(SA,B),
it follows that
(VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,B)2=VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,BVA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,B=VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,B.
HenceVA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,Bis a projection. /square
Lemma 2.7. Letf(y)be a bounded Borel function on [0,1]. Then we have
f(YA,BY∗
A,B) =f(0)(I−VA,BV∗
A,B)+VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,B, (2.1)
and moreover,
B1/2VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,BB1/2=B1/2f(YA,BY∗
A,B)B1/2.
Proof.SinceVA,BSn
A,BV∗
A,B= (VA,BSA,BV∗
A,B)n= (YA,BY∗
A,B)nfor all positive integers n, we have
formula (2.1) when f(y) is a polynomial. Taking a uniform approximation to a given continuous f unction
on [0,1] by polynomials, we see that the same formula holds true even for a ny continuous function on
[0,1]. Then, appealing to the monotone class theorem we ﬁnally conﬁrm t hat formula (2.1) holds for a
general Borel function.
LetQ=I−VA,BV∗
A,Bbe the orthogonal projection onto ker( Y∗
A,B) =ran(YA,B)⊥. We observe that
ξ∈ker(Y∗
A,B)⇔(Y∗
A,Bξ,TA,Bη) = 0 (for all η∈ H)
⇔(ξ,B1/2η) = 0 (for all η∈ H)
⇔(B1/2ξ,η) = 0 (for all η∈ H)
⇔ξ∈ker(B1/2).
Thus we obtain B1/2QB1/2=O. Moreover, we have
B1/2f(YA,BY∗
A,B)B1/2=B1/2(f(0)Q+VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,B)B1/2=B1/2(VA,Bf(SA,B)V∗
A,B)B1/2.
Hence we are done. /square
Remark 2.8. Similarly, for any bounded Borel function f(x) on [0,1] we have

3.Lebesgue decomposition of positive operators
Let us begin by recalling the deﬁnitions introduced by Ando [1].
Deﬁnition 3.1. LetA,Bbe positive bounded operators on a Hilbert space. We say that AandBare
mutually singular, denoted by A⊥B, if there is no non-zero bounded operator Con the Hilbert space
satisfying that both O≤C≤AandO≤C≤B. We also say that BisA-absolutely continuous,
denoted by B⋖A, if there exists a sequence Bnof positive bounded operators on the Hilbert space such
thatBnրBasn→ ∞andBn≤αnAfor someαn>0.
In what follows, let A,Bbe positive bounded operators on a Hilbert space H. We will freely use the
notation given in section 2.
Lemma 3.2. The following conditions are equivalent:
(1)A⊥B.LEBESGUE DECOMPOSITION FOR POSITIVE OPERATORS 5
(2)RA,B⊥SA,B.
(3)RA,BandSA,Bform an orthogonal pair of projections.
Proof.In the proof, we will write Γ = Γ A,B,R=RA,BandS=SA,Bfor simplicity.
(1)⇒(2): Assume that O≤C≤RandO≤C≤S. Since Γ(R) =Aand Γ(S) =Bwe have
O≤Γ(C)≤AandO≤Γ(C)≤B. By assumption Γ( C) must beO, and hence C=Otoo by Lemma
2.2.
(2)⇒(3): LetERbe the spectral (projection-valued) measure of R. For any 0 <ε<1 we have
O≤εER([ε,1−ε])≤R, O ≤εER([ε,1−ε])≤IHA,B−R=S.
By assumption we obtain ER([ε,1−ε]) =O. Taking the limit as n→ ∞withε= 1/nwe have
ER((0,1)) =OandIHA,B=ER([0,1]) =ER({0}) +ER({1}). HenceR= (ER({0}) +ER({1}))R=
ER({1}), and similarly S=ER({0}).
(3)⇒(1): Assume that O≤C≤A,O≤C≤B. SinceC≤A+B, Lemma 2.2 ensures that there
is a unique O≤D≤IHA,Bsuch thatC= Γ(D). ThenD≤Γ−1(A) =RandD≤Γ−1(B) =S. Thus
RDR=SDS=Oby assumption. Then D1/2R=D1/2S=O. HenceD=ObecauseR+S=IHA,B./square
Deﬁnition 3.3. We say that B=B1+B2withB1,B2≤Bis anA-Lebesgue decomposition ofBif
B1⋖AandB2⊥A.
Remark 3.4. Let us recall von Neumann’s clever proof (see [11, Theorem 6.10]) of Lebesgue decompo-
sition for measures, which gave us a motivation to this work.
Letµ,νbe ﬁnite positive measures on a measurable space Ω. We set H=L2(λ) withλ=µ+ν. By
Riesz’s representation theorem we have µ(Λ) = (1Λ,R1Ω) = (1Λ,gµ),ν(Λ) = (1Λ,S1Ω) = (1Λ,gν) for
any measurable subset Λ ⊂Ω, wheregµ,gνare the unique elements of H=L2(λ) corresponding to the
bounded linear functionals f∈L2(λ)/mapsto→/integraltext
Ωfdµ∈C,f∈L2(λ)/mapsto→/integraltext
Ωfdν∈C, respectively, and R,S
are the multiplication operatorsof those functions, respectively. It is trivial that R,S≥OandR+S=I.
We deﬁneSc=SER((0,1]) with the spectral (projection-valued) measure ERofR, and setSs=S−Sc.
Then we obtain that Ss1Ω=gν1{gµ/ne}ationslash=0}andSc1Ω=gν1{gµ=0}. Theµ-Lebesgue decomposition of νis
given byν=νc+νs, whereνc(Λ) = (1Λ,Sc1Ω) andνs(Λ) = (1Λ,Ss1Ω) for any measurable subset Λ ⊂Ω.
The above remark suggests us to deﬁne the absolutely continuous and the singular parts ( SA,B)cand
(SA,B)sofSA,Bwith respect to RA,Bas follows.
Lemma 3.5. We deﬁne (SA,B)c:=SA,BERA,B((0,1])and(SA,B)s=SA,B−(SA,B)c=SA,BERA,B({0})
with the spectral (projection-valued) measure ERA,BofRA,B. Then(SA,B)c⋖RA,B,(SA,B)s⊥RA,B,
andSA,B= (SA,B)c+(SA,B)sis anRA,B-Lebesgue decomposition of SA,B.
Proof.In the proof, we will write R=RA,BandS=SA,Bfor simplicity.
We setSn=SER([1/n,1])≤Sc. ThenSnրScasn→ ∞, and moreover,
Sn=SER([1/n,1])≤ER([1/n,1])≤nRER([1/n,1])≤nR.
HenceSc⋖R.
Assume that O≤C≤RandO≤C≤Ss. Then,
O≤ER({0})CER({0})≤RER({0}) =O,
O≤ER((0,1])CER((0,1])≤SER((0,1]) =O.
ThenC1/2ER({0}) =O. Similarly, we have C1/2ER((0,1]) =O. HenceC=O. /square
Proposition 3.6. We setBc= ΓA,B((SA,B)c)andBs= ΓA,B((SA,B)s). ThenB=Bc+Bsis an
A-Lebesgue decomposition of B.
Proof.WriteBn= ΓA,B(Sn) withSnas in the proof of Lemma 3.5. By Lemma 2.2 and Remarks 2.3(2)
we haveBn≤BandBnրBasn→ ∞, and moreover,
Bn= ΓA,B(Sn)≤nΓA,B(RA,B) =nAA,B.6 YOSHIKI AIBARA AND YOSHIMICHI UEDA

Proposition 3.7. The operator Bcis the maximal one among all the A-absolutely continuous positive
bounded operators CwithC≤B.
Proof.LetCnbe an increasing sequence of positive bounded operators on Hsuch thatCnրCand
Cn≤αnAfor someαn>0. SinceCn≤C≤B≤A+B, we have

A,B(Cn)րΓ−1
A,B(C)≤SA,B. SinceERA,B({0})Γ−1
A,B(Cn)ERA,B({0}) =O, we have, as in the
proof of Lemma 3.5, Γ−1
A,B(Cn)ERA,B({0}) =ERA,B({0})Γ−1
A,B(Cn) =O. Taking the limit as n→ ∞,
Γ−1
A,B(C)ERA,B({0}) =ERA,B({0})Γ−1
A,B(C) =O. Thus

A,B(C) =ERA,B((0,1])Γ−1
A,B(C)ERA,B((0,1])≤ERA,B((0,1])SA,BERA,B((0,1]) = (SA,B)c,
and henceC≤Bc. /square
Here is the main but simple observation of these notes.
Theorem 3.8. The operator Bccoincides with Ando’s [A]B; namely,Bc= limn→∞(nA) :Bholds in
the strong operator topology, where (nA) :Bdenotes the parallel sum of nAandB(see e.g., [2, section
4]). Moreover, [A]B=Bcis given by the Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus φ⋗(A,B)with function
φ⋗(x,y) =1(0,∞)(x)y.
We remark that the function φ⋗(x,y) in the statement is indeed homogeneous (and trivially, bounded
on any compact subset of [0 ,∞)2). In fact,
φ⋗(λx,λy) =1(0,∞)(λx)λy=/braceleftbiggλy(x>0)
0 (x= 0)/bracerightbigg
=λφ⋗(x,y),(x,y)∈[0,∞)2, λ>0.
Although the previous proposition and [1, Theorem 1] (both assert the maximality) immediately show
Bc= [A]B, we will give a self-contained proof, i.e., without using Ando’s result.
Proof.SinceERA,B((0,1]) =1(0,∞)(RA,B), we have
Bc= ΓA,B(SA,BERA,B((0,1])) = Γ A,B(φ⋗(RA,B,SA,B)) =φ⋗(A,B).
For eachnwe deﬁneφn(x,y) =nxy
nx+ywithφn(0,0) = 0. As remarked in [4] (see the discussion
just after Theorem 6 there) we have ( nA) :B=φn(A,B) = ΓA,B(φn(RA,B,SA,B)) for every n. Letting
fn(y):=φn(1−y,y) we have
φn(RA,B,SA,B) =fn(SA,B) =/integraldisplay
[0,1]n(1−y)y
n(1−y)+yESA,B(dy),
whereESA,Bdenotes the spectral (projection-valued) measure of SA,B. Since
/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsinglen(1−y)y
n(1−y)+y/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle≤1 andn(1−y)y
n(1−y)+y→1(0,1](1−y)y=φ⋗(1−y,y),∀y∈[0,1],
the bounded convergence theorem implies that
φn(RA,B,SA,B) =fn(SA,B)→φ⋗(RA,B,SA,B) =SA,BERA,B((0,1]) =Sc
in the strong operator topology. Hence we obtain φ⋗(A,B) = lim n→∞(nA) :Bin the strong operator
topology too by Remarks 2.3(2). /square
We remark that Proposition 3.7 plus Theorem 3.8 imply [1, Theorem 2].
The next corollary is immediate from Theorem 2.4 thanks to the above theorem. (We ﬁrst learned
from Hiai that Kosaki already conﬁrmed the formula below many yea rs ago.)LEBESGUE DECOMPOSITION FOR POSITIVE OPERATORS 7
Corollary 3.9. (H. Kosaki) For eachk= 1,2, letAk,Bkbe two positive bounded operators on a Hilbert
spaceHk. Then
[A1⊗A2](B1⊗B2) = [A1]B1⊗[A2]B2.
The next proposition says that [ A]Badmits a very similar form to [6, Theorem 6].
Proposition 3.10. [A]Bis of the form

A,BB1/2=B1/21(0,∞)(I−YA,BY∗

Hence the desired assertion follows, since 1(0,∞)(I−YA,BY∗
A,B) is the orthogonal projection onto the
closed subspace {ξ∈ H;YA,BY∗
A,Bξ=ξ}⊥.
Using Lemma 2.7 with f(y) =1(0,∞)(1−y), we have

One of the main results of [1] is Theorem 5 there, which can be regar ded as an explicit description

Remark 3.12. The above lemma can be understood as various expressions of the p arallel sum. Namely,
A:B=B1/2(I−YA,BY∗
A,B)B1/2=A1/2(I−XA,BX∗
A,B)A1/2
=B1/2Y∗
A,BXA,BA1/2=A1/2X∗
A,BYA,BB1/2.
The proof is as follows. As in the proof of [2, Theorem 4.2], using a two -by-two matrix argument we
can show that
A1/2(I−X∗
A,BXA,B) =B1/2Y∗
A,BXA,B, A1/2XA,BY∗
A,B=B1/2(I−YA,BY∗
A,B).
On the other hand, since A:Bis given by the Pusz–Woronowicz functional calculus associated with
φ(x,y) =xy/(x+y), we have
A:B=φ(A,B) =T∗
A,Bφ(RA,B,SA,B)TA,B=T∗

Hence we can obtain the above expressions of the parallel sum.
The next lemma is due to Izumino [9, Lemma 2.3] (see also [2, Theorem 4 .2]), but we will give its
proof for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 3.13. ran((I−YA,BY∗
A,B)1/2) ={ξ∈ H;B1/2ξ∈ran(A1/2)}.
Proof.Since ran(T) = ran((TT∗)1/2) for any bounded operator T, we have, by Lemma 3.11,
ran(B1/2(I−YA,BY∗
A,B)1/2)
= ran((B1/2(I−YA,BY∗
A,B)B1/2)1/2)
= ran((A1/2(I−XA,BX∗
A,B)A1/2)1/2)
= ran(A1/2(I−XA,BX∗
A,B)1/2)⊆ran(A1/2).
Hence we have shown ( ⊆).
On the other hand, let ξ∈ Hbe such that B1/2ξ∈ran(A1/2). Then,B1/2ξ=A1/2ηfor some
η∈ H. Hence,T∗
A,BY∗
A,Bξ=T∗

Therefore,

A,B=YA,B(I−Y∗
A,BYA,B)Y∗
A,B= (I−YA,BY∗

Hence we obtain that

= ran((I−YA,BY∗
A,B)1/2(YA,BY∗

Thus we have shown ( ⊇). /square
The next proposition includes [1, Theorem 5].
Proposition 3.14. The range of PA,Bis exactly the closure of {ξ∈ H;B1/2ξ∈ran(A1/2)}. In
particular, the following are equivalent :
(1)B⋖A.
(2)B= [A]B.
(3)PA,B=I.
Proof.Note thatPA,B=1(0,∞)(I−YA,BY∗
A,B) is the orthogonal projection onto the ker( I−YA,BY∗
A,B)⊥.
Since ker(I−YA,BY∗
A,B) = ker((I−YA,BY∗
A,B)1/2), we have
ker(I−YA,BY∗
A,B)⊥= ker((I−YA,BY∗
A,B)1/2)⊥
=ran(I−YA,BY∗
A,B)1/2)
={ξ∈ H;B1/2ξ∈ran(A1/2)}
by Lemma 3.13.
(1)⇔(2): This follows from Proposition 3.7 ([ A]Bis the maximal A-absolutely continuous part) plus
Theorem 3.8.
(2)⇒(3): Proposition 3.10 shows that ( I−PA,B)B1/2=O. Hence (I−PA,B)ξ= 0 for every
ξ∈ran(B1/2) = ker(B1/2)⊥. Thanks to the ﬁrst part of assertion we see that ( I−PA,B)η= 0 for all
η∈ker(B1/2)⊆ran(PA,B). HencePA,B=I.
(3)⇒(2): This is trivial. /squareLEBESGUE DECOMPOSITION FOR POSITIVE OPERATORS 9

Ando [1, section 6] also gave a characterization of uniqueness of A-Lebesgue decomposition. His proof
can be regarded as an application of Proposition 3.14 and a theorem o f von Neumann (see [2, Theorem
3.6]). Hence we have successfully reconstructed Ando’s theory as well as Kosaki’s description of [ A]B[6,
Theorem 6].
4.Radon–Nikodym derivatives
Throughout this section, we will assume that Ais non-singular. Since A≤(A+B),HA,B=Hand
TA,B= (A+B)1/2hold under the assumption.
The ﬁrst lemma is essentially due to Kosaki [6, Lemma 3].
Lemma 4.1. LetB=Bc+Bsbe theA-Lebesgue decomposition of Bas in Proposition 3.6. Then the
quadratic form qon the Hilbert space Hwith domain D(q) = ran(A1/2)deﬁned by
q(A1/2ξ) =/bardblB1/2
cξ/bardbl2, ξ∈ H
becomes a closable positive quadratic form.
Proof.By theA-absolute continuity of Bc,A1/2ξ= 0 implies B1/2
cξ, that is, the above qis well-deﬁned.
Then the proof of (a) = ⇒(b) of [6, Lemma 3] shows that qis a closable. /square
Let ¯qbe the closure of the above q, and there is a unique positive self-adjoint operator DA,Bsuch that
dom(D1/2
A,B) =D(¯q), the domain of ¯ q, and ¯q(ξ) =/bardblD1/2
A,Bξ/bardbl2forξ∈ D(¯q). It is a standard fact that D(q)
is a core of D1/2
A,B.
Proposition 4.2. Z:=D1/2
A,BA1/2is a bounded operator on the Hilbert space HandZ∗Z=Bc.
Proof.Sinceran(A1/2)⊆ D(D1/2

theorem. Moreover, ( Z∗Zξ,ξ) =/bardblZξ/bardbl2=/bardblB1/2
cξ/bardbl2= (Bcξ,ξ) for allξ∈ H, and thusZ∗Z=Bc./square
The above proposition may be understood as an extension of the Do uglas decomposition theorem (see
e.g., [2, Theorem 2.1]), and the operator DA,Bmay be understood to play a role of Radon-Nikodym
derivative.

The above proof also shows the next corollary. The last part uses [5 , Lemma 2.5].
Corollary 4.4. The sequence hn(XA,BX∗
A,B)is monotone increasing and converges to an element of the
extended positive part /hatwiderB(H)+denoted by h(XA,BX∗
A,B). Then we have
Bc=Z∗Z= lim

A,B)A1/2=A1/2h(XA,BX∗

where the second equality is in the strong operator topology and the third equality is justiﬁed as elements
of/hatwiderB(H)+.
It is natural to regard h(XA,BX∗
A,B)∈/hatwiderB(H)+as a kind of Radon–Nikodym derivative for Bcwith
respect toA. We set the lower semi-continuous quadratic form pby
p(ξ) =/integraldisplay1

we have

Question 4.5. When does q=phold ?

as an attempt to write a PW-functional calculus operator to be of t he formA1/2(···)A1/2like Kubo–
Ando’s form of operator means/connections.
Proposition 4.6. Letφ(x,y)be a non-negative homogeneous Borel function on [0,∞)2that is bounded
on any compact subset. Assume that φ(x,y) = 0wheneverx= 0. Then, the PW-functional calculus
φ(A,B)isA-absolutely continuous and of the form

x1[1/n,1](x) onx∈[0,1]. Thenx(hφ)n(x)րφ(x,1−x)1(0,1](x) =φ(x,y)

ΓA,B(RA,B(hφ)n(RA,B))րΓA,B(φ(RA,B,SA,B)) =φ(A,B).
Henceφ(A,B)⋖A. Then we can apply the above discussion to φ(A,B) instead of Bc. /square

x1[1/n,1](x)րφ(x,1−x)
x1(0,1](x) =hφ(x) for allx∈[0,1], the above proof
shows that the sequence ( hφ)n(XA,BX∗

where the ﬁrst equation is in the strong operator topology and the second equation is understood as
elements of the extended positive part /hatwiderB(H)+.
In closing of this section, we should mention that the consideration h ere is related to Kosaki’s works
[6],[7, section 4] and [8], where more detailed analyses from the viewpo int of unbounded operators are
carried out. We regard Kosaki’s unbounded operator approach to Lebesgue decomposition as a kind of
attempt to develop Radon–Nikodym theorem for positive operator s.
Appendix A.A detailed account of Remark 2.5
We will give a detailed account about Remark 2.5. Let us consider φα(x,y) withα >1 andψ(x,y)
deﬁned by
φα(x,y) =

0 (x=y= 0),
∞ (x>0 =y),
(x/y)αy(otherwise) ,ψ(x,y) =

0 ( x=y= 0),
∞ (x>0 =y),
xlog(x/y) (otherwise) .
Then it is easy to conﬁrm that
φα(x1x2,y1y2) =φα(x1,y1)φα(x2,y2), ψ(x1x2,y1y2) =ψ(x1,y1)x2+x1ψ(x2,y2) (A.1)
hold for all ( x1,y1),(x2,y2)∈[0,∞)2.
For any (Ai,Bi)∈B(Hi)+×B(Hi)+,i= 1,2, we haveφα(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2),ψ(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2)∈
/hatwiderB(H1⊗H2)lbby PW-functional calculus developed in [5].
Proposition A.1. For anyρi∈B(Hi)+
∗,i= 1,2, we have
φα(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2)(ρ1⊗ρ2) =φα(A1,B1)(ρ1)φα(A2,B2)(ρ2),
ψ(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2)(ρ1⊗ρ2) =ψ(A1,B1)(ρ1)ρ2(A2)+ρ1(A1)ψ(A2,B2)(ρ2),(A.2)
whereρ1⊗ρ2is an element of B(H1⊗H2)+
∗viaB(H1⊗H2)∼=B(H1)⊗B(H2)as von Neumann algebra
tensor product.
Proof.The proof is essentially the same as that of Theorem 2.4, and we will pr ove only the second
formula.
We will use the notation in the proof of Theorem 2.4. We have

Assume further that the above Ai,Bi,i= 1,2, are of trace class. As in [5, Proposition 7.11] together
with (the proof of) [3, Proposition 1.10] we have
Tr(φα(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2)) = Tr(φα(A1,B1))Tr(φα(A2,B2)),
Tr(ψ(A1⊗A2,B1⊗B2)) = Tr(ψ(A1,B1))Tr(A2)+Tr(A1)Tr(ψ(A2,B2)).
These formulas are probably well known among specialists of quantu m information theory, and suggest
that PW-functionalcalculusis muchuseful totreatsomekinds ofb inaryoperationsforpositive operators.
In closing of this appendix, we would like to ask whether or not φα(A1⊗B1,A2⊗B2) andψ(A1⊗
B1,A2⊗B2) are uniquely determined by (A.2). We believe that this questionallows an aﬃrmativeanswer
from the viewpoint of tensor products of operator valued weights , but we have no proof about it at the
present moment.
Appendix B.Continuity of PW-functional calculus
We will reformulate the assertion of Theorem 3.8 in an abstract fash ion. Letφn(x,y) be a sequence
of extended real-valued homogeneous Borel functions over [0 ,∞)2, each of which is bounded from below
on any compact subsets, and let φ(x,y) be an extended real-valued homogeneous Borel functions over
[0,∞)2, which is bounded from below on any compact subsets. Assume that
lim
n→∞/integraldisplay1
0φn(x,1−x)ν(dx) =/integraldisplay1
0φ(x,1−x)ν(dx) (possibly + ∞= +∞)
for all ﬁnite Borel measures νon [0,1]. Then we have
φn(A,B)(ρ) =/integraldisplay1
0φn(x,1−x)(TA,BρT∗
A,B)(ERA,B(dx))
→/integraldisplay1
0φ(x,1−x)(TA,BρT∗
A,B)(ERA,B(dx)) =φ(A,B)(ρ)
asn→ ∞for allρ∈B(H)+
∗, whereERA,Bdenotes the spectral (projection-valued) measure of RA,B.
Now, we further suppose that all the φn(x,y) andφ(x,y) are bounded on any compact subsets. In
this case, all the φn(A,B) andφ(A,B) fall intoB(H). Assume here that φn(x,y)→φ(x,y) pointwisely
asn→ ∞and that
sup
nsup
x∈[0,1]|φn(x,1−x)|<+∞,
or equivalently, the φn(x,y) are bounded uniformly in non each compact subset thanks to the homo-
geneity. Then we have, by the bounded convergence theorem,
/bardbl(φn(RA,B,SA,B)−φ(RA,B,SA,B))ξ/bardbl2
HA,B
=/integraldisplay1
0|φn(x,1−x)−φ(x,1−x)|2/bardblERA,B(dx)ξ/bardbl2
HA,B→0
asn→ ∞for allξ∈ HA,B. By Remarks 2.3(2) we obtain that φn(A,B) = ΓA,B(φn(RA,B,SA,B))→
ΓA,B(φ(RA,B,SA,B)) =φ(A,B) in the strong operator topology as n→ ∞. This is indeed an abstraction
of Theorem 3.8.
