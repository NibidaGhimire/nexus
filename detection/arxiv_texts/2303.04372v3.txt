Abstract
Leo Creedon and Kieran Hughes in [ 18] studied derivations of a group ring RG(of
a group Gover a commutative unital ring R) in terms of generators and relators of
groupG. In this article, we do that for ( σ,τ)-derivations. We develop a necessary
and suﬃcient condition such that a map f:X→RGcan be extended uniquely to
a (σ,τ)-derivation DofRG, whereRis a commutative ring with unity, Gis a group
having a presentation /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tX|Y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht(Xthe set of generators and Ythe set of relators) and
(σ,τ) is a pair of R-algebra endomorphisms of RGwhich are R-linear extensions of
the group endomorphisms of G. Further, we classify all inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of the
group algebra RGof an arbitrary group Gover an arbitrary commutative unital ring R
in terms of the rank and a basis of the corresponding R-module consisting of all inner
(σ,τ)-derivations of RG. We obtain several corollaries, particularly when Gis a (σ,τ)-
FC group or a ﬁnite group Gand when Ris a ﬁeld. We also prove that if Ris a unital
ring and Gis a group whose order is invertible in R, then every ( σ,τ)-derivation of RG
is inner. We apply the results obtained above to study σ-derivations of commutative
group algebras over a ﬁeld of positive characteristic and to classify all inner and outer
σ-derivations of dihedralgroupalgebras FD2n(D2n=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta,b|an=b2= 1,b−1ab=a−1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht,
n≥3) over an arbitrary ﬁeld Fof any characteristic. Finally, we give the applications
of these twisted derivations in coding theory by giving a for mal construction with
examples of a new code called IDD code.

1role in mathematics and physics. The theory of derivations has been developed in rings and
numerous algebras and helps to study and understand their struc ture. For example, BCI-
algebras [ 43], MV-algebras [ 33,44], Banach algebras [ 47], von Neumann algebras [ 12], incline
algebras that have many applications [ 34], lattices that are very important in ﬁelds such as
informationtheory: informationrecovery, informationaccessma nagement, andcryptanalysis
[13]. Diﬀerentiable manifolds, operator algebras, C∗-algebras, and representation theory of
Lie groups are being studied using derivations [ 35]. For a historical account and further
applications of derivations, we refer the reader to [ 10,25,42].
In this article, we consider the pure algebraic structure, namely, t he group ring and its
(σ,τ)-derivations which have numerous applications (see [ 1] and the references within). For
a history of group rings, we refer the reader to [ 40, Chapter 3], and for a history of deriva-
tions, we refer the reader to the survey articles [ 25,42]. The idea of an ( s1,s2)-derivation
was introduced by Jacobson [ 31]. These derivations were later on commonly called as ( σ,τ)-
or (θ,φ)-derivations. These have been highly studied in prime and semiprime r ings and
have been principally used in solving functional equations [ 12]. Twisted derivations have
numerous applications. Derivations, especially ( σ,τ)-derivations of group rings have various
applications in coding theory [ 18,19]. The explicit description of derivations is useful in
constructing codes (see [ 18]). They are used in multiplicative deformations and discretiza-
tions of derivatives that have many applications in models of quantum phenomena and the
analysis of complex systems and processes. They are extensively in vestigated in physics and
engineering. Using twisted derivations, Lie algebras are generalized to hom-Lie algebras, and
the central extension theory is developed for hom-Lie algebras an alogously to that for Lie
algebras. Just as Lie algebras were initially studied as algebras of der ivations, Hom-Lie alge-
bras were deﬁned as algebras of twisted derivations. The generaliz ations (deformations and
analogs) of the Witt algebra, the complex Lie algebra of derivations o n the algebra of Lau-
rent polynomials C[t,t−1] in one variable, are obtained using twisted derivations. Deformed
Witt and Virasoro-type algebras have applications in analysis, numer ical mathematics, al-
gebraic geometry, arithmetic geometry, number theory, and phy sics. We refer the reader to
[27,30,36,50] for details. Twisted derivations have been used to generalize Galois theory
over division rings and in the study of q-diﬀerence operators in number theory. For more
applications of ( σ,τ)-derivations, we refer the reader to [ 1] and the references within.
Derivations and ( σ,τ)-derivations of group rings (deﬁned purely algebraically) have not
received much attention. The study of derivations of group rings b egins with the paper
[51], where the author studies derivations of group rings of a ﬁnitely-g enerated, torsion-free,
nilpotent group Gover a ﬁeld F. For instance, it is shown that such group rings always
contain an outer derivation. She, using the notion of derivations of FG, proved that the
Krull dimension of such a group ring FGis ﬁnite and equals F-rank of GifGsatisﬁes
certain additional conditions. In [ 52, Theorem 1], the main theorem of [ 52], it is proved that
every derivation of an integral group ring of a ﬁnite group is inner. I n [23, Theorem 1.1],
the main theorem of [ 23], the authors demonstrate that if Gis a torsion group whose center
Z(G) has a ﬁnite index in GandRis a semiprime ring such that char( R) is either 0 or does
not divide the order of any element of G, then every R-derivation of the group ring RGis
inner. In [ 15] and [16], the author generalizes the above results of [ 52] and [23] respectively
to (σ,τ)-derivations of group rings of ﬁnite groups over a ﬁeld and an integ ral domain where
σ,τsatisfy certain conditions. In [ 15], the author proves the following main theorem:
2Theorem 1.1 ([15, Theorem 1.1]) .LetGbe a ﬁnite group and Rbe an integral domain with
unity such that |G|is invertible in R. Letσ,τbeR-algebra endomorphisms of RGsuch that
they ﬁxZ(RG)elementwise.
(i) IfRis a ﬁeld, then every (σ,τ)-derivation of RGis inner.
(ii) IfRis an integral domain which is not a ﬁeld and if σ,τareR-linear extensions of
the group homomorphisms of G, then every (σ,τ)-derivation of RGis inner.
She also gives the following as a corollary of the above theorem. If Gis a ﬁnite group, R=Z
andσ,τsatisfy the conditions of part (ii) of the above theorem, then ever y (σ,τ)-derivation
ofZGis inner. In [ 16, Theorem 1.1], the main theorem of [ 16], the author proved that if
Ris a semiprime ring with unity such that either Rdoes not have torsion elements or that
ifRhasp-torsion elements, then pdoes not divide |G|, whereGis a torsion group such
that [G:Z(G)]<∞and ifσ,τareR-algebra endomorphisms of RGwhich ﬁx Z(RG)
elementwise, then there is a ring Tsuch that R⊆T,Z(R)⊆Z(T) and for the natural
extensions of σ,τtoTG,H1(TG,σTGτ) ={0}, the degree 1 Hochschild cohomology, that
is, there exists a ring extension Tof the semiprime ring Rsuch that all ( σ,τ)-derivations
ofTGare inner for the natural extensions σ,τtoTG. A. A. Arutyunov, in his several
papers ([ 1,3,4,5,6,8,9]), studies ordinary and twisted derivations using topology and
characters. For details, we refer the reader to the end of Subse ctions3.4and4.2, where we
have highlighted the work done in these papers. In [ 2], the authors considered the group ring
of a group Gover a unital ring Rsuch that all prime divisors of orders of elements in Gare
invertible in R. They proved that if Ris ﬁnite and Gis a torsion FC-group, all derivations
ofRGare inner. They obtained similar results for other classes of groups Gand rings R. In
[18], the authors studied the derivations of group rings over a commut ative unital ring Rin
terms of the generators and relators of the group. In [ 18, Theorem 2.5], which is the main
theorem of their article, the authors gave a necessary and suﬃcie nt condition under which
a map from the generating set of the group Gto the group ring RGcan be extended to a
derivation of RG. Applying this characterization, the authors in [ 18, Theorem 3.4] classiﬁed
the ordinary derivations of commutative group algebras over a ﬁeld of prime characteristic p
by giving the dimension and a basis for the vector space of all derivat ions over the underlying
ﬁeld of prime characteristic. In [ 18, Theorem 3.11 and Theorem 3.13], the authors also gave
an explicit description of the ordinary derivations and ordinary inner derivations of dihedral
group algebras over a ﬁeld of characteristic 2. In our article, we st udy the problems or
questions for more generalized ( σ,τ)-derivations of group rings. This paper will work with
(σ,τ)-derivationsandinner ( σ,τ)-derivations ofgroupalgebrasover arbitrarycharacteristics.
In this article, we also consider another problem, namely, the twiste d derivation problem.
The derivation problem for group rings asks if all the derivations in a g roup ring are inner
or if the space of outer derivations is trivial. We refer the reader to [1,4,7,8] for the history
and importance of the derivation problem. In this article, we conside r the analogousproblem
for (σ,τ)-derivations.
We have divided the manuscript into seven sections. Section 2states some basic deﬁni-
tions and facts. In Section 3, we study ( σ,τ)-derivations of a group ring RGof a group G
over a commutative unital ring Rin terms of the generators and relators of group G. The
section has been further subdivided into four subsections. In Sub section3.1, we state and
3prove useful results that we will need later in the proof of the sect ion’s main Theorems 3.4
and3.6. In Subsection 3.2, we prove the main Theorem 3.4forσ-derivations with the help
of a crucial Lemma 3.3. In Subsection 3.3, we generalize the results of Subsection 3.2to
(σ,τ)-derivations. We prove the main Theorem 3.6with the help of an important Lemma
3.5. The basic idea for proofs of Theorems 3.4and3.6is from [18]. However, the use of the
universal property of free groups in our proofs of the main theor ems of Section 3makes the
proofs diﬀerent from those of [ 18]. We will see that the universal property of free groups
plays a crucial role in the proof of the main theorems (Theorems 3.4and3.6) of this section.
In Subsection 3.4, we apply the results obtained in studying σ-derivations of commutative
group algebras.
InSection 4, we study theinner ( σ,τ)-derivationsofgroupalgebras. Wedothatusing the
notion of doubly-twisted conjugacy classes, namely, ( σ,τ)-conjugacy classes, which extend
the concept of usual conjugacy classes in classic group theory wh enσ=id=τ. The notion
of twisted conjugacy classes in group theory was introduced in the twentieth century. In
Subsection 4.1, weobserve someresults andterminologiesbasedondoubly-twiste d conjugacy
classes analogous to that in classical group theory. In Subsection 4.2, we obtain the main
results of the section. In the section’s main theorem, namely, Theo rem4.13, we classify
all inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of the group ring RGof an arbitrary group Gover an arbitrary
commutativeunitalring Rbyﬁndingtherankofthe R-moduleInn (σ,τ)(FG)ofallinner( σ,τ)-
derivations and a basis of it. Before this, no result seems to be availa ble in the literature
that classiﬁes all inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of the group algebra RGof an arbitrary group G
over an arbitrary commutative unital ring R. We obtain several corollaries of Theorem 4.13.
Corollary 4.14is stated for the inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of RGwhenGis a (σ,τ)-FC group.
Corollary 4.15is stated for the inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of RGwhenGis a ﬁnite group.
Corollary 4.16is stated for the inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of RG, whenRis a ﬁeld and Gis
a ﬁnite group. In Theorem 4.17, we prove that every ( σ,τ)-derivation of RGis an inner
(σ,τ)-derivation if Ris a unital ring and Gis a ﬁnite group whose order is invertible in R.
Corollary 4.18is one of the consequences of Corollary 4.15and Theorem 4.17.
In Section 5, we study the application of the results obtained in Sections 3and4in
classifying all inner and outer σ-derivations of the dihedral group algebra FD2n(n≥3)
over an arbitrary ﬁeld Fof any characteristic. Describing the derivation algebra consisting
of the derivations of group algebra is a well-known problem. This sect ion describes the σ-
derivation algebras of dihedral group algebras over an arbitrary ﬁ eld. For this, we subdivide
the section into four subsections. In Subsection 5.1, we consider the group algebra FD2nof
D2nover a ﬁeld Fof characteristic 0 or an odd rational prime p. We classify all σ-derivations
ofFD2nexplicitly by providing the dimension and an F-basis of the σ-derivation algebra
Dσ(FD2n). In Subsection 5.2, we do the same for the group algebra FD2nofD2nover a ﬁeld
Fof characteristic 2. In Subsection 5.1, we determine all σ-conjugacy classes of D2n. In
Subsection 5.4, we classify all inner and outer σ-derivations of FD2nover an arbitrary ﬁeld F
thus solving the σ-twisted derivation problem for dihedral group algebras over an ar bitrary
ﬁeld. This section thus illustrates how important the results of Sect ions3and4are in the
theory of twisted derivations of group rings.
In Section 6, we discuss the applications of our results in coding theory. We give t he
notion of a new code in coding theory, namely, an Image of Derivation -Derived (IDD) code.
We give the deﬁnition and construction and illustrate via some example s. Finally, in Section
47, we conclude our ﬁndings.
2 Basic Deﬁnitions
Below, we state some common knowledge. Let Rbe a commutative unital ring and Abe an
associative R-algebra. Let ( σ,τ) be a pair of R-algebra endomorphisms of A.
Deﬁnition 2.1. AnR-linear map d:A → Athat satisﬁes d(αβ) =d(α)β+αd(β)for all
α,β∈ A, is called a derivation of A. It is called inner if there exists some β∈ Asuch that
d(α) =βα−αβfor allα∈ A, and then we denote it by dβ. The elements of the quotient of
theR-module of all derivations of Aby theR-submodule of all inner derivations are called
outer derivations.
Deﬁnition 2.2. A(σ,τ)-derivation D:A → Ais anR-linear map that satisﬁes the (σ,τ)-
twisted generalized identity: D(αβ) =D(α)τ(β) +σ(α)D(β)for allα,β∈ A. It is called
inner if there exists some β∈ Asuch that D(α) =βτ(α)−σ(α)βfor allα∈ A, and then
we denote it by Dβ. The elements of the quotient of the R-module of all (σ,τ)-derivations
ofAby theR-submodule of all inner (σ,τ)-derivations are called outer (σ,τ)-derivations.
Deﬁnition 2.3. Ifτ=σ, then the generalized identity becomes D(αβ) =D(α)σ(β) +
σ(α)D(β); and for the sake of convenience, we call this (σ,σ)-derivation as a σ-derivation.
Aσ-derivation D:A → Ais called an inner σ-derivation if there exists some β∈ Asuch
thatD(α) =βσ(α)−σ(α)βfor allα∈ A. The elements of the quotient of the R-module
of allσ-derivations of Aby theR-submodule of all inner σ-derivations are called outer
σ-derivations.
Notation 2.4. We denote the set of all (σ,τ)-derivations on AbyD(σ,τ)(A), the set of all
σ-derivations on AbyDσ(A)and the set of all ordinary derivations on AbyD(A). We
denote the corresponding set of inner (σ,τ)-derivations, inner σ-derivations and ordinary
inner derivations on Aby Inn (σ,τ)(A), Innσ(A)and Inn(A)respectively. We denote the cor-
responding set of outer (σ,τ)-derivations, outer σ-derivations and ordinary outer derivations
onAby Out (σ,τ)(A), Outσ(A)and Out(A)respectively.
Remark 2.5. Ifσ=τ=idA(the identity map on A), then the usual Leibniz identity
holds, and (σ,τ)-derivation, inner (σ,τ)-derivation, and outer (σ,τ)-derivation respectively
become the ordinary derivation, ordinary inner derivation and ordinary outer derivation on
A. Deﬁning componentwise sum and module action, D(σ,τ)(A)becomes an R- as well as
A-module, and Inn (σ,τ)(A)become its submodule. If 1is the unity in AandDis a(σ,τ)-
derivation of A, thenD(1) = 0.
In view of the the above Deﬁnition 2.2and the Remark 2.5, the outer ( σ,τ)-derivations
are precisely the elements of the factor module Out (σ,τ)(A) =D(σ,τ)(A)
Inn(σ,τ)(A). Also, note that the
setD(σ,τ)(A)\Inn(σ,τ)(A) is the set of all non-inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of A. The following
lemma establishes a connection between our notions of outer ( σ,τ)-derivations and non-inner
(σ,τ)-derivations of A.
5Lemma 2.6. LetT={Di∈ D(σ,τ)(A)|i∈I}(Isome indexing set) be a left transversal
of Inn (σ,τ)(A)inD(σ,τ)(A)with0as the coset representative of the coset Inn (σ,τ)(A). Then
the non-inner (σ,τ)-derivations of Acorrespond to the elements in the set/uniontext
Di∈T\{0}(Di+
Inn(σ,τ)(A)). More precisely, D(σ,τ)(A)\Inn(σ,τ)(A) =/uniontext
Di∈T\{0}(Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A)).
Proof.LetD∈ D(σ,τ)(A)\Inn(σ,τ)(A). Then D∈ D(σ,τ)(A) butD /∈Inn(σ,τ)(A). This
implies that D+ Inn(σ,τ)(A)/\e}atio\slash= Inn (σ,τ)(A) so that D+ Inn(σ,τ)(A) =Di+ Inn(σ,τ)(A) for
someDi∈T\ {0}. Therefore, D−Di∈Inn(σ,τ)(A) so that D−Di=D0for some
D0∈Inn(σ,τ)(A). Finally, we get that D=Di+D0so thatD∈Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A). Hence, D∈/uniontext
Di∈T\{0}(Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A)). Therefore, D(σ,τ)(A)\Inn(σ,τ)(A)⊆/uniontext
Di∈T\{0}(Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A)).
Conversely, let D∈/uniontext
Di∈T\{0}(Di+ Inn (σ,τ)(A)). SoD∈Di+ Inn (σ,τ)(A) for some
Di∈T\{0}. SoD+Inn(σ,τ)(A) =Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A). But since Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A)/\e}atio\slash= Inn(σ,τ)(A),
soD+Inn(σ,τ)(A)/\e}atio\slash= Inn(σ,τ)(A) so that D /∈Inn(σ,τ)(A), that is, D∈ D(σ,τ)(A)\Inn(σ,τ)(A).
Therefore,/uniontext
Di∈T\{0}(Di+Inn(σ,τ)(A))⊆ D(σ,τ)(A)\Inn(σ,τ)(A).
Remark 2.7. In view of Lemma 2.6,Dis a non-inner derivation of Aif and only if
D+Inn(σ,τ)(A)is a non-zero element of Out (σ,τ)(A) =D(σ,τ)(A)
Inn(σ,τ)(A). In other words, Dis a
non-inner derivation of Aif and only if D+Inn(σ,τ)(A)is a non-trivial outer derivation of
A. Therefore, studying the non-trivial outer derivations of Ais equivalent to studying the
non-inner derivations of A(see [45, Chapter 11] for details).
Manyauthorshavedeﬁnedanouterderivationofaring R(oralgebra A)tobeanon-inner
derivationof R(orA). Somereferencesinthisregardare[ 11,17,20,22,26,39,46,49,53]. In
[9] and[41], theauthorsinitially describe the set D(A)\Inn(A)astheset ofouter derivations
but then argue that it is more natural to call the quotient module Ou t(A) =D(A)
Inn(A)as the set
of outer derivations because this module can be interpreted as 1stHochschild cohomology
module of Awith coeﬃcients in A. Similarly, the quotient module Out (σ,τ)(A) =D(σ,τ)(A)
Inn(σ,τ)(A)
is our set of outer ( σ,τ)-derivations because this module can be interpreted as 1st(σ,τ)-
Hochschild cohomology module of Awith coeﬃcients in A(see [30]).
Deﬁnition 2.8. Aissaid to be (σ,τ)-diﬀerentiallytrivial if Ahas onlyzero (σ,τ)-derivation,
that is,D(σ,τ)(A) ={0}.
Deﬁnition 2.9. IfRis a ring and Gis a group, then the group ring of GoverRis deﬁned
as the set
RG={/summationdisplay
g∈Gagg|ag∈R,∀g∈Gand|supp(α)|<∞},
where for α=/summationtext
g∈Gagg, supp(α)denotes the support of αthat consists of elements from
Gthat appear in the expression of α. The set RGis a ring concerning the componentwise
addition and multiplication deﬁned respectively by: For α=/summationtext

RG,

If the ring Ris commutative having unity 1and the group Gis abelian having identity e,
thenRGbecomes a commutative unital algebra over Rwith identity 1 = 1e. We adopt the
convention that empty sums are 0, and empty products are 1.
63(σ,τ)-Derivations of Group Rings
In this section, we establish a necessary and suﬃcient condition on a mapf:X→RG
such that fcan be extended to a ( σ,τ)-derivation of the group ring RG, whereXis a set of
generators of group G,Ris a commutative unital ring and ( σ,τ) is a pair of unital (map the
unity to itself) R-algebra endomorphisms of RGthat are R-linear extensions of the group
endomorphisms of G. However, we ﬁrst obtain the results for the case τ=σ. Then, we
use this to classify all σ-derivations of a commutative group algebra over a ﬁeld of positive
characteristic.
3.1 Some Useful Results
We will use the universal property of free groups in the proof of ou r main Theorems 3.4and
3.6.
Theorem 3.1. (Universal Property of a Free Group): Let Xbe an alphabet and F(X)be
the free group on the alphabet X. LetGbe a group and f:X→Gbe a set function. Then
there exists a unique group homomorphism ˜f:F(X)→Gsuch that the following diagram
commutes:
X F (X)
Gi
f˜f
wherei:X→F(X)is the inclusion map, that is, ˜f(x) =f(x)for allx∈X.
Lemma 3.2. LetAbe an associative algebra with unity over a unital ring R, and let σ
andτbe two algebra endomorphisms of Awhich map unity 1ofAto1itself. Let Dbe a
(σ,τ)-derivation of A. Then

thenD(αk) =k(σ(α))k−1D(α).
(v)D(αk) =k(σ(α))k−1D(α)for anyαwhich is a unit in Asuch that σ(α)commutes

Proof.(i)We prove the equality by using induction on k. Fork= 1, the left side is D(α1)

Therefore, by induction, the result holds for all k∈N.

i=0(σ(α))iD(α)(τ(α))r−1−i.
(iv)Letα∈ Asuch that σ(α) andτ(α) commute with D(α). Then by (ii),

D(α) =k(σ(α))k−1D(α).
(v)Letαbe a unit in Asuch that σ(α) andD(α) commute with each other. The result
holds for all k∈Nby (iv). For k= 0,D(α0) =D(1) = 0 and the right side is trivially 0
being an empty sum. So, the equality also holds for k= 0.
We have
σ(α−1)D(α) =σ(α−1)D(α)σ(αα−1) =σ(α−1)σ(α)D(α)σ(α−1) =D(α)σ(α−1).
Therefore, α−1is also a unit in Asuch that σ(α−1) andD(α) commute with each other.
Thus,
0 =D(1) =D(α−1α) =D(α−1)σ(α)+σ(α−1)D(α)
so thatD(α−1) =−σ(α−2)D(α).Further,
σ(α−1)D(α−1) =σ(α−1)(−σ(α−2)D(α)) = (−σ(α−2)D(α))σ(α−1) =D(α−1)σ(α−1).
Now, by (iv), we have that for any k∈N,
D(α−k) =D((α−1)k)
=k(σ(α−1))k−1D(α−1)
=k(σ(α))−k+1(−(σ(α))−2D(α))
=−k(σ(α))−k−1D(α).
Therefore, the result in (v) is true for all k∈Z.
83.2 The Main Theorem for σ-Derivations
Lemma 3.3. LetG=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tX|Y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htbe a group with Xas its set of generators and Yas its set
of relators. Let Rbe a commutative unital ring, σbe anR-algebra endomorphism of RG,
and anR-linear extension of a group endomorphism of G. LetF(X)be the free group on
X. Then any map f:X→RGcan be extended uniquely to a map ˜f:F(X)→RGsuch
that
˜f(vw) =˜f(v)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w),∀v,w∈F(X), (3.1)
where˜σ:F(X)→Gis the unique group homomorphism such that ˜σ(x) =σ(x)for all
x∈X.
Proof.By Theorem 3.1,σcan be extended uniquely to a group homomorphism ˜ σ:F(X)→
Gsuch that ˜ σ(x) =σ(x) for allx∈X. PutX−1={x−1|x∈X}. Then for any x∈X,
1 = ˜σ(1) = ˜σ(x)˜σ(x−1) =σ(x)˜σ(x−1)
so that ˜σ(x−1) =σ(x−1). Therefore, ˜ σ(g) =σ(g) for allg∈G.

=˜f(v)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w).
Therefore, ˜fsatisﬁes ( 3.1).
For any word wonX, letwdenote the reduced word on X. To show that the map ˜fis
well-deﬁned, it must be shown that ˜f(w) =˜f(w) for all words wonX.
Using (3.1) and (3.2), note that for any x∈X,
˜f(xx−1) =˜f(x)˜σ(x−1)+ ˜σ(x)˜f(x−1) =f(x)σ(x−1)−σ(x)σ(x−1)f(x)σ(x−1) = 0.
9Similarly, for any x∈X−1,˜f(xx−1) = 0. Therefore, for any two words vandwonXand
for anyx∈X∪X−1,
˜f(vxx−1w) =˜f(v)˜σ(xx−1w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(xx−1w)
=˜f(v)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)(˜f(xx−1)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(xx−1)˜f(w))
=˜f(v)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(xx−1)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w)
=˜f(v)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w)
=˜f(vw).
Therefore, ˜f(w) =˜f(w) for all words wonX.
Now, it remains to show the uniqueness of ˜f. If possible, suppose that ˜ g:F(X)→RG
is another extension of fdiﬀerent from ˜fthat satisﬁes
˜g(vw) = ˜g(v)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜g(w)
for allv,w∈F(X).
Note that
˜g(1) = ˜g(1)˜σ(1)+ ˜σ(1)˜g(1) = ˜g(1)+ ˜g(1)
so that ˜g(1) = 0. Therefore, ˜ g(1) = 0 = ˜f(1).
Again, since ˜fand ˜gare extensions of f:X→RG, therefore,
˜g(x) =f(x) =˜f(x)
for allx∈X.
Further, for any x∈X,
0 = ˜g(1) = ˜g(xx−1) = ˜g(x)˜σ(x−1)+ ˜σ(x)˜g(x−1)
so that
˜g(x−1) =−σ(x−1)f(x)σ(x−1) =˜f(x−1).
Therefore, ˜ g(x) =˜f(x) for allx∈X∪X−1.
Since ˜g/\e}atio\slash=˜f, so there exists some w0∈F(X) such that ˜ g(w0)/\e}atio\slash=˜f(w0) and ˜g(w) =˜f(w)
for all words w∈F(X) whose length is strictly less than that of w0. Now, as w0∈F(X),
sow0=/producttextm0
i=1xifor some xi∈X∪X−1(1≤i≤m0), where m0is the length of the word
w0. Since/producttextm0−1
i=1xj,xm0∈F(X) such that their lengths are strictly less than the length m0
ofw0, so by our choice of w0,
˜g(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj) =˜f(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj) and ˜ g(xm0) =˜f(xm0).
This gives
˜g(w0) = ˜g(m0/productdisplay
i=1xi) = ˜g((m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xi)xm0)
10= ˜g(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜σ(xm0)+ ˜σ(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜g(xm0)
=˜f(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜σ(xm0)+ ˜σ(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜f(xm0)
=˜f(m0/productdisplay
i=1xi) =˜f((m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xi)xm0)
=˜f(w0)
But this is a contradiction to the fact that ˜ g(w0)/\e}atio\slash=˜f(w0). Therefore, ˜fis the unique
extension of f:X→RGfromF(X) toRGthat satisﬁes ( 3.1).
Theorem 3.4. Under the hypotheses of Lemma 3.3, a mapf:X→RGcan be extended to
aσ-derivation DofRGif and only if ˜f(y) = 0for ally∈Y.
Proof.First, suppose that the given map f:X→RGcan be extended to a σ-derivation D
ofRG. SoD(x) =f(x) for allx∈X. Also, for any x∈X,
0 =D(1) =D(xx−1) =D(x)σ(x−1)+σ(x)D(x−1)
so that
D(x−1) =−σ(x−1)D(x)σ(x−1) =−σ(x−1)f(x)σ(x−1) =˜f(x−1).
Therefore, D(x) =˜f(x) for allx∈X∪X−1.
Now, let y∈Y. Theny=/producttextk
i=1yifor some yi∈X∪X−1(1≤i≤k). By (3.3) and
Lemma3.2(i),
˜f(y) =˜f(k/productdisplay
i=1yi) =k/summationdisplay
i=1/parenleftigg/parenleftiggi−1/productdisplay
j=1σ(yj)/parenrightigg

j=1σ(yj)/parenrightigg
D(yi)/parenleftiggk/productdisplay
j=i+1σ(yj)/parenrightigg/parenrightigg
=D(k/productdisplay
i=1yi) =D(y) =D(1) = 0.
Therefore, ˜f(y) = 0 for all y∈Y.
Conversely, assume that ˜f(y) = 0 for all y∈Y. Note that ˜ σ(y) =σ(y) = 1 for all y∈Y.
Therefore, for any y∈Y,
0 =˜f(1) =˜f(yy−1) =˜f(y)˜σ(y−1)+ ˜σ(y)˜f(y−1) =˜f(y−1).
Therefore, ˜f(y−1) = 0 for all y∈Y.
LetYF(X)be the normal closure of YinF(X). Then
YF(X)=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw−1yw|w∈F(X),y∈Y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht
11and it is the kernel of the unique onto group homomorphism φ:F(X)→Gwhich is the
identity on X, that is, G∼=F(X)
YF(X). Letε∈ {1,−1}. Then using ( 3.1) and the fact that
˜f(yε) = 0 for all y∈Y, we get that for any w∈F(X),
˜f(w−1yεw) =˜f(w−1)˜σ(yεw)+ ˜σ(w−1)˜f(yεw)
=˜f(w−1)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(w−1)(˜f(yε)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(yε)˜f(w))
=˜f(w−1)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(w−1)˜f(w)
=˜f(w−1w) =˜f(1) = 0.
Now, let v∈YF(X). Then v=/producttextm
i=1w−1
iyε
iwifor some m∈N,wi∈F(X),yi∈Y
(1≤i≤m). As shown above, the result holds for m= 1. Assume that the result holds for
m=k−1, that is, ˜f(/producttextk−1
i=1w−1
iyε
iwi) = 0. Then using ( 3.3) and the induction hypothesis,
we get that for m=k,
˜f(v) =˜f(k/productdisplay
i=1w−1
iyε
iwi) =˜f((k−1/productdisplay
i=1w−1

i=1w−1
iyε
iwi)0 = 0.
Therefore, ˜f(v) = 0 for all v∈YF(X). Also, ˜σ(v) = 1 for all v∈YF(X). Therefore, for any
w∈F(X) andv∈YF(X),
˜f(wv) =˜f(w)˜σ(v)+ ˜σ(w)˜f(v) =˜f(w)1+ ˜σ(w)0 =˜f(w).
Letg∈Gandg=/producttextm
i=1xifor some m∈N,xi∈X∪X−1(1≤i≤m). Sogis a word
onXso thatg∈F(X). In fact, gis the reduced word in F(X) withφ(g) =g. Ifw∈F(X)
such that φ(w) =g, thenwis either equivalent to the reduced word gor the expression
forw(as a product of elements from X∪X−1) contains elements from YF(X). In any case,
˜σ(w) =σ(g).
Now, deﬁne D:G→RGby
D(g) =˜f(w)
where for g∈G,w∈F(X) is such that φ(w) =g. Such a wexists as φ:F(X)→Gis
an onto group homomorphism, or as explained in the above paragrap h, we can take w=g.
The map Dis well-deﬁned because as shown already, ˜f:F(X)→RGis a well-deﬁned map
with˜f(wv) =˜f(w) for allv∈YF(X).
Now, let g,h∈G. Then there exists some u,w∈F(X) such that
φ(u) =gandφ(w) =h.
Then
˜σ(u) =σ(g),˜σ(w) =σ(h) and φ(uw) =φ(u)φ(w) =gh.
12Therefore, by the deﬁnition of D,
D(g) =˜f(u), D(h) =˜f(w) and D(gh) =˜f(uw).
Finally, using ( 3.1), we get that
D(gh) =˜f(uw) =˜f(u)˜σ(w)+ ˜σ(u)˜f(w) =D(g)σ(h)+σ(g)D(h).
Therefore, D(gh) =D(g)σ(h)+σ(g)D(h) for allg,h∈G.
Now, extend D R-linearly to the whole of RG. We denote the extended map also by D.
So ifλ∈R, andα=/summationtext
g∈Gλgg,β=/summationtext
h∈Gµhh∈RGfor some λg,µh∈R(g,h∈G), then
D(α+β) =D(α)+D(β) andD(λα) =λD(α) asDis anR-linear map. Also,
D(αβ) =D((/summationdisplay
g∈Gλgg)(/summationdisplay
g∈Gµhh))
=D(/summationdisplay
g,h∈Gλgµh(gh)) =/summationdisplay
g,h∈GλgµhD(gh)
=/summationdisplay
g,h∈Gλgµh(D(g)σ(h)+σ(g)D(h))

g∈Gλgg)σ(/summationdisplay
h∈Gµhh)+σ(/summationdisplay
g∈Gλgg)D(/summationdisplay
h∈Gµhh)
=D(α)σ(β)+σ(α)D(β).
Therefore, Dis aσ-derivation of RGthat extends f:X→RGto the whole of RG.
Now, it remains to show the uniqueness of D. If possible, suppose that ˜D:RG→RG
with˜D/\e}atio\slash=Dis another σ-derivation of RGthat extends f:X→RG. Then there exists
someg0∈Gsuch that ˜D(g0)/\e}atio\slash=D(g0) and˜D(g) =D(g) for allg∈Gsuch that the length
ofgis strictly less than that of g0.
Note that D(1) = 0 = ˜D(1). Also, ˜D(x) =f(x) =D(x) for allx∈X. Now, for any
x∈X,
0 =˜D(1) =˜D(xx−1) =˜D(x)σ(x−1)+σ(x)˜D(x−1) =f(x)σ(x−1)+σ(x)˜D(x−1)
so that˜D(x−1) =−σ(x−1)f(x)σ(x−1) =˜f(x−1) =D(x−1).
We can write g0∈Gasg0=x0y0for some x0,y0∈Gsuch that the lengths of x0and
y0are strictly less than that of g0. Then in view of our assumption, ˜D(x0) =D(x0) and
˜D(y0) =D(y0). Therefore,
˜D(g0) =˜D(x0y0)
=˜D(x0)σ(y0)+σ(x0)˜D(y0)
=D(x0)σ(y0)+σ(x0)D(y0)
=D(x0y0)
13=D(g0).
But this is a contradiction to the fact that ˜D(g0)/\e}atio\slash=D(g0). Therefore, D:RG→RGis the
uniqueσ-derivation that extends the given map f:X→RG.
Hence proved.
3.3 The Main Theorem for (σ,τ)-Derivations
In this Subsection, we prove Lemma 3.3and Theorem 3.4, in general, for ( σ,τ)-derivations.
The idea of the proofs is almost similar, but we still provide the proofs for the sake of
completeness.
Lemma 3.5. LetG=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tX|Y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htbe a group with Xas its set of generators and Yas its set
of relators. Let Rbe a commutative unital ring, and σandτbeR-algebra endomorphisms
ofRG, which are R-linear extensions of group endomorphisms of G. LetF(X)be the free
group on X. Then any map f:X→RGcan be extended uniquely to a map ˜f:F(X)→RG
such that
˜f(vw) =˜f(v)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w),∀v,w∈F(X), (3.4)
where˜σ,˜τ:F(X)→Gare the unique group homomorphisms such that ˜σ(x) =σ(x)and
˜τ(x) =τ(x)for allx∈X.
Proof.By Theorem 3.1,σandτcan be extended uniquely to group homomorphisms ˜ σ:
F(X)→Gand ˜τ:F(X)→Gsuch that ˜ σ(x) =σ(x) and ˜τ(x) =τ(x) for allx∈X.
As shown in the proof of Lemma 3.3, ˜σ(g) =σ(g) for allg∈G. On similar lines, it can
be shown that ˜ τ(g) =τ(g) for allg∈G.

=˜f(v)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w).
14Therefore, ˜fsatisﬁes ( 3.4).
For any word wonX, letwdenote the reduced word on X. To show that the map ˜fis
well-deﬁned, it must be shown that ˜f(w) =˜f(w) for all words wonX.
Using (3.4) and (3.5), note that for any x∈X,
˜f(xx−1) =˜f(x)˜τ(x−1)+ ˜σ(x)˜f(x−1) =f(x)τ(x−1)−σ(x)σ(x−1)f(x)τ(x−1) = 0.
Similarly, for any x∈X−1,˜f(xx−1) = 0. Therefore, for any two words vandwonXand
for anyx∈X∪X−1,
˜f(vxx−1w) =˜f(v)˜τ(xx−1w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(xx−1w)
=˜f(v)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)(˜f(xx−1)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(xx−1)˜f(w))
=˜f(v)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(xx−1)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w)
=˜f(v)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜f(w)
=˜f(vw).
Therefore, ˜f(w) =˜f(w) for all words wonX.
Now, as in the proof of Lemma 3.3, we show the uniqueness of ˜f. If possible, suppose
that ˜g:F(X)→RGis another extension of fdiﬀerent from ˜fthat satisﬁes
˜g(vw) = ˜g(v)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(v)˜g(w)
for allv,w∈F(X).
Note that
˜g(1) = ˜g(1)˜τ(1)+ ˜σ(1)˜g(1) = ˜g(1)+ ˜g(1)
so that ˜g(1) = 0. Therefore, ˜ g(1) = 0 = ˜f(1).
Again, since ˜fand ˜gare extensions of f:X→RG, therefore,
˜g(x) =f(x) =˜f(x)
for allx∈X.
Further, for any x∈X,
0 = ˜g(1) = ˜g(xx−1) = ˜g(x)˜τ(x−1)+ ˜σ(x)˜g(x−1)
so that
˜g(x−1) =−σ(x−1)f(x)τ(x−1) =˜f(x−1).
Therefore, ˜ g(x) =˜f(x) for allx∈X∪X−1.
Following the steps as in the proof of Lemma 3.3, since ˜g/\e}atio\slash=˜f, so there exists some
w0∈F(X) such that ˜ g(w0)/\e}atio\slash=˜f(w0) and ˜g(w) =˜f(w) for all words w∈F(X) whose length
is strictly less than that of w0. Asw0∈F(X), sow0=/producttextm0
i=1xifor some xi∈X∪X−1
(1≤i≤m0), where m0is the length of the word w0. Since/producttextm0−1
i=1xj,xm0∈F(X) such
that their lengths are strictly less than the length m0ofw0, so by our choice of w0,
˜g(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj) =˜f(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj) and ˜ g(xm0) =˜f(xm0).
15This gives
˜g(w0) = ˜g(m0/productdisplay
i=1xi) = ˜g((m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xi)xm0)
= ˜g(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜τ(xm0)+ ˜σ(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜g(xm0)
=˜f(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜τ(xm0)+ ˜σ(m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xj)˜f(xm0)
=˜f(m0/productdisplay
i=1xi) =˜f((m0−1/productdisplay
i=1xi)xm0)
=˜f(w0).
But this is a contradiction to the fact that ˜ g(w0)/\e}atio\slash=˜f(w0). Therefore, ˜fis the unique
extension of f:X→RGfromF(X) toRGthat satisﬁes ( 3.4).
Theorem 3.6. Under the hypotheses of Lemma 3.5, a mapf:X→RGcan be extended to
a(σ,τ)-derivation DofRGif and only if ˜f(y) = 0for ally∈Y.
Proof.First, suppose that the given map f:X→RGcan be extended to a ( σ,τ)-derivation
DofRG. SoD(x) =f(x) for allx∈X. Also, for any x∈X,
0 =D(1) =D(xx−1) =D(x)τ(x−1)+σ(x)D(x−1)
so that
D(x−1) =−σ(x−1)D(x)τ(x−1) =−σ(x−1)f(x)τ(x−1) =˜f(x−1).
Therefore, D(x) =˜f(x) for allx∈X∪X−1.
Now, let y∈Y. Theny=/producttextk
i=1yifor some yi∈X∪X−1(1≤i≤k). By (3.6) and
Lemma3.2(i),
˜f(y) =˜f(k/productdisplay
i=1yi) =k/summationdisplay
i=1/parenleftigg/parenleftiggi−1/productdisplay
j=1σ(yj)/parenrightigg
˜f(yi)/parenleftiggk/productdisplay
j=i+1τ(yj)/parenrightigg/parenrightigg
=k/summationdisplay
i=1/parenleftigg/parenleftiggi−1/productdisplay
j=1σ(yj)/parenrightigg
D(yi)/parenleftiggk/productdisplay
j=i+1τ(yj)/parenrightigg/parenrightigg
=D(k/productdisplay
i=1yi) =D(y) =D(1) = 0.
Therefore, ˜f(y) = 0 for all y∈Y.
Conversely, assume that ˜f(y) = 0 for all y∈Y. Note that ˜ σ(y) =σ(y) = 1 and
˜τ(y) =τ(y) = 1 for all y∈Y. Therefore, for any y∈Y,
0 =˜f(1) =˜f(yy−1) =˜f(y)˜τ(y−1)+ ˜σ(y)˜f(y−1) =˜f(y−1).
16Therefore, ˜f(y−1) = 0 for all y∈Y.
As in the proof of Theorem 3.4, letYF(X)be the normal closure of YinF(X). Then
YF(X)=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tw−1yw|w∈F(X),y∈Y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htand it is the kernel of the unique onto group homo-
morphism φ:F(X)→Gwhich is identity on X, that is, G∼=F(X)
YF(X). Letε∈ {1,−1}. Then
using (3.4) and the fact that ˜f(yε) = 0 for all y∈Y, we get that for any w∈F(X),
˜f(w−1yεw) =˜f(w−1)˜τ(yεw)+ ˜σ(w−1)˜f(yεw)
=˜f(w−1)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(w−1)(˜f(yε)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(yε)˜f(w))
=˜f(w−1)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(w−1)˜f(w)
=˜f(w−1w) =˜f(1) = 0.
Now, let v∈YF(X). Thenv=/producttextm
i=1w−1

iwifor some m∈N,wi∈F(X),yi∈Y
(1≤i≤m). As shown above, the result holds for m= 1. Assume that the result holds for
m=k−1, that is, ˜f(/producttextk−1
i=1w−1
iyε
iwi) = 0. Then using ( 3.6) and the induction hypothesis,
we get that for m=k,
˜f(v) =˜f(k/productdisplay
i=1w−1
iyε
iwi) =˜f((k−1/productdisplay
i=1w−1

i=1w−1

iwi)0 = 0.
Therefore, ˜f(v) = 0 for all v∈YF(X). Also, ˜σ(v) = ˜τ(v) = 1 for all v∈YF(X). Therefore,
for anyw∈F(X) andv∈YF(X),
˜f(wv) =˜f(w)˜τ(v)+ ˜σ(w)˜f(v) =˜f(w)1+ ˜σ(w)0 =˜f(w).
Letg∈Gandg=/producttextm
i=1xifor some m∈N,xi∈X∪X−1(1≤i≤m). Sogis a word
onXso thatg∈F(X). In fact, gis the reduced word in F(X) withφ(g) =g. Ifw∈F(X)
such that φ(w) =g, thenwis either equivalent to the reduced word gor the expression
forw(as a product of elements from X∪X−1) contains elements from YF(X). In any case,
˜σ(w) =σ(g) and ˜τ(w) =τ(g).
Now, deﬁne D:G→RGby
D(g) =˜f(w)
where for g∈G,w∈F(X) is such that φ(w) =g. Such a wexists as φ:F(X)→Gis
an onto group homomorphism, or as explained in the above paragrap h, we can take w=g.
The map Dis well-deﬁned because as shown already, ˜f:F(X)→RGis a well-deﬁned map
with˜f(wv) =˜f(w) for allv∈YF(X).
Now, let g,h∈G. Then there exists some u,w∈F(X) such that
φ(u) =gandφ(w) =h.
17Then
˜σ(u) =σ(g),˜τ(w) =τ(h) and φ(uw) =φ(u)φ(w) =gh.
Therefore, by the deﬁnition of D,
D(g) =˜f(u), D(h) =˜f(w) and D(gh) =˜f(uw).
Finally using ( 3.4), we get that
D(gh) =˜f(uw) =˜f(u)˜τ(w)+ ˜σ(u)˜f(w) =D(g)τ(h)+σ(g)D(h).
Therefore, D(gh) =D(g)τ(h)+σ(g)D(h) for allg,h∈G.
Now, extend D R-linearly to the whole of RG. We denote the extended map also by D.
So ifλ∈R, andα=/summationtext
g∈Gλgg,β=/summationtext
h∈Gµhh∈RGfor some λg,µh∈R(g,h∈G), then
D(α+β) =D(α)+D(β) andD(λα) =λD(α) asDis anR-linear map. Also,
D(αβ) =D((/summationdisplay
g∈Gλgg)(/summationdisplay
g∈Gµhh))
=D(/summationdisplay
g,h∈Gλgµh(gh)) =/summationdisplay

h∈Gµhh)
=D(α)τ(β)+σ(α)D(β).
Therefore, Dis a (σ,τ)-derivation of RGthat extends f:X→RGto the whole of RG.
Now, it remains to show the uniqueness of D. If possible, suppose that ˜D:RG→RG
with˜D/\e}atio\slash=Dis another ( σ,τ)-derivation of RGthat extends f:X→RG. Then there exists
someg0∈Gsuch that ˜D(g0)/\e}atio\slash=D(g0) and˜D(g) =D(g) for allg∈Gsuch that the length
ofgis strictly less than that of g0.
Note that D(1) = 0 = ˜D(1). Also, ˜D(x) =f(x) =D(x) for allx∈X. Now, for any
x∈X,
0 =˜D(1) =˜D(xx−1) =˜D(x)τ(x−1)+σ(x)˜D(x−1) =f(x)τ(x−1)+σ(x)˜D(x−1)
so that˜D(x−1) =−σ(x−1)f(x)τ(x−1) =˜f(x−1) =D(x−1).
We can write g0∈Gasg0=x0y0for some x0,y0∈Gsuch that the lengths of x0and
y0are strictly less than that of g0. Then in view of our assumption, ˜D(x0) =D(x0) and
˜D(y0) =D(y0). Therefore,
˜D(g0) =˜D(x0y0)
=˜D(x0)τ(y0)+σ(x0)˜D(y0)
18=D(x0)τ(y0)+σ(x0)D(y0)
=D(x0y0)
=D(g0).
But this is a contradiction to the fact that ˜D(g0)/\e}atio\slash=D(g0). Therefore, D:RG→RGis the
unique (σ,τ)-derivation that extends the given map f:X→RG.
Hence proved.
Remark 3.7. The assumption that the ring Ris commutative is necessary in Theorem 3.6.
For example, let Rbe a non-commutative ring and a,b∈Rsuch that ab/\e}atio\slash=ba.
LetX={x,y}andG=F(X)be the free group on X.
Deﬁnef:X→RGby
f(x) =aandf(y) =b.
Deﬁne two group endomorphisms σandτofGby
σ(x) =x, σ(y) =yandτ(x) =y, τ(y) =x.
If possible, suppose that fcan be extended to a (σ,τ)-derivation DofRG. Then
D(xby) =D(bxy) =bD(xy)
=b(D(x)τ(y)+σ(x)D(y))
=b(f(x)τ(y)+σ(x)f(y))
=b(ax+xb) =bax+bxb
= (ba+b2)x
and
D(x)τ(by)+σ(x)D(by) =D(x)bτ(y)+σ(x)bD(y)
=f(x)bτ(y)+σ(x)bf(y)
=abx+xb2
= (ab+b2)x.
Sinceab/\e}atio\slash=ba, therefore, D(xby)/\e}atio\slash=D(x)τ(by)+σ(x)D(by). This gives a contradiction.
3.4 Application: σ-Derivations of Commutative Group Algebras
In this subsection, we apply the results of Subsection 3.2to classify the σ-derivations of
commutative group algebras. In this subsection, we assume that Ris a commutative unital
ring,Gis a group, and σis anR-algebra endomorphism of RGthat is an R-linear extension
of a group endomorphism of G.
Theorem 3.8. LetHbe a subgroup of Gsuch that σ(H) ={σ(h)|h∈H}is a torsion
central subgroup of Gand the order of every element of σ(H)is invertible in R. Then every
σ-derivation of RGis anRH-derivation, that is, D(RH) ={0}for allD∈ Dσ(RG).
19Proof.LetD∈ Dσ(RG) andh∈H. The order of σ(h) is ﬁnite, say, r, and is invertible in
R. Sinceσ(h) commutes with D(h), therefore, by Lemma 3.2(v),
0 =D(1) =D(hr) =r(σ(h))r−1D(h).
Sincer=|σ(h)|is invertible in Rand hence invertible in RG, we get that D(h) = 0 from
above. Therefore, D(h) = 0 for all h∈H.
Now, let α∈RH. Thenα=/summationtext
h∈Hλhhfor some λh∈R(h∈H). SinceDisR-linear,
so
D(α) =D(/summationdisplay
h∈Hλhh) =/summationdisplay
h∈HλhD(h) =/summationdisplay
h∈Hλh0 = 0.
Therefore, D(RH) ={0}.
Corollary 3.9. IfGis a ﬁnite abelian group and Fis a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, thenFG
has no non-zero σ-derivations.
Proof.Follows by taking H=Gin Theorem 3.8.
Note that Corollary 3.9is not a criterion. That is, if Fis any ﬁeld, Gis any group, and
σis any endomorphism of RG, which is an R-linear extension of a group endomorphism of
G, then it is not necessary that Gis a ﬁnite abelian group or Fis a ﬁeld of characteristic 0.
Below, we give some examples to illustrate this.
Examples 3.10and3.11illustrate the situation when FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations
andGis a ﬁnite abelian group, but ﬁeld Fis not of characteristic 0.
A subgroup Hof a group is said to be p-regular for a rational prime pif every element
ofHhas an order which is not a multiple of p.
Example 3.10. Letpandqbe two distinct rational primes. Let G=Cqt=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tx|xqt= 1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht
be a cyclic group of order qt(for some t∈N) andFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic p. ThenGis
ap-regular ﬁnite abelian group. Further, let σbe anF-algebra endomorphism of FGwhich
is anF-linear extension of a group endomorphism of G.
ThenbyTheorem 3.8, everyσ-derivationof FGisanFG-derivation,thatis, D(FG) ={0}
for allD∈ Dσ(RG). In other words, FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations.
Note that, here FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations and Gis a ﬁnite abelian group, but
the ﬁeld Fis not of characteristic 0; Fis a ﬁeld of characteristic p(odd rational prime).
The example below is a more generalized version of Example 3.10.
Example 3.11. Letp,q1,...,qs(s∈N) be distinct odd rational primes and t1,...,tsbe
positive integers. For each i∈ {1,...,s}, letCqti=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{txi|xti
i= 1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htdenote a cyclic group
of order qti. LetG=Cqt1×...×Cqtsbe a ﬁnite abelian group of order qt1...qts. ThenG
becomes a p-regular group. Further, let Fbe a ﬁeld of characteristic pandσbe anF-algebra
endomorphism of FGwhich is an F-linear extension of a group endomorphism of G.
ThenbyTheorem 3.8, everyσ-derivationof FGisanFG-derivation,thatis, D(FG) ={0}
for allD∈ Dσ(RG). In other words, FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations.
Again, note that FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations and Gis a ﬁnite abelian group, but
the ﬁeld Fis not of characteristic 0; Fis a ﬁeld of characteristic p(odd rational prime).
20Examples 3.12and3.13below illustrate the following two situations:
1.FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations and Fis a ﬁeld of characteristic 0, but the group G
is not ﬁnite abelian group.
2.FGhas no non-zero σ-derivations, but neither the ﬁeld Fis of characteristic 0 nor the
groupGis ﬁnite abelian.
Example 3.12. Consider the dihedral group D2n=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta,b|an= 1 =b2,(ab)2= 1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htof order
2n(n≥3) withnodd. Let Fbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 or an odd rational prime p.
The map σ−1:D2n→D2ngiven by σ−1(a) = 1 and σ−1(b) = 1 is the trivial group
endomorphism of D2n. Extend σ−1F-linearly to an F-algebra endomorphism of FD2n.
Sinceσ−1(b) =σ−1(ab) = 1∈D2n∩Z(FD2n), so by the note following Deﬁnition 5.1,
¯C(σ−1(b)) =¯C(σ−1(ab)) ={0}, where for any β∈FD2n,¯C(β) ={α∈FD2n|αβ=−βα}
denotes the anti-centralizer of βinFD2n(see Deﬁnition 5.1).
First, we determine Dσ−1(FD2n). For this, let f:X={a,b} →FD2nbe a map that can
be extended to a σ−1-derivation of FD2n. Then by Theorem 3.4, this happens if and only if
˜f(an) = 0,˜f(b2) = 0 and ˜f((ab)2) = 0,
where˜f:F(X)→FD2nis the unique extension of fdeﬁned in ( 3.2) and (3.3) and satisfying
(3.1), andF(X) is the free group on X.
As explained in the paragraph after the proof of Lemma 5.2,˜f(b2) = 0 if and only if
f(b)∈¯C(σ−1(b)), and˜f((ab)2) = 0 if and only if ˜f(ab)∈¯C(σ−1(ab)). But since ¯C(σ−1(b)) =
¯C(σ−1(ab)) ={0}, therefore, f(b) =˜f(ab) = 0.
Further, by ( 5.2),f(a) =˜f(ab)σ−1(b)−σ−1(a)f(b)σ−1(b). But since f(b) = 0 = ˜f(ab),
therefore, f(a) = 0.
Sincef(a) = 0 =f(b), therefore, FD2nhas no non-zero σ−1-derivations, that is,
Dσ−1(FD2n) ={0}. Therefore, FD2nhas no non-zero σ−1-derivations.
But note that here the group D2nis non-abelian. Also, the ﬁeld Fcan be of characteristic
either 0 or an odd rational prime p.
Example 3.13. Now, consider the dihedral group D2nwithneven and a ﬁeld Fof charac-
teristic 0 or an odd rational prime p.
As stated in Section 5, the map σ2:D2n→D2ndeﬁned by σ2=as(s= 0,n
2) and
σ2(b) =at(t= 0,n
2) is a group endomorphism of D2n. Extend σ2F-linearly to an F-algebra
endomorphism of FD2n.
Again, since σ2(b) =σ2(ab)∈D2n∩Z(FD2n), so by the note following Deﬁnition 5.1,
¯C(σ2(b)) =¯C(σ2(ab)) ={0}. Therefore, as shown in the above Example 3.12, it can be
shown on the similar lines that Dσ2(FD2n) ={0}. Therefore, FD2nhas no non-zero σ2-
derivations.
Again, notethatherethegroup D2nisnon-abelian, andtheﬁeld Fcanbeofcharacteristic
either 0 or an odd rational prime p.
The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.8, and generalizes
Examples 3.10and3.11.
21Corollary 3.14. LetGbe a ﬁnite abelian group and Hbe ap-regular subgroup of G, where
pis a rational prime. Let Fbe a ﬁeld of characteristic p. Then every σ-derivation of FGis
anFH-derivation.
By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, every ﬁnite A belian group G
is isomorphic to a direct product of a p-regular group and a p-group, where pis a rational
prime, that is, G∼=H×K, whereHis ap-regular group and Kis ap-group. The group K
then has the presentation K=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tX|Y/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht, whereX={x1,...,xr}is a set of generators of Kfor
somer∈NandY={xpri
i,x−1

jxixj,for some ri∈N, i∈ {1,...,r}}. Now, we have the
following theorem, which classiﬁes all σ-derivations of FG, whereFis a ﬁeld of characteristic
pandGis a ﬁnite abelian group in the above form.
Theorem 3.15. The dimension of Dσ(FG)isr|G|and a basis is
B={gDi|g∈G,1≤i≤r},
where for each i∈ {1,...,r},Di:FG→FGis aσ-derivation of FGdeﬁned by Di(xj) =δij,
the Kronecker delta.
Proof.By Corollary 3.14, everyσ-derivation of FGis anFH-derivation.
For each i∈ {1,...,r}, deﬁnefi:X→FGby
fi(xj) =δij,that is, fi(xj) =/braceleftigg

Then by Lemma 3.3, eachfican be extended uniquely to a map ˜fi:F(X)→FGthat

=−σ(x−1
k)fi(xk)−σ(x−1
l)fi(xl)+σ(x−1
k)fi(xk)+σ(x−1
l)fi(xl) = 0.
So we have proved that ˜fi(y) = 0 for all y∈Yandi∈ {1,...,r}. Therefore, by Theorem 3.4,
for eachi∈ {1,...,r}, the map fi:X→FGcan be extended uniquely to a σ-derivation Di
ofFG.
22PutB={gDi|g∈G,1≤i≤r}. We prove that Bis a basis of the F-vector space
Dσ(FG).
Since for each i∈ {1,...,r},Diis an extension of fi, therefore, Di(xj) =fi(xj) =δijfor
all 1≤i,j≤r.
Now, let D∈ Dσ(FG) andi,j∈ {1,...,r}. LetD(xj) =/summationtext

D(xj) =/summationdisplay

Further,

so that
Di(x−1
j) =−σ(x−1
j)Di(xj)σ(x−1
j) =−σ(x−2
j)Di(xj) =−σ(x−2

Similarly, D(x−1

Now, since Xis a generating set of the group K, therefore, for any g0∈G, asDis

Therefore, the set BspansDσ(FG) overF.
Now, assume that

g∈Gcjgg= 0
for all 1 ≤j≤r. This and the fact that Gis anF-linearly independent subset of FG
together imply that for all 1 ≤j≤r,cjg= 0 for all g∈G.
23Finally, we compare our results in this section with some of the earlier k nown results on
twisted derivations of commutative algebras. Before this, there h ave been several attempts
to describe the R-module of ordinary or twisted derivations of an R-algebra A(Ra ring).
Forexample, in[ 18, Subsection 3.1], theauthorsstudiedordinaryderivationsofcomm utative
group algebras. Subsection 3.4of our article generalizes the results of [ 18, Subsection 3.1] to
σ-derivations with a more elaborate and complete justiﬁcation. In [ 14], the author studied
(σ,τ)-derivations of commutative algebras over a commutative unital r ing. In [14, Theorem
3.1], theauthorstudiedtheuniversal mappingpropertiesof( σ,τ)-derivationsofcommutative
algebras over a commutative ring with unity. The author also studied the (σ,τ)-derivations
of the ring of algebraic integers, OK=Z[√
d] (da square-free integer) of a quadratic number
ﬁeldKby considering OKas a (commutative) Z-algebra. More precisely, in [ 14, Theorem
4.2], the author showed that if σ,τare two diﬀerent ring endomorphisms of OK, then any Z-
linearmap D:OK→OKwithD(1) = 0isa( σ,τ)-derivationof OK,andalsogaveasuﬃcient
condition under which a ( σ,τ)-derivation of OKis inner. These rings OKprovide several
examples of non-UFDs. In [ 52], the author described the derivations of ZGfor any abelian
groupG. In [16, Theorem 4.6], the author gives an element in RG(a commutative group
algebra of an abelian group Gover a commutative unital ring Rwith certain conditions) that
makes a ( σ,τ)-derivation of RGinner under the condition that there exists some b∈RG
with (τ−σ)(b) invertible in RG, whereσ,τareR-algebra endomorphisms of RG. In [48],
the authors proved that a certain bracket on the σ-derivations of a commutative algebra
preserves inner derivations (see Proposition 2.3.1), and based on t his obtained structural
results providing new insights into σ-derivations on Laurent polynomials in one variable,
C[t,t−1] which is a UFD. In [ 27], the authors developed an approach to deformations of the
Witt and Virasoro algebras based on twisted derivations. The autho rs proved that if A(an
algebra over C) is a unique factorization domain (UFD), then the A-module D(σ,idA)(A) of
all (σ,idA)-derivations of Ais a freeA-module of rank one. Here σandτare two diﬀerent
algebraendomorphisms of Aandthegeneratorisa( σ,τ)-derivationgivenby∆ =τ−σ
g, where
g= gcd((τ−σ)(A)) (see Theorem 4). The authors also deﬁned generalized Witt algeb ra
using a twisted derivation. In [ 48], the authors further noted that a ( σ,idA)-derivation a∆
is inner if and only if gdividesa. More precisely, the A-submodule of all inner ( σ,idA)-
derivations is of rank one with generator gA∆ (see Proposition 2.4.1). Then the authors
obtained some more deep and precise results for the algebra A=C[t,t−1], which is also
a UFD. Note that, in this article, we have considered our set of ( σ,τ)-derivations of the
group ring RG(Ra commutative unital ring, Ga group) as an R-module rather than an
RG-module.
There are several papers, especially by A. A. Arutyunov (as ment ioned in the Introduc-
tion Section 1), in which the description of the derivations of group algebras is give n. In
[1], the authors considered the ( σ,τ) and (σ,id)-derivations of the group algebra CGof a
discrete countable group G, whereσ,τareC-algebra endomorphisms of CGwhich are C-
linear extensions of the group endomorphisms of G. In [1, Theorem 4], the authors proved
a decomposition theorem expressing the C-vector space of all ( σ,τ)-derivations of CGof
a ﬁnitely generated ( σ,τ)-FC group, where a ( σ,τ)-FC group is a group in which every
(σ,τ)-conjugacy class is of ﬁnite size.
In [3], the authors studied the ordinary derivations of ﬁnite and FC grou ps using topo-
24logical and character techniques. They obtained decomposition th eorems for derivations of
the group ring AGof a ﬁnite group or FC group (a group in which every conjugacy class is of
ﬁnite size) Gover a commutative unital ring A(see [3, Theorems 3.2, 4.1]). More precisely,
the authors proved that for a ﬁnitely generated FC-group G, theA-module of all derivations
ofAGis isomorphic to the direct sum of its A-submodule of all inner derivations of AG
and/circleplustext
[u]∈GGHomAb(Z(u),A),where Hom Ab(Z(u),A) is the set of additive homomorphisms
from the centralizer Z(u) of a ﬁxed element u∈Gto the ring AandGGis the set of all
possible distinct conjugacy classes [ u] (u∈G) inG(see [3, Theorems 3.2]). Furthermore,
ifGis a ﬁnite group, then the A-module of all outer derivations of AGis isomorphic to/circleplustext
[u]∈GGHomAb(Z(u),A) (see [3, Theorems 4.1]).
In [4] also, a description of derivations is given in terms of characters of the groupoid of
the adjoint action of the group. A method of describing the space o f all outer derivations
of the complex group algebra CGof a ﬁnitely presentable discrete group Gis given. In [ 5],
the author studied derivations of a complex group algebra CGof a ﬁnitely generated group
G. The author constructed the ideals of inner and quasi-inner deriva tions and established
a connection between derivations and characters on the groupoid of the adjoint action (see
Proposition 2.11 and Corollary 3.2). The author described the space of outer and quasi-
outer derivations of CGusing the methods of combinatorial group theory, in particular, th e
number of ends of the group Gand the number of ends of the connected components of a
conjugacy diagram (see, for example, Theorem 3.6, Corollary 3.7, T heorem 4.2, Corollary
4.3, Corollary 4.5, Corollary 4.7, Proposition 5.1). In [ 6], the authors described the space
of all inner and outer derivations of a group algebra of a ﬁnitely pres ented discrete group
in terms of the character spaces of the 2-groupoid of the adjoint action of the group. In
[7], the author established a connection between derivations of comp lex group algebras and
the theory that studies the ends of topological spaces. In [ 7, Theorems 5 and 6], the author
described the space of outer and quasi-outer derivations of a com plex group algebra.
In [8], the author studied derivation spaces in the groupalgebra CGof a generally inﬁnite
non-commutative discrete group Gin terms of characters on a groupoid associated with the
group. In [ 8, Theorem 2], the author constructed a subalgebra of non-inner d erivations of
CG, which can be embedded in the algebra of all outer derivations. In [ 8, Theorem 3], the
author obtained the necessary conditions under which a characte r deﬁnes a derivation. In [ 8,
Proposition 8], the author described the space of all derivations of a complex group algebra
of a free abelian group of ﬁnite rank. In [ 8, Theorem 4 and Theorem 5], the author gave
an explicit description of the space of all derivations and outer deriv ations of the complex
group algebra of a rank two nilpotent group. In [ 9], the authors described the space of all
outer derivations of the group algebra CGof a ﬁnitely presented discrete group in terms
of the Cayley complex of the groupoid of the adjoint action of the gr oup (see Theorem 3,
Theorem 4, Corollary 1, Corollary 2). They showed that the space o f outer derivations is
isomorphic to the one-dimensional compactly supported group of t he Cayley complex over
C. In [41], the author studied the derivations of a complex group algebra CGof a ﬁnitely
generated discrete group. In [ 41, Section 3], the author described the derivations of CG
using characters on the groupoid of the adjoint action of the grou p (see Theorems 2 and 3).
In [41, Section 4], the author described the space of outer derivations b y establishing the
isomorphism of this space with the one-dimensional cohomology of th e Cayley complex of
25the groupoid (see Corollary 1). In [ 9, Section 5] and [ 41, Section 5], the author described the
space of ordinary derivations of a complex group algebra of the add itive group Z, a ﬁnitely
generated free abelian group and a ﬁnitely generated free group.
4 Inner (σ,τ)-Derivations of Group Rings
LetGbe a group and Rbe a commutative unital ring. Unless stated otherwise, in this
section, we always assume that σandτare any two unital R-algebra endomorphisms of the
group algebra RG, which are R-linear extensions of the group endomorphisms of G. This
section classiﬁes all inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of RGby giving the rank and a basis of the
R-module of all inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of RG. Also, we prove that every ( σ,τ)-derivation
ofRGis an inner ( σ,τ)-derivation if the order of Gis invertible in R, where in this result,
σandτare any two unital R-algebra endomorphisms of RGand need not necessarily be
group endomorphisms of G. Consequently, we explicitly classify all ( σ,τ)-derivations of RG
whenGis a ﬁnite group whose order is invertible in R. To prove our results, we need the
concept of doubly-twisted conjugacy classes introduced in Subse ction4.1.
4.1 Doubly-Twisted Conjugacy Classes
Deﬁnition 4.1. Forx,y∈G,xis said to be (σ,τ)-conjugate to yinGif
y=σ(g)x(τ(g))−1
for some g∈G. The set of all (σ,τ)-conjugates to xis denoted by
xG
(σ,τ)={σ(g)x(τ(g))−1|g∈G}
and is called the (σ,τ)-conjugacy class of xinG.
In particular, if τ=σ, then we simply refer the term ( σ,τ)-conjugation as σ-conjugation.
Note that ( σ,τ)-conjugacy is an equivalence relation. Below, we state some result s that are
analogous to those in classic group theory.
Lemma 4.2. Any two (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gare either equal or disjoint, that is, if
x,y∈G, then either xG
(σ,τ)=yG
(σ,τ)orxG
(σ,τ)∩yG
(σ,τ)=∅.
Note that if 1 is the identity element in G, then for any x∈G,x=σ(1)x(τ(1))−1so
thatx∈xG
(σ,τ). Therefore, Gis a union of its all ( σ,τ)-conjugacy classes.
Corollary 4.3. Gis union of its all (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes and distinct (σ,τ)-conjugacy
classes are pairwise disjoint.
Deﬁnition 4.4. IfG=/uniontextr
i=1(xi)G
(σ,τ)such that the (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes (xi)G
(σ,τ)’s
(1≤i≤r) are distinct, then x1,...,xrare called representatives of the (σ,τ)-conjugacy
classes(x1)G
(σ,τ), ...,(xr)G
(σ,τ)ofG.
We establish more results on the concept of ( σ,τ)-conjugation.
26Lemma 4.5. Letx,y∈Gbe such that xisσ-conjugate to y. Then for any n∈Z,xnis
σ-conjugate to yn. Also,xandyhave the same order.
Deﬁnition 4.6. Letx∈G, then the (σ,τ)-centraliser of xinGis deﬁned to be the set
C(σ,τ)(x) ={g∈G|xτ(g) =σ(g)x}.
Note that C(σ,τ)(x) is a monoid. In particular, if Gis ﬁnite, then C(σ,τ)(x) is a subgroup
ofG. In general, xneed not be an element of C(σ,τ)(x).
Lemma 4.7. LetGbe a ﬁnite group and x∈G. Then
|xG
(σ,τ)|=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleG
C(σ,τ)(x)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle=|G|
|C(σ,τ)(x)|.
In particular, |xG
(σ,τ)|divides|G|.
Deﬁnition 4.8. The set
Z(σ,τ)(G) ={z∈G|zτ(g) =σ(g)z,∀g∈G}
is called the (σ,τ)-center of G.
Observe that Z(σ,τ)(G) ={z∈G|C(σ,τ)(z) =G}. Ifτ=σ, then we denote the ( σ,τ)-
center of Gsimply by Zσ(G) and it is a monoid. If τ=σ=idG(identity map on G), then
the (σ,τ)-center of Gbecomes the usual center of Gdenoted by Z(G). In particular, if G
is ﬁnite, then Zσ(G) becomes a subgroup of G. By Lemma 4.7,|xG
(σ,τ)|= 1 if and only if
x∈Z(σ,τ)(G). Note that we have established the following theorem.
Theorem 4.9. LetGbe a ﬁnite group and x1,...,xrbe representatives of the (σ,τ)-conjugacy
classes of G. Then
|G|=|Z(σ,τ)(G)|+/summationdisplay
xi/∈Z(σ,τ)(G)|(xi)G
(σ,τ)|,
where|(xi)G
(σ,τ)|=|G|
|C(σ,τ)(xi)|(1≤i≤r).
Note that the concept of ( σ,τ)-conjugation is analogous to the idea of usual conjugation
in classic group theory. More such analogies may be drawn.
4.2 The Main Results
Deﬁnition 4.10. The set
Z(σ,τ)(RG) ={z∈RG|zτ(α) =σ(α)z,∀α∈RG}
is called the (σ,τ)-center of RG.
It can be easily checked that Z(σ,τ)(RG) is anR-submodule of the R-module RG. If
τ=σ, then we denote the ( σ,τ)-center of RGbyZσ(RG) andZσ(RG) is a subalgebra of
RG. Ifτ=σ=idRG(identity map on RG), then the ( σ,τ)-center of RGbecomes the usual
center of RGdenoted by Z(RG). Now, we need to ﬁnd the rank and a basis of the R-module
Z(σ,τ)(RG).
27Deﬁnition 4.11. Let{Ci}i∈Ibe the set of all (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gwhich are of
ﬁnite size. For each index i∈I, deﬁne the sum
ˆCi=/summationdisplay
g∈Cig.
These sums ˆCi’s are elements in RGand are called (σ,τ)-class sums.
Lemma 4.12. Let{Ci}i∈Ibe the set of all (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gwhich are of ﬁnite
size. Then the (σ,τ)-class sums {ˆCi}i∈Iform anR-basis of Z(σ,τ)(RG). In particular, if the
groupGis ﬁnite having exactly rdistinct(σ,τ)-conjugacy classes, then the rank of Z(σ,τ)(RG)
isr.
Proof.The proof follows on similar lines as that of Proposition 12 .22 in [24] or that of
Theorem 3 .6.2 in [40].
Theorem 4.13. LetRbe a commutative ring with unity, Gbe a group and {Ci}i∈I(Isome
indexing set) be the collection of all (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gwhich are of ﬁnite size with
respective representatives collection {xi}i∈I. LetJ⊆Isuch that |Cj|= 1for allj∈Jand
|Ci| ≥2for alli∈I\J. Further, let {Ci′}i′∈I′be the collection of all those (σ,τ)-conjugacy
classes of Gwhich are of inﬁnite size. Then the set

forms an R-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(RG).
Proof.By Lemma 4.12, the set B1={ˆCi|i∈I}is anR-basis of Z(σ,τ)(RG). We divide the
proof of this theorem into two steps.
STEP 1: Constructing an R-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(RG).
Assume that the basis B1can be extended to an R-basis, say,
B2={ˆCi}i∈I∪{γi′′}i′′∈I′′
ofRGfor some indexing set I′′. (Note that we have to make this assumption to proceed
because this is not true in general that a basis of an R-submodule Nof anR-module Mcan
be extended to a basis of M, in case of an arbitrary commutative unital ring R. However, if
Ris a ﬁeld, then a basis of Ncan always be extended to a basis of M.)
PutB={Dγi′′|i′′∈I′′}. We show that Bis anR-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(RG).
Letλ∈Randδ,δ1,δ2∈RG. Then for all α∈RG,
Dλδ(α) = (λδ)τ(α)−σ(α)(λδ) =λ(δτ(α)−σ(α)δ) =λDδ(α) = (λDδ)(α)
and
(Dδ1+Dδ2)(α) =Dδ1(α)+Dδ2(α)
= (δ1τ(α)−σ(α)δ1)+(δ2τ(α)−σ(α)δ2)
28= (δ1+δ2)τ(α)−σ(α)(δ1+δ2)
=Dδ1+δ2(α)
Therefore, Dλδ=λDδandDδ1+δ2=Dδ1+Dδ2.
Now, let D∈Inn(σ,τ)(RG). ThenD=Dδfor some

Note that DˆCik= 0 for all k∈ {1,...,s}. SoDδ=/summationtextt
l=1µi′′

l. Therefore, Bspans
Inn(σ,τ)(RG) overR.
Now, let λi′′

l=1⊆I′′(for some t∈N) such that/summationtextt
l=1λi′′
lDγi′′
l= 0.

k=1⊆I(for some s∈N).
⇒µik= 0,∀k∈ {1,...,s}andλi′′
l= 0,∀l∈ {1,...,t}.
Therefore, every ﬁnite subset of Bis linearly independent over R. Therefore, the set B
isR-linearly independent. Hence, Bforms an R-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(RG).
STEP 2: Constructing {γi′′}i′′∈I′′.
Put
B3=

g/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg∈/uniondisplay

i′∈I′Ci′/bracerightigg
.
SinceGis anR-linearly independent subset of RGandB3is a subset of G, therefore, B3
is also an R-linearly independent subset of RG.
Since the R-spans of B1andB3intersect trivially, and the sets B1,B3are both R-linearly
independent, therefore, the set B′
2=B1∪B3is anR-linearly independent subset of RG.
Now, we show that B′
2spansRGoverR.
Letg∈Gbe arbitrary but ﬁxed. Then, we have the following possible cases.
Case 1: g∈Z(σ,τ)(G).
Then by the observation just after Deﬁnition 4.8,|gG
(σ,τ)|= 1. Thus, gG
(σ,τ)=Cj0, that is,
Cj0={g}for some j0∈J. SoˆCj0=g. Therefore, g∈ B1⊆ B′
2. Hence, gbelongs to the
R-span ofB′
2.
Case 2: g∈G\Z(σ,τ)(G).
29Then by the observation following Deﬁnition 4.8,|gG
(σ,τ)| ≥2. Therefore,
g∈
/uniondisplay
i∈I\JCi
/uniondisplay/parenleftigg/uniondisplay
i′∈I′Ci′/parenrightigg
.
Then we have the following subcases.
Subcase 2.1: g∈/uniontext
i′∈I′Ci′.
Theng∈ B3⊆ B′
2. Hence, gbelongs to the R-span ofB′
2.
Subcase 2.2: g∈/uniontext
i∈I\JCi.
Theng∈Cifor some i∈I\J.
Now, since Ci= (xi)G
(σ,τ), soCi= (Ci\ {xi})∪ {xi}. Therefore, g∈Ciimplies that
g∈Ci\{xi}org∈ {xi}.
Ifg∈Ci\{xi}, theng∈ B3⊆ B′
2. Hence, gbelongs to the R-span ofB′
2.
Ifg=xi, then observe that g=ˆCi−(/summationtext
h∈Ci\{xi}h) so that gbelongs to the R-span of
B′
2.
So, we have ﬁnally exhausted all the cases. In all possible cases, we have proved that g
belongs to the R-span ofB′
2.
Sinceg∈Gis arbitrary, therefore, every element in Glies in the R-span ofB′
2. That is,
Gis contained in the R-span ofB′
2. Thus, the R-span ofGis contained in the R-span ofB′
2.
SinceGis anR-basis of RG, so itsR-span equals the whole of RG. So, we have proved
thatRGis contained in the R-span ofB′
2.
SinceB′
2is a subset of RG, therefore, its R-span is automatically contained in RG.
Therefore, the R-span ofB′
2is equal to RG, that is, B′
2spansRGoverR.
Therefore, B′
2becomes an R-linearly independent subset of RGwhich spans RGoverR.
Therefore, B′
2is anR-basis of RG.
Therefore, B′
2=B1∪B3is anR-basis of RGwhich extends the R-basisB1ofZ(σ,τ)(RG).
So we can take our set {γi′′}i′′∈I′′(as in STEP 1) to be B3(that is, I′′= (I\J)∪I′).
Therefore, by STEP 1, the set B0={Dg|g∈ B3}is anR-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(FG). Note
thatB0is the same set as given in the statement of the theorem.
Hence proved.
Recall the deﬁnition of a ( σ,τ)-FC group from [ 1] (see Section 6). If Gis a group and σ,τ
are its group endomorphisms, then Gis said to be a ( σ,τ)-FC group if every ( σ,τ)-conjugacy
class ofGis of ﬁnite size.
The corollary given below is the immediate consequence of Theorem 4.13.
Corollary 4.14. LetRbe a commutative ring with unity, Gbe a(σ,τ)-FC group and {Ci}i∈I
(Isome indexing set) be the collection of all (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gwith respective
representatives collection {xi}i∈I. LetJ⊆Isuch that |Cj|= 1for allj∈Jand|Ci| ≥2
for alli∈I\J. Then the set
B0=

forms an R-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(RG).
30Below, we have another corollary for a ﬁnite group, which is a special case of a ( σ,τ)-FC
group.
Corollary 4.15. LetRbe a commutative ring with unity, Gbe a ﬁnite group of order n
andC1,...,Crbe the all possible distinct (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gwith representatives
x1,...,xr, respectively. Then the rank of the R-module Inn (σ,τ)(RG)isn−r. Furthermore, if s
is a positive integer such that |Ci|= 1for alli∈ {1,...,s}and|Ci| ≥2for alli∈ {s+1,...,r},
then the set

Dg/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingleg∈r/uniondisplay
i=s+1(Ci\{xi})/bracerightigg

The following corollary is stated in particular, when R=Fis a ﬁeld.
Corollary 4.16. LetFbe a ﬁeld, Gbe a ﬁnite group of order nandC1,...,Crbe the
all possible distinct (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of Gwith representatives x1,...,xr, respectively.
Then the dimension of Inn (σ,τ)(FG)overFisn−r. Ifsis a positive integer such that
|Ci|= 1for alli∈ {1,...,s}and|Ci| ≥2for alli∈ {s+1,...,r}, then the set
B0=/braceleftigg
Dg|g∈r/uniondisplay
i=s+1(Ci\{xi})/bracerightigg
is anF-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(FG).
Proof.The proof follows directly fromTheorem 4.13or Corollary 4.15, but we can also prove
it by following a slightly diﬀerent approach in the end.
By Lemma 4.12, dim(Z(σ,τ)(FG)) =randB1={ˆCi|1≤i≤r}is anF-basis of
Z(σ,τ)(FG). The basis B1can be extended to an F-basis, say, B2={ˆC1,...,ˆCr,γr+1,...,γn}of
FG.
PutB={Dγi|r+1≤i≤n}. Then as shown in the proof of Theorem 4.13, it can be
shown that Bis a basis of Inn (σ,τ)(FG) overF.
As|B|=n−r, therefore, dim(Inn (σ,τ)(FG)) =n−r. Note that this fact also follows
from the fact that the map θ:FG→Inn(σ,τ)(FG) (α/ma√sto→Dα) is anF-linear map with null
spaceZ(σ,τ)(FG).
Now, we show that B0is anF-basis of Inn (σ,τ)(FG).
Let|Ci|=ni,∀i∈ {s+ 1,...,r}. AsG=/uniontextr

SinceGis anF-linearly independent subset of FGand the ( σ,τ)-conjugacy classes Ci’s
(1≤i≤r) are pairwise disjoint, so we get that
λg= 0,∀g∈r/uniondisplay
i=s+1(Ci\{xi}).
Therefore, the set B0isF-linearly independent.
Further, since the sets Cs+1\{xs+1},...,Cr\{xr}are pairwise disjoint, therefore,

So|B0|= dim(Inn (σ,τ)(FG)). Therefore, B0is a basis of Inn (σ,τ)(FG).
Hence proved.
Note that the set
{Dγ|γ∈ {g−xi|g∈ ∪r
i=s+1(Ci\{xi})}}
is another basis of Inn (σ,τ)(FG) overF.
Below, we prove a signiﬁcant result.
Theorem 4.17. LetRbe a ring with unity and Gbe a ﬁnite group of order n, which is
invertible in R. Letσ,τbe arbitrary unital R-algebra endomorphisms of RG. Then every
(σ,τ)-derivation of RGis inner.
Proof.LetD∈ D(σ,τ)(RG). Put

D(αβ) =D(α)τ(β)+σ(α)D(β)
so that
σ(α)D(β) =D(αβ)−D(α)τ(β).

Corollary 4.18. LetRbe a commutative ring with unity and Gbe a ﬁnite group whose
order is invertible in R. LetC1,...,Crbe the all possible distinct (σ,τ)-conjugacy classes of
Gwith representatives x1,...,xr, respectively. Then every (σ,τ)-derivation of RGis inner,
that is,D(σ,τ)(RG) =Inn(σ,τ)(RG). Furthermore, if sis a positive integer such that |Ci|= 1
for alli∈ {1,...,s}and|Ci| ≥2for alli∈ {s+1,...,r}, then the set
B0=/braceleftigg
Dg|g∈r/uniondisplay
i=s+1(Ci\{xi})/bracerightigg
is anR-basis of D(σ,τ)(RG).
Proof.Follows from Corollary 4.15and Theorem 4.17.
Finally, we compare this section’s results with those already known in t he literature.
Theorem 4.13is a much broader result that classiﬁes all the inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of a
group algebra RGof an arbitrary group Gover an arbitrary commutative unital ring R,
whereσ,τareR-algebra endomorphisms of RGwhich are R-linear extensions of the group
endomorphismsof G. Also, Corollary 4.16generalizesTheorem2.17of[ 38],whichwasproved
forordinaryderivations. In[ 1], theauthorsconsideredthe( σ,τ) and(σ,id)-derivationsofthe
group algebra CGof a discrete countable group G, whereσ,τareC-algebra endomorphisms
ofCGwhich are C-linear extensions of the group endomorphisms of G. Theorem 4.17
generalizes [ 1, Corollary 5] in which the authors proved that every ( σ,τ)-derivation of the
group algebra CGof a ﬁnite group Gis inner. In [ 1, Corollary 7], the authors gave a criterion
for a (σ,τ)-derivation of the group algebra CGof a ﬁnitely generated ( σ,τ)-FC group Gto
be inner. In [ 1, Section 4], the authors studied quasi-inner ( σ,τ)-derivations of CGdeﬁned
by the authors in [ 1, Deﬁnition 6] using characters. In [ 1, Proposition 2] and [ 1, Deﬁnition
8], the authors deﬁned a ( σ,τ)-central ( σ,τ)-derivation. In [ 1, Proposition 3], the authors
proved that a non-zero ( σ,τ)-central ( σ,τ)-derivation is not quasi-inner. In [ 1, Theorem 2],
the authors gave a way to calculate quasi-inner ( σ,τ)-derivations. In [ 3] also, the authors
studiedtheordinaryinner derivationsofﬁniteandFCgroupsusing t opologicalandcharacter
techniques. In [ 3, Theorem 4.3], the authors gave a characterization under which all ordinary
derivations of AGare inner for a ﬁnite group Gand a ﬁnite commutative unital ring A. In
[3, Corollary 4.2.4], the authors proved that for a torsion-free comm utative unital ring A
and a ﬁnite group G, all derivations of AGare inner. In [ 6], the authors described the
space of all inner and outer derivations of a group algebra of a ﬁnite ly presented discrete
group in terms of the character spaces of the 2-groupoid of the a djoint action of the group.
Theorem 4.17also generalizes [ 15, Theorem 1.1]. Also, note that a result similar to Theorem
4.17was obtained for ordinary derivations to be locally inner in [ 2, Lemma 3] and earlier
in [29, Theorem 2.1]. For more details, we refer the reader to the third pa ragraph of the
introduction section (Section 1), where we have mentioned the work done in literature on the
33problem of determining the conditions under which a derivation or a tw isted derivation of a
group algebra is inner thus illustrating the fact that this problem has always been of interest
to researchers. We also refer the reader to the end of Subsectio n3.4for more insights.
5 Application: σ-Derivations of Dihedral Group
Algebras
In this section, we apply the results obtained in Sections 3and4to explicitly classify all
inner and outer σ-derivations of the dihedral group algebra FD2n, whereFis an arbitrary
ﬁeld and
D2n=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta,b|an= 1 =b2,(ab)2= 1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht
(n≥3). In [32], the author has given all group homomorphisms from D2mtoD2nfor
arbitrary positive integers mandn. Whennis odd,D2nhas precisely n2+1 group endo-
morphisms which are of the following two forms:
•σ−1(a) = 1 and σ−1(b) = 1.
•σ0(a) =as(1≤s≤n−1) andσ0(b) =atb(0≤t≤n−1).
Whennis even,D2nhas precisely ( n+2)2group endomorphisms which are of the following
forms:
•σ1(a) =as(0≤s≤n−1,s/\e}atio\slash= 0,n
2) andσ1(b) =atb(0≤t≤n−1).
•σ2(a) =as(s= 0,n
2) andσ2(b) =at(t= 0,n
2).
•σ3(a) =as(s= 0,n
2) andσ3(b) =atb(0≤t≤n−1).
•σ4(a) =asb(0≤s≤n−1),σ4(b) =atb(t=s,s+n
2).
•σ5(a) =asb(0≤s≤n−1),σ5(b) =at(t= 0,n
2).
We will obtain the results for just σ0whennis odd and σ1whennis even because results
for the remaining ones become exercises.
5.1σ-Derivations of FD2nwhen char (F) = 0or an odd prime p
Deﬁnition 5.1. LetRbe a ring with unity and Gbe a group. Let β∈RG. Then the set
¯C(β) ={α∈RG|αβ=−βα}
is called the anti-centralizer of βinRG.
¯C(β) is a submodule of the R-module RG. IfR=Fis a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 or an
odd rational prime pandg∈G∩Z(FG), then¯C(g) ={0}. This is so because if α∈¯C(g),
thenαg=−gαso thatαg=−αg(asgα=αg). This gives 2 αg= 0 so that 2 α= 0. But
since char( F)/\e}atio\slash= 2, therefore, α= 0. Therefore, ¯C(g) ={0}.
34Lemma 5.2. LetFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 0or an odd rational prime pandσ=σ0or
σ1.
(i) The set
¯B(σ(b)) ={(ai−a−i), at(ai−a−i)b|1≤i≤ ⌊n−1

is a basis of ¯C(σ(b))overF.
(ii) The set
¯B(σ(ab)) ={(ai−a−i), as+t(ai−a−i)b|1≤i≤ ⌊n−1

is a basis of ¯C(σ(ab))overF.
Proof.First, let nbe odd.
(i)It can be easily veriﬁed that ¯B(σ0(b)) is anF-linearly independent subset of ¯C(σ0(b)).
Now, let α∈¯C(σ0(b)) and
α=/summationdisplay

We make the following assumption (A*), which will be used to simplify the calculations:
(A*): For each j∈ {0,1},λi,j=λi′,jwhenever i≡i′(modn).
Now,
ασ0(b) =/summationdisplay

and
σ0(b)α=/summationdisplay

Therefore, from ασ0(b) =−σ0(b)α, we get that

Therefore, λi,0=−λ(n−i),0for alli∈ {0,1,...,n−1}. In particular, λ0,0= 0. Therefore,

Therefore, the set ¯B(σ0(b)) spans ¯C(σ0(b)) overF. Hence, ¯B(σ0(b)) is anF-basis of ¯C(σ0(b)).
(ii)The map θ:D2n→D2ndeﬁned by
θ(aibj) =ai(asb)j(0≤i≤n−1,0≤j≤1),
36is an automorphism of D2n. Extending θF-linearly to the whole of FD2nmakesθan
automorphism of the group algebra FD2n. Note that θ(a) =aandθ(b) =asb.
We show that α∈¯C(σ0(b)) if and only if θ(α)∈¯C(σ0(ab)).
First, let α∈¯C(σ0(b)). Then α∈FD2nsuch that
ασ0(b) =−σ0(b)α,that is, α(atb) =−(atb)α.
Note that αcan be written as α=c0+c1bfor some c0,c1∈F/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht. Thenθ(α) =c0+c1asb.
Asα(atb) =−(atb)α, soc0atb+c1batb=−atbc0−atbc1bso that
c0atb=−atbc0andc1bat=−atbc1.
Therefore,
θ(α)σ0(ab) = (c0+c1asb)(as+tb)
=asc0atb+c1batb
=−asatbc0−atbc1b
=−as+tb(c0+c1asb)
=−σ0(ab)θ(α).
Therefore, θ(α)∈¯C(σ0(ab)).
Conversely, let θ(α)∈¯C(σ0(ab)). Then θ(α)σ0(ab) =−σ0(ab)θ(α). This gives
as+tc0b+c1batb=−as+tbc0−atbc1b
so that
c0b=−bc0andc1bat=−atbc1.
Therefore,
ασ0(b) = (c0+c1b)atb
=atc0b+c1batb
=−atbc0−atbc1b
=−σ0(b)(c0+c1b)
=−σ0(b)α.
Therefore, α∈¯C(σ0(b)).
Therefore, the set θ(¯B(σ0(b))) =¯B(σ0(ab)) is anF-basis of ¯C(σ0(ab)).
The proof for neven is similar to that for nodd.
LetFbe a ﬁeld and σbe anF-algebra endomorphism of FD2nwhich is an F-linear
extension of a group endomorphism of D2n. The set X={a,b}is the generating set of D2n
andan,b2,(ab)2are its relators. Let f:X→FD2nbe a map that can be extended to a
σ-derivation of FD2n. By Theorem 3.4, this happens if and only if
˜f(an) = 0,˜f(b2) = 0 and ˜f((ab)2) = 0,
37where˜f:F(X)→FD2nis the unique extension of fdeﬁned in ( 3.2) and (3.3) and satisfying
(3.1), andF(X) is the free group on X.
Now, in view of Lemma 3.3and (3.1),
˜f(b2) =˜f(b)˜σ(b)+ ˜σ(b)˜f(b) =f(b)σ(b)+σ(b)f(b)
as ˜σ=σonG. So˜f(b2) = 0 if and only if f(b)σ(b) =−σ(b)f(b), that is, f(b)∈¯C(σ(b)).
Similarly, ˜f((ab)2) = 0 if and only if ˜f(ab)∈¯C(σ(ab)). Since f(a)∈FD2n, sof(a) can be
written as f(a) =c0+c1bfor some c0,c1∈F/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht. Now, using ( 3.3),
˜f(an) =n/summationdisplay
i=1(i−1/productdisplay
j=1σ(a))˜f(a)(n/productdisplay
j=i+1σ(a))

j=0(σ(a))jc0(σ(a))n−(j+1)+n−1/summationdisplay
j=0(σ(a))jc1b(σ(a))n−(j+1).(5.1)
Further, since ˜f(ab) =˜f(a)˜σ(b)+ ˜σ(a)˜f(b) =f(a)σ(b)+σ(a)f(b), so
f(a) =˜f(ab)σ(b)−σ(a)f(b)σ(b) (5.2)
We note that any σ-derivation Dof the group algebra FD2nis uniquely determined by
its images D(a) andD(b) on the generators aandbofD2n. We denote such a derivation by
D(σ;¯a,¯b),
where ¯a=D(a) and¯b=D(b). Also, we know that Dσ(FD2n) forms a vector space over F.
We determine this vector space’s dimension and basis in the following th eorems.
Consider σ=σ0orσ1. Sincef(b)∈¯C(σ(b)) and by Lemma 5.2,¯B(σ(b)) is a basis of
¯C(σ(b)) overF, therefore,
f(b) =⌊n−1

i=1νiat(ai−a−i)b (5.3)

Further, since ˜f(ab)∈¯C(σ(ab)) and by Lemma 5.2,¯B(σ(ab)) is a basis of ¯C(σ(ab)) over
F, therefore,
˜f(ab) =⌊n−1

(b) If gcd (d,p)/\e}atio\slash= 1, then the dimension of Dσ0(FD2n)overFis4(n−1

Proof.By (5.1),
˜f(an) =nc0as(n−1)+n−1/summationdisplay

Therefore, ˜f(an) = 0 if and only if

Claim:For each j∈ {1,2,...,d}, the equations

are redundant.
Proof of the Claim: First, make the following observations:
•For each j∈ {1,2,...,d},
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j
is the sum of coeﬃcients λj,λd+j,...,λ(m−1)d+jcorresponding to aj,ad+j,...,a(m−1)d+j
respectively.
•/summationtextm−1
i=0λn−(di+j)is the sum of coeﬃcients λn−j,λn−(d+j),...,λn−((m−1)d+j)corresponding
to
an−j=a−j, an−(d+j)=a−(d+j), ..., an−((m−1)d+j)=a−((m−1)d+j)
respectively.
•Sincen−(di+j) = (m−1−i)d+(d−j), therefore,
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λn−(di+j)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j).
41•From the expression
c′
1=n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai−a−i)−n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i−as−i),
it is very clear that if δi(1≤i≤n−1
2) is the coeﬃcient of adi0+j(for some i0∈
{0,1,...,m−1},j∈ {1,...,d}), then−δiis the coeﬃcient of an−(di0+j)=a−(di0+j).
•The scalar −µi(1≤i≤n−1
2) is the coeﬃcient of as+i. Suppose
s+i≡i1(modn),
wherei1∈ {0,1,...,n−1}. Thens+i=i1+nkfor some non-negative integer k. Let
i1=di0+jfor some i0∈ {0,1,...,m−1},j∈ {1,...,d}. So−µiis the coeﬃcient of
as+i=ai1=adi0+j.
Also,µiis the coeﬃcient of
as−i=as+(n−i)
and
s+(n−i) =n−(di′
0+j),
wherei′
0=mk+i0−2l. Now, since mis a positive integer, so by division algorithm,
there exists some i′′
0∈ {0,1,...,m−1}such that i′
0=mq+i′′
0. Then
as−i=as+(n−i)=an−(di′
0+j)=an−(d(mq+i′′
0)+j)=an−(di′′
0+j).
From the above observations, we can conclude that if a scalar (out ofδi,−δi,µi,−µifor
1≤i≤n−1
2) appears in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j,
then the negative of this scalar will appear in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λn−(di+j)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)
and vice versa. Therefore, the equations
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j= 0 andm−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)= 0
are redundant. Hence, the claim is proved.

j/\e}atio\slash=d−j, the sums

i=0λdi+(d−j)
42are diﬀerent and satisfy
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)=−m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j
so that the equations
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j= 0 andm−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)= 0
are redundant. But for j=d, the sums
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+jandm−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)
are same because
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j=m/summationdisplay
i=1λdi,m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdiandm/summationdisplay
i=1λdi=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi
(asλ0=λn). Therefore, for j=d, there is only one equation which always holds because
for each coeﬃcient λdj(corresponding to adj) appearing in the sum/summationtextm−1
i=0λdi, the negative
of this coeﬃcient, namely, −λdj(corresponding to a−dj) also appears in the sum/summationtextm−1
i=0λdi.
So overall, we have r0=d−1
2number of distinct equations each containing mnumber
of distinct coeﬃcients (out of δi,−δi,µi,−µifor 1≤i≤n−1
2). So from each of these r0
distinct equations, one coeﬃcient can be expressed linearly in terms of otherm−1 distinct
coeﬃcients present in the equation. Also, no two equations out of t heser0distinct equations
have any coeﬃcient in common.
Finally,f(a) =c1b(asc0= 0), where we have obtained above the conditions on the
coeﬃcients appearing in the expression for c1in the form of r0distinct equations. This and
the expression for f(b) in (5.3) together give the following set.
S0={D(σ0;¯a,¯b)|(¯a,¯b)∈ {(at(ai−a−i)b,0),(as+t(ai−a−i)b,(ai−a−i)),(0,at(ai−a−i)b)
|1≤i≤n−1
2}},
where ¯a=D(a) =f(a) =c1band¯b=D(b) =f(b).
Ifc1,c2∈Fandα1,α2,β1,β2∈FD2n, then
/parenleftbig
c1D(σ0;α1,β1)+c2D(σ0;α2,β2)/parenrightbig
(a) =c1D(σ0;α1,β1)(a)+c2D(σ0;α2,β2)(a)
=c1α1+c2α2
=D(σ0;c1α1+c2α2,c1β1+c2β2)(a).
Similarly,
D(σ0;c1α1+c2α2,c1β1+c2β2)(b) =/parenleftbig
c1D(σ0;α1,β1)+c2D(σ0;α2,β2)/parenrightbig
(b).
Since any σ0-derivation of FD2nis completely determined by its image values D(a) andD(b),
therefore, from above, we get that
c1D(σ0;α1,β1)+c2D(σ0;α2,β2)=D(σ0;c1α1+c2α2,c1β1+c2β2).
43Therefore, S0spansDσ0(FD2n) overF. Furthermore, in view of the above observations, we
have that the dimension of Dσ0(FD2n) overFis
|S0|−r0= 3(n−1
2)−(d−1
2) =1
2(3n−d)−1.
(ii)char(F) =pwith gcd( n,p) =p.
Then the equation nc0= 0 holds. As computed in part (i), f(a) =c0+c1b, where
c0=n−1

i=1(γi−νi)as(ai−a−i) and c1=at(n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai−a−i)−n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i−as−i)).
In this case, we again have two subcases.
(a)gcd(d,p) = 1.
The proof for this subcase is on the same lines as that of part (i). Pu t
S′
0={D(σ0;¯a,¯b)|(¯a,¯b)∈ {(as(ai−a−i),0),(as(ai−a−i),at(ai−a−i)b),(at(ai−a−i)b,0),
(as+t(ai−a−i)b,(ai−a−i))|1≤i≤n−1
2}}.
Then, as shown in part (i), it can be shown that S′
0is a spanning set for Dσ0(FD2n) overF
so that the dimension of Dσ0(FD2n) overFis
|S′
0|−r0= 4(n−1
2)−(d−1
2) = 2n−1
2(d+3).
(b)gcd(d,p) =p.
Since
n−1/summationdisplay
j=0asjc1=d(m/summationdisplay
j=1asj)c1,
char(F) =pandpdividesd, therefore, in this subcase, the equation
n−1/summationdisplay
j=0asjc1= 0
holds. Therefore, the set S′
0becomes a basis of Dσ0(FD2n) overF. Hence, the dimension of
Dσ0(FD2n) overFis|S′
0|= 4(n−1
2).
Takingσ0to be the identity endomorphism in Theorem 5.3gives that the dimension
of theF-vector space D(FD2n) of ordinary derivations of FD2nwhennis odd is 3(n−1
2) if
char(F) = 0 orpwith gcd( n,p) = 1 and 2( n−1) if char( F) =pwith gcd( n,p)/\e}atio\slash= 1. Further,
we also get an F-basis for D(FD2n).

Proceed as in the proof of Theorem 5.3. Sincedis even, so d= 2+...+2/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
r0-times= 2r0for some
positive integer r0. Using the proof of Theorem 5.3, we have the following observations here:
•Ifj∈ {1,...,d−1}\{d
2}, thend−j∈ {1,...,d−1},d−j/\e}atio\slash=d
2andj/\e}atio\slash=d−j. For such
j, we will have two redundant equations
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j= 0
45(that corresponds to j) and
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)= 0
(that corresponds to d−j).
•Forj=d
2,
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+d
2.
Therefore, for j=d
2, there is only one equation, namely,
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+d
2= 0.
This equation always holds because if a scalar (out of δi,−δi,µi,−µifor 1≤i≤n
2−1)
appears in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+d
2,
then the negative of this scalar will appear in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λn−(di+d
2)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−d
2)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+d
2
so that this sum is always equal to 0.
•Also, as seen in the proof of Theorem 5.3, there is only one equation corresponding to
j=dand this too always holds.
Therefore, out of dequations, two equations corresponding to j=d
2andj=dalways
hold. Amongst the remaining d−2 values of j(j∈ {1,...,d−1}\{d
2}), there are exactly
d−2
2number of distinct equations because the equations correspondin g tojandd−jare
redundant. So overall, we haved−2
2=d
2−1 =r0−1 number of distinct equations each
containing mnumber of distinct coeﬃcients (out of δi,−δi,µi,−µifor 1≤i≤n
2−1) so that
one coeﬃcient can be expressed linearly in terms of the remaining m−1 distinct coeﬃcients
present in the equation. Also, no two equations out of these r0−1 distinct equations have
any coeﬃcient in common. Therefore, the set S1(given in the theorem’s statement) becomes
a spanning set for Dσ1(FD2n) overF. Also, in view of the above observations, the dimension
ofDσ1(FD2n) overFis
|S1|−(r0−1) = 3(n
2−1)−(d
2−1) =1
2(3n−d)−2.
(b)char(F) =pwith gcd( n,p) =p.
46Then the equation nc0= 0 holds. So f(a) =c0+c1b, where
c0=n
2−1/summationdisplay
i=1(γi−νi)as(ai−a−i) and c1=at(n
2−1/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai−a−i)−n
2−1/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i−as−i)).
Again, we have two subcases.
(b1)gcd(d,p) = 1.
The proof for this subcase is on the same lines as part (i) (a). Clearly , the set S′
1(given
in the theorem’s statement) is a spanning set for Dσ1(FD2n) overFand the dimension of
Dσ1(FD2n) overFis
|S′
1|−(r0−1) = 4(n
2−1)−(d
2−1) = 2n−d
2−3.
(b2)gcd(d,p) =p.
As seen in the proof of Theorem 5.3(ii) (b), in this subcase, the equation
n−1/summationdisplay
j=0asjc1= 0
holds. Then the set S′
1becomes a basis of Dσ1(FD2n) overFso that the dimension of
Dσ1(FD2n) overFis|S′
1|= 2(n−2).
(ii)We skip the proof of this part as the proof is similar to that of part (i) . All steps are
analogous. One observation is that the roles of s,d,landmget replaced by that of 2 s, 2d,
l
2andm
2respectively.
If we take σ1to be the identity endomorphism, then from Theorem 5.4(ii), we get that
the dimension of the F-vector space D(FD2n) of ordinary derivations of FD2nwhennis even
is 3(n
2−1) if char( F) =pwith gcd( n,p) = 1 and 2( n−2) if char( F) =pwith gcd( n,p) =p.
In addition, we also obtain a basis for D(FD2n) overF.
5.2σ-Derivations of FD2nwhen char (F) = 2
In this subsection, we classify all σ-derivations (for σ=σ0whennis odd and σ=σ1when
nis even) of FD2nover a ﬁeld Fof characteristic 2.
First, let us recall the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 5.5. LetGbe a group and Rbe a commutative ring with unity. Let β∈RG.
Then the set
C(β) ={α∈RG|αβ=βα}
is called the centralizer of βinRG.
Note that C(β) is a subalgebra of RGand ifβ∈Z(RG), thenC(β) =RG.
47Lemma 5.6. LetFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 2.
(i) Letnbe odd.
(a) The set
B(σ0(b)) ={1, atb}∪{(ai+a−i), at(ai+a−i)b|1≤i≤n−1
2}
is a basis of C(σ0(b))overF.
(b) The set
B(σ0(ab)) ={1, as+tb}∪{(ai+a−i), as+t(ai+a−i)b|1≤i≤n−1
2}
is a basis of C(σ0(ab))overF.
(ii) Letnbe even.
(a) The set
B(σ1(b)) ={1, an
2, atb, at+n
2b}∪{(ai+a−i), at(ai+a−i)b|1≤i≤n
2−1}
is a basis of C(σ1(b))overF.
(b) The set
B(σ1(ab)) ={1, an
2, as+tb,as+t+n
2b}∪{(ai+a−i), as+t(ai+a−i)b|1≤i≤n
2−1}
is a basis of C(σ1(ab))overF.
Proof.Similar to the proof of Lemma 5.2.
Recall the discussion just before Theorem 5.3. Here since char( F) = 2, so
˜f(b2) =f(b)σ(b)+σ(b)f(b) = 0
if and only if
f(b)σ(b) =σ(b)f(b),that is, f(b)∈C(σ(b)).
Similarly, ˜f((ab)2) = 0 if and only if ˜f(ab)∈C(σ(ab)). Also, ( 5.2) becomes
f(a) =˜f(ab)σ(b)+σ(a)f(b)σ(b). (5.5)
Theorem 5.7. Letnbe odd and Fbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 2. Denote |σ0(a)|=m,d=n
m
andt≡j0(mods) for some j0∈ {0,1,...,s−1}. Then the dimension of Dσ0(FD2n)overF
is1
2(3n−d)+1and the set
S0={D(σ0;¯a,¯b)|(¯a,¯b)∈ {(at(1+as)b,1),(0,atb)} ∪ {(at(ai+a−i)b,0),
(as+t(ai+a−i)b,(ai−a−i)),(0,at(ai+a−i)b)|1≤i≤n−1
2}}
is a spanning set.
48Proof.Sincef(b)∈C(σ0(b)) and by Lemma 5.6(i) (a),B(σ0(b)) is anF-basis of C(σ0(b)),
therefore,
f(b) =µ0+ν0atb+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(ai+a−i)+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1νiat(ai+a−i)b
for some µi,νi∈F(1≤i≤n−1
2).
Further, since ˜f(ab)∈C(σ0(ab)) and by Lemma 5.6(i) (b),B(σ0(ab)) is anF-basis of
C(σ(ab)), therefore,
˜f(ab) =δ0+γ0as+tb+n−1

i=1δi(ai+a−i)+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1γias+t(ai+a−i)b
for some δi,γi∈F(1≤i≤n−1
2).
As seen in the proof of Theorem 5.3,˜f(an) = 0 if and only if
nc0= 0 andn−1/summationdisplay
j=0asjc′
1= 0,
wherec′
1=a−tc1.
Further, if
c′
1=n/summationdisplay
i=1λiai
for some λi∈F(1≤i≤n) (λ0=λn), then
n−1/summationdisplay
j=0asjc′
1= 0
if and only if
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j= 0 for all 1 ≤j≤d.
By (5.5),
c0+c1b=f(a) =˜f(ab)atb+asf(b)atb.
Therefore,
c0= (γ0+ν0)as+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1(γi+νi)as(ai+a−i)
and
c1=at(δ0+µ0as+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai+a−i)+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i+as−i)).
49But since c0= 0, so we must have that γi=νifor all 0≤i≤n−1
2. Also,
c′
1=a−tc1=δ0+µ0as+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai+a−i)+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i+as−i).
Now, proceeding exactly as in the proof of Theorem 5.3(Case (i): char( F) = 0 orpwith
gcd(n,p) = 1) and using the fact that char( F) = 2, we get that if a scalar (out of δi,µifor
0≤i≤n−1
2) appears in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j,
then that scalar also appears in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λn−(di+j)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)
and vice versa. Therefore,
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)
so that the equations
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+j= 0
(corresponding to j) and
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−j)= 0
(corresponding to d−j) are exactly the same. Therefore, there are preciselyd−1
2distinct
equations for j∈ {1,...,d−1}. Further, for j=d, there is only one equation which is given
by
δ0+µ0+/summationdisplay
(coeﬃcients corresponding to adithat appear in the sumsn−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai+a−i) and
n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i+as−i)) = 0.
Note that the sum of coeﬃcients corresponding to the powers adithat appear in the sums
n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai+a−i) andn−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i+as−i)
50is 0 as for each coeﬃcient λdj(corresponding to adj) appearing in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi,
the coeﬃcient λdj(corresponding to a−dj) also appears in the sum
m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λn−(di+d)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi+(d−d)=m−1/summationdisplay
i=0λdi.
Therefore, δ0+µ0= 0 so that δ0=µ0. Therefore, for j=d, we have only one equation,
namely,δ0+µ0= 0.
So overall, we have r0=d−1
2number of distinct equations each containing mnumber
of distinct coeﬃcients (out of δi,µifor 1≤i≤n−1
2) together with the equation δ0=µ0.
Also, no two equations out of these r0distinct equations have any coeﬃcient in common.
Further, from each of these r0distinct equations, one coeﬃcient can be expressed linearly in
terms of other m−1 distinct coeﬃcients present in the equation. Also, since δ0=µ0, so the
expression for c1becomes
c1=at(µ0(1+as)+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1δi(ai+a−i)+n−1
2/summationdisplay
i=1µi(as+i+as−i)).
Therefore, the set S0(given in the theorem’s statement) becomes a spanning set for
Dσ0(FD2n) overF. Further, in view of the above observations, we have that the dime nsion
ofDσ0(FD2n) overFis
|S0|−r0= 3(n−1
2)+2−(d−1
2) =1
2(3n−d)+1.
From Theorem 5.7, we get that when nis odd and char( F) = 2, then the dimension of
theF-vector space D(FD2n) of ordinary derivations of FD2nis3n+1
2by taking σ0to be the
identity endomorphism.
Theorem 5.8. Letnbe even and Fbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 2. Denote |σ1(a)|=m,d=n
m
andt≡j0(mods) for some j0∈ {0,1,...,s−1}. Then the dimension of Dσ1(FD2n)overF
is2(n+2)and a basis is
B1={D(σ1;¯a,¯b)|(¯a,¯b)∈ {(as+tb,1),(as+t+n

(as(ai+a−i),at(ai+a−i)b),(at(ai+a−i)b,0),(as(ai+a−i),0)|1≤i≤n
2−1}}.
Proof.Sincef(b)∈C(σ1(b)) and by Lemma 5.6(ii) (a),B(σ1(b)) is anF-basis of C(σ1(b)),
therefore,
f(b) =µ−1+µ0an

i=1νiat(ai+a−i)b
51for some µi,νi∈F(1≤i≤n
2−1).
Further, since ˜f(ab)∈C(σ1(ab)) and by Lemma 5.6(ii) (b),B(σ1(ab)) is anF-basis of
C(σ1(ab)), therefore,
˜f(ab) =δ−1+δ0an

2−1/summationdisplay
i=1γias+t(ai+a−i)b
for some δi,γi∈F(1≤i≤n

Now, in view of ( 5.1),˜f(an) = 0 if and only if
nc0= 0 andn−1/summationdisplay
j=0a2sjc1= 0.
Sincenis even,nc0= 0 holds and

so that
n−1/summationdisplay
j=0a2sjc1= 0

Therefore, the set B1(given in the theorem’s statement) is a basis of Dσ1(FD2n) overF.
Hence, the dimension of Dσ1(FD2n) overFis|B1|= 2(n+2).
If we take σ1to be the identity endomorphism in Theorem 5.8, then for neven and
char(F) = 2, we get the dimension of the F-vector space of ordinary derivations of FD2nto
be 2(n+2).
5.3σ-Conjugacy Classes of D2n
In this subsection, we compute σ-conjugacy classes of D2n, which we will need in the next
subsection to determine all inner σ-derivations of D2n.
52Theorem 5.9. Letnbe odd. Denote |σ0(a)|=m,d=n

Proof.Clearly 1D2nσ0={1}. Letk∈ {1,...,n−1

ifg=aib, thenσ0(g)ak(σ0(g))−1=a−k. Therefore,
(ak)D2n
σ0={σ0(g)ak(σ0(g))−1|g∈D2n}={ak,a−k}.
Further, let u∈ {j0,j0+1,...,j0+r0}, wherer0is a positive integer such that

(ast≡j0(mods)).
Note that for u=j0,a2siaj0=a2sia2j0−ufor all 0≤i≤m−1 so that
(aj0b)D2n
σ0={a2siaj0b|0≤i≤m−1}.
So|(aj0b)D2nσ0|=m. Now, let u∈ {j0+1,...,j0+r0}so thatu=j0+kfor some 1 ≤k≤r0.
If possible, suppose that a2si1au=a2si2a2j0−ufor some i1,i2∈ {0,1,...,m−1}.
⇒a2s(i2−i1)=a2(u−j0).
⇒2s(i2−i1)≡2(u−j0) (modn).
⇒s(i2−i1)≡u−j0(modn) asnis odd.
⇒as(i2−i1)=a(u−j0).
⇒as(i2−i1)=akasu=j0+k.
⇒ak∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tas/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht.
Since|as|=mandd=n
m, sodis the smallest positive integer such that ad∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tas/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht.
Further, since r0< d= 1 +2r0andk∈ {1,...,r0}, sok < d. So overall, we have got that
ak∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tas/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htandkis a positive integer with k < d. But this contradicts that dis the smallest
positive integer such that ad∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tas/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht. Therefore, for u∈ {j0+ 1,...,j0+r0}, the elements
a2siaj0banda2sja2j0−ub(0≤i,j≤m−1) of the set ( aub)D2nσ0are distinct from each other.
Therefore, |(aub)D2nσ0|= 2mfor allu∈ {j0+1,...,j0+r0}.
Also, these sets ( aub)D2nσ0’s foru∈ {j0,j0+1,...,j0+r0}are pairwise disjoint and

1≤k≤n
2−1.

Foru=j0,a2siaub=a2sia2j0−ubfor all 0≤i≤m−1 so that
(aj0b)D2n
σ1={a2siaj0b|0≤i≤m−1}.
So|(aj0b)D2nσ1|=mas|a2s|=m=|as|. Now, let u∈ {j0+1,...,j0+r0}. Thenu=j0+k
for some k∈ {1,...,r0}. Leti1∈ {0,1,...,m−1}be arbitrary but ﬁxed. Then there exists
somei2∈ {0,1,...,m−1}such that
a2si1aub=a2si2a2j0−ub⇔a2s(i2−i1)=a2(u−j0)⇔a2s(i2−i1)=a2k
asu=j0+k⇔a2si3=a2k, wherei3=i2−i1⇔a2k∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta2s/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht.
As 1≤k≤r0, so 2≤2k≤2r0=d. So 2kis a positive integer ≤d. Now, if a2k∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta2s/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht,
then since 2 k∈Nwith 2k≤danddis the smallest positive integer such that ad∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta2s/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht,
therefore, the above implications will hold if and only if 2 k=d, that is, k=d
2=r0so that
u=j0+k=j0+r0.
Sincea2k∈ /a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{ta2s/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htfork=r0=d
2, so in view of the above implications, we will have that
foru=j0+r0, for every i1∈ {0,1,...,m−1}, there will exist some i2∈ {0,1,...,m−1}
such that a2si1aub=a2si2a2j0−ub. Therefore,
{a2siaub|0≤i≤m−1}={a2sia2j0−ub|0≤i≤m−1}
54so that
(aj0+r0b)D2n
σ1={a2siaj0+r0b|0≤i≤m−1}.
Then|(aj0+r0b)D2nσ1|=m. Furthermore, for 2 k < d, that is, for other values of k, that is,
fork∈ {1,...,r0−1}, that is, for u∈ {j0+ 1,...,j0+r0−1}, we will have that for each
i,j∈ {0,1,...,m−1},a2siaubanda2sja2j0−ub(0≤i,j≤m−1) are distinct elements of
(aub)D2nσ1. Therefore,
(aub)D2n
σ1={a2siaub, a2sia2j0−ub|0≤i≤m−1}
so that|(aub)D2nσ1|= 2m.
Also, these sets ( aub)D2nσ1’s foru∈ {j0,j0+ 1,...,j0+r0}are pairwise disjoint. Since

We also obtain an F-basis of Inn( FD2n).
As a consequence of Remark 2.7and the theorems obtained in this section, below is a
necessary corollary that answers the σ-twisted derivation problem for the dihedral group
algebraFD2nover a ﬁeld Fof arbitrary characteristic.
Corollary 5.13. LetFbe a ﬁeld of characteristic 0or a rational prime pandσ=σ0orσ1.
(i) If char (F) = 0or odd prime pwith gcd(n,p) = 1, then all σ-derivations of FD2nare
inner, that is, Inn σ(FD2n) =Dσ(FD2n). In other words, FD2nhas no non-zero outer
σ-derivations, that is, Out σ(FD2n) ={0}.
(ii) If char (F) = 2or char(F) =pwith gcd(n,p)/\e}atio\slash= 1, then Inn σ(FD2n)/subsetnoteqlDσ(FD2n). In
other words, FD2nhas non-zero outer σ-derivations, that is, Out σ(FD2n)/\e}atio\slash={0}.
566 Application to Coding Theory: IDD Code
In [18, Example 3.16 and Example 3.17], the authors showed the applications of derivations
to coding theory by constructing the extended binary Golay [24 ,12,8]code and the extended
binary quadratic residue [48 ,24,12] code as images of derivations of group algebras F2C24
andF2C48respectively. Here F2denotes a characteristic 2 ﬁeld of order 2 and C24,C48are
cyclic groups of orders 24, 48 respectively. For the basics of codin g theory, we refer the
reader to [ 21,28,37].
In this section, we unify the above examples into a theory of Image o f Derivation-Derived
code, written symbolically as IDD code. Let Rbe a commutative ring with unity and Gbe
a ﬁnite group of order n. We give a general construction of a group ring RGcode arising
from a subset of the image of a twisted derivation. We then constru ct an equivalent code
inRn(=R×...×R/bracehtipupleft/bracehtipdownright/bracehtipdownleft/bracehtipupright
n−times), anR-module. As an illustration of the above construction, we give
examples by constructing some codes using the twisted derivations of group algebras over
ﬁnite ﬁelds.
6.1 Construction and Deﬁnition
LetRbe a commutative unital ring and G={g1,g2,...,gn}be a ﬁnite group of order nwith
the given ordering of elements. Let σ,τbeR-algebra endomorphisms of the group algebra
RG. LetDbe a (σ,τ)-derivation of RG.
The range Im( D) ofDis anR-submodule of the R-module RGwith the generating set
D(G) ={D(gi)|1≤i≤n}. It generates an ( n,r)-code in RG, wherer= rank(Im( D)),
the rank of the R-module Im( D).
Suppose S={D(gi1),D(gi2),...,D(gis)}is anR-linearly independent subset of Im( D).
ThenSgenerates a submodule of Im( D) with rank s. Thus,Sgenerates an ( n,s)-code.
Deﬁnition 6.1. LetDbe a(σ,τ)-twisted derivation of RGandT={gk1,gk2,...,gkt},t < n
be a subset of Gsuch that D(T)is anR-linearly independent subset of RG. Then, the
submodule W=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tD(T)/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}htgenerates an (n,t)-code and is called an Image of Derivation-Derived
Code, written as IDD code. The code Wis said to have length nand dimension twhich is
the rank of the R-moduleW.
6.2 Equivalent IDD Code in Rn
Below, we give the construction of an equivalent code in Rn.
We useαto indicate that αis a vector as opposed to an element αof the group ring RG.
Forα= (λ1,λ2,...,λn)∈Rn, the mapping ζ:Rn→RGdeﬁned by
ζ(α) =n/summationdisplay
i=1λigi=α
is an element in RGaccording to the given listing of G.
For each i∈ {1,2,...,n}, suppose D(gi) =/summationtextn
j=1λijgj. Then
ζ−1(D(gi)) = (λi1,λi2,...,λin).
57Construct an n×nmatrixBwith the ﬁrst nrows as
ζ−1(D(g1)), ζ−1(D(g2)), ..., ζ−1(D(gn)).
More precisely,
B=
α11α12···α1n
α21α22···α2n
............
αn1αn2... αnn
.
Theorem 6.2. Any rows i1,i2,...,itofBare linearly independent if and only if the set
{D(θi1),D(θi2),...,D(θit)}is linearly independent.
Below, we give the steps of construction:
(i) Suppose Wis an IDD code. Then W=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tS/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht, for some R-linearly independent subset
SofD(G), say,S={D(gk1),D(gk2),...,D(gks)}.
(ii) Pick w∈Rsandw= (λ1,λ2,...,λs).
(iii) Write wasαinRnwithλjin position kjand zero elsewhere.
(iv)αcan be mapped to an element in RGbyα=ζ(α) =/summationtexts
j=1λjgkjand a codeword
D(α) =D(ζ(α)) =D(s/summationdisplay
j=1λjgkj) =s/summationdisplay
j=1λjD(gkj)
equated with a codeword in Egiven by
ζ−1(D(α)) =αB.
(v) Thus, in view of Theorem 6.2, we obtain an ( n,s) code
E={xB|xextendsw∈FstoFn}.
6.3 Examples
In this subsection, we give some examples by constructing some IDD codes using SAGE-
MATH, thus illustrating the above construction.
Example 6.3. Consider a ﬁnite ﬁeld F2tof characteristic 2 and G=C18=/a\}⌊ra⌋ketle{tx|x18= 1/a\}⌊ra⌋ketri}ht=
{1,x,...,x17}, a cyclic group of order 18.
(i)The map D:F2tC18→F2tC18deﬁned by
D(x) = 1+x+x2+x3+x4+x5+x8+x11
58and
D(xk) =k(σ(x))k−1D(x)
(1≤k≤17) is a σ-derivation of F2tC18for every group endomorphism σofC18(after
extending it F2t-linearly to the whole of F2tC18), in view of Theorem 3.15.
Below, we take σ=id(identity map), and we obtain the following binary IDD codes.

7 Conclusion
In this article, we have studied the ( σ,τ)-derivations of RGfor a commutative unital ring
Rand a group G. In Section 3, we ﬁrst obtained a necessary and suﬃcient condition under
which a map deﬁned on a generating set of a group can be extended t o aσ- and (σ,τ)-
derivation of the group ring and then characterized σ-derivations of commutative group
algebrasoveraﬁeldofpositivecharacteristic. InSection 4, westudiedinner( σ,τ)-derivations
of group algebras using ( σ,τ)-conjugacy classes in a group. We characterized all inner ( σ,τ)-
derivations of the group algebra RGof an arbitrary group Gover an arbitrary commutative
ringRin terms of the rank and a basis of the corresponding R-module of all inner ( σ,τ)-
derivations. Also, we saw that a ( σ,τ)-derivation of a group ring RGbecomes inner if the
order of the group Gis invertible in the (unital) ring R. Finally, in Section 5, we applied the
results obtained in Sections 3and4to explicitly classify all inner and outer σ-derivations
of dihedral group algebras over a ﬁeld of arbitrary characteristic . Hence, we answered the
σ-twisted derivation problem in dihedral group algebras. In Section 6, we have given the
notion (deﬁnition with construction) of an IDD code and have illustra ted it by implementing
it in SAGEMATH and constructing codes with various parameters.
