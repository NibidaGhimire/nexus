Abstract: This paper generalizes the local variance gamma model of Carr and Nadtochiy, to a piecewise
quadratic local variance function. The formulation encompasses the piecewise linear Bachelier and
piecewise linear Black local variance gamma models. The quadratic local variance function results in
an arbitrage-free interpolation of class C3. The increased smoothness over the piecewise-constant and
piecewise-linear representation allows to reduce the number of knots when interpolating raw market quotes,
thus providing an interesting alternative to regularization while reducing the computational cost.

1. Introduction
The financial markets provide option prices for a discrete set of strike prices and maturity dates. In order
to price over-the-counter vanilla options with different strikes, or to hedge complex derivatives with vanilla
options, it is useful to have a continuous arbitrage-free representation of the option prices, or equivalently of
their implied volatilities. For example, the variance swap replication of Carr and Madan consists in integrating
a specific function over a continuum of vanilla put and call option prices [Carr and Lee 2008, Carr and Madan
2001]. More generally, Breeden and Litzenberger [1978] have shown that any path-independent claim can
be valued by integrating over the probability density implied by market option prices. An arbitrage-free
representation is also particularly important for the Dupire local volatility model [Dupire 1994], where
arbitrage will translate to a negative local variance. A option price representation of class C2is also key to
guarantee the second-order convergence of numerical schemes applied to the Dupire partial differential
equation, commonly used to price exotic financial derivative contracts.
A rudimentary, but popular representation is to interpolate market implied volatilities with a cubic
spline across option strikes. Unfortunately this may not be arbitrage-free as it does not preserve the convexity
of option prices in general. A typical convex interpolation of the call option prices by quadratic splines
or rational splines is also not satisfactory in general since it may generate unrealistic oscillations in the
corresponding implied volatilities, as evidenced in [Jäckel 2014]. Kahalé [2004] designs an arbitrage-free
interpolation of the call option prices, which however requires convex input quotes, employs two embedded
non-linear minimizations, and it is not proven that the algorithm for the interpolation function of class C2
converges.
More recently, Andreasen and Huge [2011] have proposed to calibrate the discrete piecewise constant
local volatility corresponding to a single-step finite difference discretization of the forward Dupire equation.
In their representation of the local volatility, the authors use as many constants as the number of market
option strikes for an optimal fit. It is thus sometimes considered to be "non-parametric". Their technique
works well in general but requires some care around the choice of discretization grid: it must be sufficiently
dense so that two market strikes do not fall in between the same consecutive grid nodes, and sufficiently
wide to properly model the boundary behaviour. Those two requirements complicate, and slow down the
non-linear optimization involved in the technique. Furthermore the output is a discrete set of option prices,
which, while relatively dense, must still be interpolated carefully to obtain the price of options whose strike
falls in between grid nodes.
Le Floc’h and Oosterlee [2019b] derived a specific B-spline collocation to fit the market option prices,
while ensuring the arbitrage-free property at the same time. While the fit is quite good in general, it may notarXiv:2305.13791v1  [q-fin.CP]  23 May 20232 of 18
be applicable to interpolate the original quotes with high accuracy. For example, input quotes may already be
smoothed out if they stem from a prior model, or from a market data broker, or from another system in the
bank. In those cases, it is desirable to use a nearly exact interpolation.
Le Floc’h [2021] extends the local variance gamma model of Carr and Nadtochiy [2017], which relies
on a piecewise-constant representation of the local variance function, to a piecewise-linear Bachelier
representation. This paper generalizes the model to a piecewise-quadratic function. It encompasses the
piecewise-linear Bachelier and piecewise-linear Black representations. The full piecewise-quadratic model
results in an arbitrage-free interpolation of class C3for the option prices. The smoother implied probability
density allows for the use of a sparser set of interpolation knots, thus providing an alternative to regularization
in order to avoid overfitting. In addition, a sparser set of knots reduces the computational cost of the
technique.
2. Dupire’s PDDE in the local variance gamma model
We recall Dupire’s partial difference differential equation (PDDE) for a call option price C(T,x) of strike
xand maturity T[Carr and Nadtochiy 2017]:
C(T,x)−max( X(0)−x,0)
T=1
2a2(x)∂2C(T,x)
∂x2, (1)
for a Martingale asset price process X(t) of expectation EQ[X(t)]=X(0).
Let {x0,x1,...,xm,xm+1}be a increasing set of the strike prices, such that x0=L,xm+1=Uwith the
interval ( L,U) being the spatial interval where the asset Xlives. Furthermore, we require the following to hold
∃s∈[1,m]|xs=X(0).
The ( x1,...,xm) may correspond to the strike prices of the options of maturity Twe want to calibrate against,
along with the forward price as in [Carr and Nadtochiy 2017, Le Floc’h 2021]. This choice allows for a nearly
exact fit. It may also be some specific discretization of size mwith mlower or equal to the number of market
strike prices.
We consider ato be a piecewise-quadratic function of class C0on [x0,xm].
LetVbe the function defined by V(x)=C(x,T)−max (X(0)−x,0). Vis effectively the price of an
out-of-the-money option (the price of a call option for x>X(0) and of a put option for x<X(0)). The Dupire
PDDE leads to
V(x)=1
2a2(x)T£
V′′(x)+δ(x=X(0))¤
, (2)
on the interval ( L,U), where δis the Dirac delta function. Instead of solving Equation 2 directly, we look for a
solution Von the two intervals ( L,X(0)) and ( X(0),U) separately. On each interval, we have
V(x)=1
2a2(x)T V′′(x), (3)
Then, the continuity of∂C
∂xatx=X(0) implies
lim
x→X(0)−V′(x)=1+ lim
x→X(0)+V′(x). (4)
In order to define a unique V, we also impose the absorbing boundary conditions
V(L)=0=V(U). (5)
The continuity of the second derivative of Vatx=X(0) follows from the continuity of a(x) atx=X(0). We
may further impose a C3continuity relation at x=xs:

x→X(0)−µV

Using the continuity of V(xs)=Θc
s, the jump condition of V′atxsand the continuity of a(xs), theC3
condition (Equation 6) reads
1−2Θc
slimx→xs−a′(x)
a(xs)= −2Θc
slimx→xs+a′(x)
a(xs). (12)
Equation 12 implies that a′is not continuous at xs, unless a(xs)=0. The condition can not be imposed as
an additional constraint on Θc
ssince its value is already fully determined by the tridiagonal system. It may
however be imposed by choosing the correct model parameter to adjust the value of aatxsalong with its left
and right derivative values.
4. Parameterizations
4.1. Linear Bachelier
The linear Bachelier local variance consists in αi=0 and may be rewritten using values at the knots σi
as
a(x)=x−xi
xi+1−xi(σi+1−σi)+σiforxi≤x<xi+1,i=0,..., m, (13)5 of 18
where the parameters σi>0.
It corresponds to the parameterization studied in [Le Floc’h 2021], where it is shown that the local
variance function must not be C1atx=xsbut must follow C3condition (Equation 12) in order to avoid a
spurious spike at x=xs. Under the linear Bachelier local variance, the condition reads
1−2Θc
sσs−σs−1
(xs−xs−1)σs= −2Θc
sσs+1−σs
(xs+1−xs)σs,
or equivalently
σs=2Θc
s³
σs−1
xs−xs−1+σs+1
xs+1−xs´
2Θc
s³
1
xs−xs−1+1
xs+1−xs´
−1. (14)
This is not a linear problem, as Θc
sdepends on σsthrough Θc
s+1,Θs
s+1in a non-linear way (Equations 9 and 10).
Starting with the algorithm described in Section 3 to compute Θc,Θs, using Equation 14 with Θc
s≈Vmarket (xs)
as initial guess for σs, we may however apply the following iteration
• Update σsthrough Equation 14.
• Recalculate Θc
iandΘs
ifori=0,..., mby solving the updated tridiagonal system.
Three iterations are enough in practice.
4.2. Linear Black
The linear Black local variance model is defined by γ=0. The local variance function may be rewritten
using values at the knots σias
a(x)=µx−xi
xi+1−xi(σi+1−σi)+σi¶
x forxi≤x<xi+1,i=0,..., m, (15)
where the parameters σi>0. Interestingly, the C3condition (Equation 12) is also given by Equation 14.
4.3. Positive quadratic B-spline
A B-spline parameterization with positive coefficients implies apositive. Furthermore, Equation 12
imposes a double knot at x=xs(because the derivative of ais not continuous there). We thus consider
a(x)=m+3X
i=1λiBi,3(x) (16)
where λi>0 and Bi,3is the quadratic basis spline with knots t=(L,L,L,x1,x2,...,X(0),X(0),..., xm,U,U,U).
In particular, we have ts+2=ts+3=X(0). Using the B-spline derivative identity [De Boor 1978] and the fact
that the order of the B-spline is 3, we obtain
a′(x)=2X
iλi−λi−1
ti+2−tiBi−1,2(x),
and the C3condition reads
X
iλiBi,3(xs)=4Θc
sµλs+1−λs
ts+3−ts+1Bs,2(x−
s)−λs+2−λs+1
ts+4−ts+2Bs+1,2(x+

.
Using the definitions of Bi,3andBi,2we obtain
λs+1=4Θc

As an illustration, we consider the same example as in [Le Floc’h 2021]: we fit the quadratic LVG model
to 10 option prices of strikes (0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 1, 1.05, 1.1, 1.15, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4), obtained by the Black-Scholes
model with constant volatility σB=20%, time to maturity T=0.25 and forward price 1.025. We know that the
theoretical distribution is a lognormal distribution. A straightforward C1quadratic B-spline leads to a large
spike in the probability density implied from the calibrated LVG model (Figure 1). Adding the C3condition
through an additional B-spline knot recovers a smooth implied probability density.

6), fitted to a Black-Scholes model with constant volatility σB=20%, time to expiry T=0.25 and forward

5. Calibration
5.1. Error measure
The calibration of a single maturity consists in finding the parameters (the αfor the linear models, or λ
for the quadratic B-spline) such that the function C(x,T), solution of the Dupire PDDE fits the market option
prices ( ˆCi)i=1,...nof respective strikes ( Ki)i=1,...,naccording to an appropriate measure. A common practice is
to perform a least-squares minimization of the error measure Edefined by
E=mX
i=1µ2
i(σ(α,xi)−ˆσi)2, (18)
withαi>0 for i=1,..., mand where σ(α,x) is the implied volatility corresponding to the option prices
obtained with the piecewise-linear local gamma variance model and ˆσiis the market implied volatility at
strike xi, (µi)i=1,...,mare weights associated to the accuracy of the fit at each point.
In order to solve this non-linear least-squares problem, we will use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
as implemented by Klare and Miller [2013]. The box constraints αi>0 can be added in a relatively
straightforward manner to any Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, through the projection technique described
in [Kanzow et al. 2004], or through a variable transform from Rto a subset of R+(for example through the
function x→x2+ϵwith some small positive ϵ).7 of 18
The implied volatility for a given option price may be found efficiently and accurately through the
algorithm of Jäckel [2015]. In general, we prefer to solve an almost equivalent formulation in terms of option
prices, using the error measure EVdefined by
EV=mX
i=1w2
i¡
C(α,xi)−ˆCi¢2, (19)
with C(α,x) being the local variance gamma option price with parameter αand strike x, and the capped

X(0)¶
µi, (20)
where νi=∂ˆCi
∂σis the Black-Scholes Vega corresponding the market option price ˆCi, and 106is a cap applied to
avoid numerical issues related to the limited machine accuracy (see Le Floc’h [2021], Le Floc’h and Oosterlee
[2019b] for the justification).
5.2. Exact interpolation
Sometimes, it is desirable to interpolate a given set of reference prices nearly exactly. This is typically the
case when the reference prices come from some prior model. We apply the same least-square minimization
but choose the number of free parameters to be equal to the number of reference prices.
5.2.1. Linear models
For the linear models, this means to use m=nand set α0=α1andαm+1=αmto model a flat
extrapolation. In general, the market strikes will not include X(0). In this case, X(0) must be added to
the knots {xi}i=1,...,mused in the local variance gamma representation. This adds one more parameter αsto
the representation, where sis the index corresponding to X(0) in the set of knots. The value of αsis not free,
it is given by the C3condition (Equation 6) and enforced through the iterative procedure described in the
previous sections.
5.2.2. B-spline knots locations
For the linear Bachelier and Black parameterization, choosing the knots at the market strikes works well.
The situation is more complex for the quadratic B-spline parameterization.
Let ( Ki)i=1,...,nbe the market options strikes. Let the index iFbe such that KiF≤F<KiF+1. We may:
• place the knots at the market strikes (labeled "Strikes" in the figures)

The dimension of λis then nλ=n+5 ifF̸=KiFand n+4 ifF=KiF. The change in the number of
dimensions suggests that the interpolation may change significantly when the forward price moves
across a market strike.
•place the knots in the middle of market strikes. According to [De Boor 1978, p. 61], the C1quadratic
spline is then solution to a diagonally dominant tridiagonal system, which increases the stability and
reduce oscillations of the interpolation. There are however several ways to do it:

The dimension of λis then nλ=n+5.
•use a uniform discretization of [ K1,Kn] composed of n+1 points, and shift it such that the forward is
exactly part of the knots and we have nλ=n+5.
In each of those case, we make sure to add the forward price as a double knot, as well as the boundaries L,U.
The dimension of λimplied by the knots is larger than the number of market strikes. We choose the extra
parameters as such:
• ifnλ=n+5, we set λ1=λ2=λ3,λn+3=λn+4=λn+5andλiF+3is obtained from λiF+2andλiF+4.
• ifnλ=n+4, we set λ1=λ2=λ3,λn+3=λn+4andλiF+3is obtained from λiF+2andλiF+4.
• ifnλ=n+3, we set λ1=λ2,λn+2=λn+3andλiF+2is obtained from λiF+1andλiF+3.
In order to assess the various knots candidates, we consider the same example as in the previous section,
but using a few different random sets of 10 strikes in the interval [85,140] and a forward price F=101 (Table
1). The uniform discretization may2result in strong oscillations due to overfitting in places where no market

strike is quoted as in the set A (Figure 2(a)).
The "Mid-Strikes" choice leads to a strong oscillation around the forward in set B (Figure 2(b)). The
"Mid-X" produces a somewhat awkward shape on the set B. When the forward is very close to some of the
knots as in set C, the "Strikes", "Mid-Strikes" choices lead to a density with a sharp gradient near the forward,
a feature not desirable (Figure 2(c)). When the forward is part of the market strikes, a small wiggle is visible at
the forward for "Strikes" and "Mid-Strikes" (Figure 2(d)).
2In practice, market strikes are not randomly distributed, but according to multiples of a minimum strike width, with more strikes
near the money. The uniform discretization may still be relevant if some regularization is added to the objective of the minimizer.9 of 18

Finally it is also interesting to look at the overall root mean square error in implied volatilities for the
different choices (Table 2). The "Strikes" and "Mid-XX" choices consistently result in a near-perfect3fit.
Overall, the "Mid-XX" knots lead to the most stable probability density along with an excellent fit.
5.2.3. Many quotes, few parameters
In [Le Floc’h 2021], regularization is employed to ensure a smooth implied probability density when
fitting to many, eventually noisy, market option quotes. An interesting simpler alternative is to use
few knots/few parameters instead of as many parameters as market quotes: by limiting the number of
free-parameters, we may avoid overfitting issues, and at the same time we reduce the number of dimensions
of the problem, thus increasing stability and performance. Where to place the knots then? Based on the
previous observations, we may choose knots such that the market strikes are equidistributed. Concretely, we
use
˜K=©
K1,K1+j,K1+2j,...,Knª
,
where j=n/mwith m≤nand use the "Mid-XX" knots on top of ˜K. It may happen that many market strikes
are quoted in a narrow range, in which case the set could be adjusted with a minimum strike width, although
we did not need this tweak on the market examples presented below.
We consider several different underlying assets: SPX500 expiring on March 24, 2017 as March 16, 2017
(one week - 1w) and on March 7, 2018 as of February 5, 2018 (one month - 1m), TSLA of maturity July 20, 2018
as of June 15, 2018 (1m), AAPL with expiry in 4 days as of October 28, 2013 (4d) from Alexiou et al. [2021],

as as well as the AUD/NZD currency pair of maturity July 9, 2014 as of July 2, 2014 (1w) from Wystup [2018].
There is an apparent focus on short maturities as those are more difficult to capture, with a variety of smile
shapes, with some exhibiting multi-modality. The latter are particularly challenging for parametric models
such as SVI [Gatheral 2006], SABR [Hagan et al. 2002], or even polynomial stochastic collocation [Le Floc’h
and Oosterlee 2019a,b]. As the implied volatility smile flattens for long maturities, those are much easier to fit
to.

The AUD/NZD foreign exchange smile from Wystup [2018] is useful to see how the local variance gamma
model behaves on a minimalistic example: indeed, as is usual on the foreign exchange options market, it
involves only five options quotes. In this case we use as many parameters as market quotes. Figure 7(b) shows
that the density implied by the quadratic LVG model is smooth, but the one implied by the linear Bachelier
LVG model exhibits some sharp unnatural gradients near the money. Indeed, the linear LVG model leads only
to aC0probability density. Such gradients are then inevitable when the number of quotes is small. On this
example, the (unconstrained) SVI model is known to lead to some negative probability density.
In all the examples considered so far, the fit in terms of implied volatilities is excellent, and the implied
probability density is smooth, without spurious peaks, although the number of points considered ( n=10) is
somewhat arbitrary.
5.2.4. Challenging examples of exact interpolation
We consider the manufactured examples of Jäckel [2014] presented in Table A5. In the first example, a
cubic spline interpolation of option prices is known to produce oscillations in the implied volatility, while a11 of 18

cubic spline on the volatilities introduces spurious arbitrages. In the second example, some of the quotes are
at the limit of arbitrage.
On those examples, some care need to be taken in the choice of the boundaries LandU: they must be
far away enough. We pick L=K1/2 and U=2Kmwhere K1is the smallest quoted strike and Kmthe largest.12 of 18
On the example case I, the fit is nearly exact for the linear Bachelier, Black and quadratic LVG models
and there is no oscillation or wiggles in the implied volatility interpolation (Figure 8(a)). The corresponding
implied probability density is of course smoothest with the quadratic LVG model (Figure 8(b)).

On the example case II, the quadratic LVG model does not allow for an exact fit. The root mean
square error is around 4 basis points (Table 3), the fit is qualitatively good (Figure 9(a)). The near-arbitrages
impose the probability density to go to almost zero, which conflicts with the C1continuity constraints of
parameterized B-spline density. The density stays however smooth, and looks more natural than the clear
overfit of the linear LVG models (Figure 9(b)). Our choice of range for the αparameter does not allow the

implied probability densities even more similar.

6. Conclusion
The quadratic local variance gamma model with a small number of knots lead to smooth implied
probability densities on a variety of market option quotes, while providing an excellent fit in terms of implied
volatilities, even on challenging examples of non convex implied volatilities or multi-modal probability
densities.
It thus constitutes an interesting alternative to the non-parametric approaches of the linear or quadratic
local variance gamma models or of the Andreasen-Huge one-step local volatility model, which all require a
non-trivial choice of regularization constant to produce a smooth implied probability density.
In similar fashion as Falck and Deryabin [2017], it may be used as specific generic parameterization
with a fixed, small number of parameters using only 3 or 5 points. In contrast to Falck and Deryabin [2017],
where the linear parameterization leads to edges in the implied probability density and where the problem of
the discontinuity at the forward is not dealt with, the probability density of the quadratic LVG model with a
reduced number of points will be smooth.
Further research may explore the use of Fourier transforms to recover efficient pricing formulae for
European options under the local variance gamma model with a more general local variance function.

Appendix A Avoiding the use of complex numbers
We have χi=q
a(x)
αiand we know that a(x)≥0 since all the B-spline coefficients are positive, thus χiis
either real or imaginary if the sign of αiis positive (respectively strictly negative). Since V(x) involves the
ratioχi(x)/χi(xi), we may equivalently calculate χiviaχi=q
a(x)
|αi|.
From its definition, we know that ωiis real if δiT+8≥0 and imaginary otherwise.
Forziwe need to consider the two cases where the roots ˜xi,1,˜xi,2are both real or both complex.
If they are real, we havex−˜xi,1
x−˜xi,2=a(x)
αi(x−˜xi,2)2. We know that a(x)≥0 since the B-spline coefficients are all
positive. If αi>0 then ziis real, otherwise zi=ln¯¯¯x−˜xi,1
x−˜xi,2¯¯¯+iπ.
If the roots are complex with non null imaginary parts, ˜xi,1,˜xi,2are conjugates of each other. We may
write ˜xi,1=u+ivand ˜xi,2=u−ivwith ( u,v)∈R×R⋆. We have then¯¯¯x−˜xi,1
x−˜xi,2¯¯¯=¯¯x−u−iv
x−u+iv¯¯=1 and thus ziis
imaginary.
The term cosh (ωi(zi(x)−zi(xi)))is thus always real. When ωi(zi(x)−zi(xi))is imaginary, the term
sinh (ωi(zi(x)−zi(xi)))is imaginary.
To evaluate the expression V(x), there are four cases two consider:
•δi≥0 and δiT+8≥0. All the variables are real.
•δi≥0 and δiT+8<0. Take the absolute value in ωi,¯ωi=1
2r¯¯¯1+8
δiT¯¯¯. Then use sininstead of sinh .
Θs
iwill then be real instead of complex.
•δi<0 and δiT+8≥0. The logarithm in zimay be calculated using ℑ(zi(x))=arcsinh
ℑ³x−˜xi,1
x−˜xi,2´i
. The
imaginary part may be directly calculated (without complex numbers). Then use cos[¯ωiℑ(zi(x))],
sin[−¯ωiℑ(zi(x))]instead of cosh and sinh terms. Θs
iwill then be real instead of complex.
•δi<0 and δiT+8<0. The logarithm in zimay be calculated using ℑ(zi(x))=arcsinh
ℑ³x−˜xi,1
x−˜xi,2´i
. The
imaginary part may be directly calculated (without complex numbers). Then use cosh [¯ωiℑ(zi(x))],
sinh [−¯ωiℑ(zi(x))].
