We investigate self-gravitating solutions of the Einstein -Skyrme theory coupled to spin-isospin
Dirac fermions and consider the dependence of the spectral ﬂ ow on the eﬀective gravitational cou-
pling constant and on the Yukawa coupling. It is shown that th e eﬀects of the backreaction of the
fermionic mode may strongly deform the conﬁguration. Depen ding on the choice of parameters,
solutions with positive, negative and zero ADM mass may aris e. The occurrence of regular anti-
gravitating asymptotically ﬂat solutions with negative AD M mass is caused by the violation of the
energy conditions.
Introduction – There are various classical ﬁeld theories
that admit topologically stable soliton solutions. These
areparticle-likeregularlocalizedﬁeldconﬁgurationswith
ﬁnite energy. Famous examples of such topological soli-
tons in (3+1)-dimensions are monopoles in the Yang-
Mills-Higgsmodel[1,2]andSkyrmions[3,4](forreviews,
see, for example, Refs. [5, 6]).
A peculiar feature of topological solitons is the occur-
rence of fermionic zero modes localized on the soliton. In
particular, there is a link between the topological charge
of the conﬁguration and the number of zero modes [7].
Fermionicmodeslocalizedon solitonswereﬁrstdiscussed
in the pioneering work [8]. Later, it was shown that such
bound states exist on kinks [9–11], domain walls [12],
monopoles [13], sphalerons [14, 15], and Skyrmions [16–
18]. The presence of localized fermion modes gives rise
to interesting phenomena like monopole catalysis of pro-
ton decay [19, 20], emergence of superconducting cosmic
strings [21], and appearance of fractional quantum num-
bers of solitons [9, 22].
Here we would like to distinguish between two diﬀer-
ent types of fermionic zero modes that may arise in the
presence of topological solitons, depending on their prop-
erties. Ontheonehand, topologicalsolitonsmaysupport
exact fermionic zero modes that are localized on them,
independent of the Yukawa coupling strength, as is the
case, for instance, for monopoles [9]. On the other hand,
as is the case for Skyrmions, such an exact zero mode
is not supported by the topological soliton. Instead, for
Skyrmions there is a spectral ﬂow of the eigenvalues. In
particular, at some critical value of the Yukawa coupling
a fermionic mode emerges from the positive continuum,
crosseszeroandthen slowlyapproachesthe negativecon-
tinuum as the coupling grows [16–18].
A major simpliﬁcation of most of the above studies
is that, until recently, the backreaction of the fermion
mode on the soliton was not taken into account. This
assumption is justiﬁed in the weak coupling limit. How-ever, as the Yukawa coupling increases, the eﬀects of the
backreaction can be signiﬁcant, see e.g. Refs. [23–33].
As compared to boson ﬁelds, fermion ﬁelds have at-
tracted less attention in General Relativity. Although
solutions of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime were
constructed many decades ago [34], the consideration of
self-gravitating fermions still remains somewhat obscure,
because the Dirac ﬁeld can not be treated on a classical
level. Instead,oneneedstoretainitsbasicquantumchar-
acter. Typically this is done by complying with the Pauli
exclusion principle. The Dirac ﬁeld is then treated in
terms of normalizable quantum wave functions, and the
appropriate occupation number of the relevant fermion
mode(s) is imposed.
In particular, one then makes use of the approxima-
tion that (i) only single-particle fermion states are con-
sidered, (ii) second quantization of the ﬁelds is ignored,
and (iii) gravity is treated purely classically. Under these
assumptions, for instance, the fermion level crossing in
the backgroundof the Einstein-Yang-Mills sphaleronwas
considered in [35]. It turned out that self-gravitating
spinor ﬁelds may give rise to some interesting phenom-
enainthe cosmologyofthe acceleratingUniverse[36,37].
It was shown that the Einstein-Dirac equations support
regular localized solitonic solutions [38], the so-called
Dirac stars [39–43]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that
the backreaction of self-gravitating fermions may signif-
icantly aﬀect the metric and, in particular, allow for
(traversable) wormholes [44–46].
The main objective of the present Letter is to exam-
ine subject to the above stated approximation a similar
system of a spherically symmetric spin-isospin fermionic
mode localized on the self-gravitating Skyrmion, and to
study the spectral ﬂow in this system, where for consis-
tency the backreaction of the fermions on the Skyrme
ﬁeld and on the metric is taken into account.

The isospin carryingDirac ﬁeld is treated by a normal-
ized quantum wave function, and its fermionic nature is
imposed at the level of the occupation number, in accor-
dance with Pauli’s exclusion principle. Thus we consider
here a normalized single particle state to describe the
spectral ﬂow of the system consisting of a Skyrmion with
topological number one, that is interacting with a single
isospinor fermion. The spherically symmetric Ansatz for
the isospinor fermion ﬁeld localized on the Skyrmion can
be written in terms of two 2 ×2 matricesχandη[9, 53]

Numerical results – In the decoupled limit ( h→0)
the dependence of the regular self-gravitating Skyrmion
on the eﬀective gravitational coupling α2= 4πGf2
πis
well known. There are two branches of solutions which
are characterized by their limiting behavior as αtends
to zero [49–52]. The ﬁrst branch originates from the ﬂat
spacetimeSkyrmion(seethe solidpurple curvelabeled as
“Pure Skyrmion” in the inset of Fig. 1). It extends up to
a maximal value α2
max≈0.0404, where it bifurcates with
the second, upper mass branch (the dotted purple curve
in the inset of Fig. 1). The second (backward) branch
extends down to the limit α→0 which is approached
asfπ→0. Thus the sigma-model term in the Skyrme
Lagrangian ( 2) is vanishing and the conﬁguration tends
to the scaled Bartnik-McKinnon (BM) solution.
In the presence of the fermions, the limit α= 0 with
G= 0correspondstothe fermionicmodelocalizedonthe
Skyrmion in Minkowski spacetime. This mode emerges
from the positive continuum at some critical value of
the Yukawa coupling hcr≈ −0.40. Further increase of
the modulus of the Yukawa coupling decreases the scaled
eigenvalueω/|h|of the Dirac operator. For some critical
value of the coupling hthe curveω(h) then crosses zero,
as seen in Fig. 2. There is a single fermionic level which
monotonically ﬂows from positive to negative values as
the coupling decreases.
More generally, there is a family of solutions depend-
ing continuously on two parameters, the Yukawa cou-
pling constant hand the eigenvalue of the Dirac oper-/s45 /s50/s46/s48 /s45 /s49/s46/s53 /s45 /s49/s46/s48 /s45 /s48/s46/s53/s45 /s52/s45 /s50/s48/s50/s52/s54/s56

atorω, for each particular value of the eﬀective grav-
itational coupling α. Since the appearance of a single
zero crossing fermionic level is related to the underly-
ing topology of the Skyrme ﬁeld, we may expect that,
as the self-gravitating conﬁguration evolves towards the
topologically trivial BM solution, this mode undergoes a
certain transition.
For any non-zero value of the gravitational coupling,
the spherically symmetric fermionic mode localized on
the Skyrmion is no longer linked to the positive con-
tinuum, as seen in Fig. 2. Instead, it arises at some
particular value of the Yukawa coupling hmax(α)< hcr
with a scaled eigenvalue ω/|h|smaller than the thresh-
old value. Physically, this situation reﬂects the energy
balance of the system of a self-gravitating Skyrmion in-
teracting with the isospinor fermion: the added gravita-
tional interaction must be compensated by the force of
the Yukawa interaction. Notably, the spectral ﬂow of the
fermionic Hamiltonian bifurcates at this point: as hde-
creases below hmax, two branches arise as displayed in
Fig.2.
We can understand qualitatively this pattern by anal-
ogy with the appearance of two branches of solutions for
self-gravitating Skyrmions. The evolution of the conﬁgu-
ration along one branch is related to the decrease of the
Newton constant G, whereas the second branch may be
considered as being obtained by decreasing the pion de-
cay constant fπ. In both cases the eﬀective gravitational
couplingαis the same and the conﬁguration remains
in equilibrium for some particular value of the Yukawa
coupling. By analogy with the case of the usual self-
gravitating Skyrmions, we will refer to these branches of
the spectral ﬂow as the “Skyrmion branch” and the “BM
branch”, respectively. To distinguish these branches
visually, we plot them using solid (for the Skyrmion
branch)anddotted(fortheBMbranch)linesinFigs. 1-3.

branch of the spectral ﬂow still crosses zero, and the BM
branch slowly approaches zero from above, as seen in
Fig.2. Further increase of the gravitational coupling
excludes the zero eigenvalue of the Dirac operator, and
ω/|h|remains negative along both branches. On the BM
branch, it then tends to zero from below, as the Yukawa
coupling becomes stronger. Transitional branches be-
tween nodeless branches and those with one node are
the branches for the values of α≈0.14 when the spectral
ﬂow has two zeros, as seen in the inset of Fig. 2.
A rather intriguing observation is that the ADM mass
of the coupled conﬁguration becomes negative ashde-
creases along the Skyrmion branch, as seen in Fig. 3. On
the other hand, the ADM mass remains always positive
along the BM branch.
In order to get a better understanding, let us now
consider the pattern of evolution of the components of
the coupled system. Fig. 4presents the proﬁle functions
of the self-gravitating Skyrmion coupled to the localized
fermionic mode for α2= 0.1 and a set of values of the
Yukawa coupling. Note that, as hdecreases below the
critical value, labeled as the point 5 in Fig. 2, the size
of the conﬁguration on the Skyrmion branch increases.
As the scaled eigenvalue ω/hcrosses zero (the point 4)
and becomes positive, the minimal values of the metric
functionsN(r) andσ(r) are increasing.
A further increase of the strength of the Skyrmion-
fermion coupling for a ﬁxed value of αyields a very un-
usual picture: the metric function N(r) increases above
unity in the interior of the Skyrmion, while it becomes
less than unity in the outer region, as seen in Fig. 4forthe solution labeled by the point 3 in Fig. 2.
Notably, the ADM mass of the conﬁguration becomes
zero at some particular value of the Yukawa coupling, as
seeninFig. 3. Atthiscriticalpointthemetriccomponent
g00is nearly unity almost everywhere in space and the
ﬁrstderivativeofthe metricfunction Nat spatialinﬁnity
is vanishing, as displayed in Fig. 4.
As the Yukawa coupling becomes even stronger (the
point 1 in Fig. 2), the metric function N(r) is greater
than unity, except at the boundaries, and the metric
functionσ(r) becomes greater than unity in the inner
region of the conﬁguration. In contrast, the solution on
the BM branch, labeled as the point 6 in Fig. 2, behaves
as expected. The conﬁguration becomes increasingly lo-
calized by the stronger gravitational attraction.
Fig.1displays the dependence of the ADM mass of
the conﬁgurations on the eﬀective gravitational coupling
α2. As before, two branches bifurcate at some maximal
valueαmax, which increases as the absolute value of the
Yukawa coupling hbecomes larger. However, unlike the
self-gravitating Skyrmions in the decoupling limit h= 0,
we can not extend the BM branches of the solutions with
a localized fermionic mode all the way down to the limit
α→0, as seen in Fig. 1. For every BM branch, there oc-
curs some limiting value of αmin(h) for which this branch
terminates in our numerical calculations. Our calcula-
tions indicate that there might be a critical value of the
Yukawa coupling h≈ −0.79 for which the ADM mass
attains its maximum value M/α2≈11.88. This would
correspond to the minimal value of the gravitationalcou-
plingα2
min≈0.02. Correspondingly, the increase or de-
crease in the strength of the Yukawa interaction would
increasethe minimal value αmin(h), while the ADM mass
of the corresponding limiting systems would decrease, as
seen in Fig. 1. Here the dashed-dotted line then possi-
blycorrespondstothe sequenceoflimitingconﬁgurations
on the BM branch which would terminate at αminash
varies. In other words, the presence of the fermions may
possibly prohibit the BM limit. However, further numer-
ical work will be necessary to conﬁrm or refute such a
limit.
On the other hand, the domain of existence of the so-
lutions is restricted by the bifurcation points, from which
the Skyrmion and BM branches originate. These points
are connected by the critical line (the dashed line in
Fig.1) which restricts the domain of existence of the
solutions from above. This line starts at α2≈0.07
andh≈ −0.437 and extends up to the last calculated
point atα2≈1.22 andh=−2.4. In turn, in the range
−0.4/lessorsimilarh/lessorsimilar−0.437, BM branches seems to be already
absent, and only Skyrmion branchesare found, which de-
generate at h≈ −0.4 andα= 0 into one ﬂat spacetime
conﬁguration, cf. Fig. 2. Curiously, for the ﬁxed value
of the Yukawa coupling h=−1.565 there is a certain
family of conﬁgurations on the Skyrmion branch, whose
mass remains approximately constant as αvaries up to
the bifurcation point (as seen in Fig. 1).

Conclusion – Static, spherically symmetric Skyrmions
minimally coupled to gravity are the pioneering exam-
ple of solitonic and hairy black hole solutions in General
Relativity [49–52, 55, 56]. The index theorem secures
the existence of a bound fermionic mode localized on the
self-gravitating Skyrmion. However, this mode is not an
exact zero mode, independent of the Skyrmion-fermion
coupling. Instead the Skyrmion-fermion system exhibits
spectral ﬂow. In this work, we have shown that the lo-
calization of the backreacting fermionic mode may have
dramatic consequences, in particular, the energy condi-
tions maybe violated and regularself-gravitatingasymp-
totically ﬂat solutions with negative and zero ADM mass
may emerge.
