Abstract: The spin supplementary conditions are constraints on spin d egrees of freedom
in classical relativity which restricts physical degrees o f freedom to rotations. It is argued
that the equivalent constraints in quantum ﬁeld theory are t he projection conditions on
polarisation tensors, which remove timelike/longitudina l polarisations from the physical
spectrum. The claim is supported by three examples of massiv e spinning particles coupled
to electromagnetism: Dirac and Proca ﬁelds in quantum ﬁeld t heory, and N= 1 worldline
QFT for classical worldline theory. This suggests a resolut ion to the apparent discrepancy
between eﬀective ﬁeld theory description of massive higher- spin ﬁelds [ 1,2] and post-
Newtonian eﬀective ﬁeld theory of spinning classical partic les [3], where the former admits
more unﬁxed parameters compared to the latter; the addition al parameters are ﬁxed by
projection conditions and therefore are not tunable parame ters.Contents

1 Introduction
The observations of gravitational waves from compact binar y coalescence [ 4,5] have ne-
cessitated a better understanding of compact binary dynami cs, attracting practitioners of
quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) to develop QFT-inspired methods f or handling the relativis-
tic two-body problem [ 6–48]. An important aspect of relativistic two-body dynamics is
the eﬀects of spin, where QFT-inspired methods have proved to be powerful tools for their
– 1 –understanding,ascanbeinferredfromthevastnumberofrec entworksonthesubject; post-
Newtonian eﬀective ﬁeldtheory(PNEFT)[ 49–59], scatteringamplitudes[ 1,2,60–72], post-
Minkowskian eﬀective ﬁeld theory [ 73], and worldline quantum ﬁeld theory (WQFT) [ 74–
78]. Of course, each approach comes with its own shortcomings; e.g. on-shell-amplitude-
based approaches suﬀer from appearance of unphysical poles [ 79], and resolution of their
appearance is an active area of research [ 62,70,71,80–83].
Another diﬃculty is the modelling of multipolar eﬀects due to spin. Spinning compact
bodies develop multipole moments due to centrifugal forces , which for the most compact
known object of the universe is rather simple: The minimal co upling of ref.[ 79] reproduces
the multipolar structures of black holes, both for the gravi tational [ 61,62] and the elec-
tromagnetic [ 84] case. Generic compact spinning objects have richer multip olar structures,
however, and their description as point particles in QFT-in spired methods require intro-
duction of Wilson coeﬃcients, which are tunable parameters modelling the strength of the
multipoles. Recently, apuzzleregardingthecorrect numbe roftheseparameterswereraised
in ref.[2]; the number of tunable parameters for each multipole momen t in eﬀective ﬁeld
theory (EFT) of massive higher-spin ﬁelds seems to be twice o f that in PNEFT, where
a spin-induced multipole moment carries only one tunable Wi lson coeﬃcient [ 3]. More-
over, it was suggested that the diﬀerence in the number of tuna ble parameters is related
to spin supplementary conditions (SSC) [ 85]. Motivated by the confusion over SSCs and
their critical role in classical relativity, we initiate a s eries of studies that investigate the
counterparts of SSCs in QFT. This ﬁrst part of the series is de voted to understanding
the covariant SSC in the QFT context using the toy example of a spin-1 massive particle
coupled to an electromagnetic ﬁeld, see the conclusions for future directions.
The SSC in classical relativity is a “gauge” constraint on an tisymmetric rank-2 spin
tensorSµν, usuallyformassiveparticles statedinaformof Sµνuν= 0whereuµisatimelike
vector, which determines the centre of the spinning body. Th e constraint serves to reduce
the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs); while the full set of Lorentz generators have
D(D−1)
2DOFs, the physical spin only corresponds to spatial rotatio n generators belonging
to the little group which has(D−1)(D−2)
2DOFs.1The gap of DOFs is ﬁlled by D−1
independent constraints imposed by the SSC,which equals th e numberof boost generators.
Consult refs.[ 88,89] for a review on various SSCs.
In QFT, spinning particles are classiﬁed by the Wigner class iﬁcation and their spin
DOFs are describedby polarisation tensors [ 90,91]. For massive particles in the rest frame,
thephysical polarisationtensorsarepurelyspacelike ten sorstransformingirreduciblyunder
1In some QFT-based calculations this inspired the deﬁnition of the spin tensor as the boost-subtracted
Lorentz generator [ 62,86]. When compared with the contributions from the rotation ge nerators, the
contributions from the boost generators can be neglected in the large spin limit ( s→ ∞) as shown in
appendix C of ref.[ 65], therefore it is not necessary to project out the boost gene rators to deﬁne the
spin tensor when parity-symmetric spin representations ar e used. This justiﬁes the deﬁnition of the spin
tensor deﬁnition of ref.[ 1], where the spin tensor and its powers are deﬁned as Lorentz g enerators and their
symmetrised powers sandwiched between polarisation tenso rs. Note that for fully chiral spin representations
boost generators cannot be distinguished from rotation gen erators [65,87], leading to the introduction of
GEV in ref.[ 61]. JWK would like to thank Yilber Fabian Bautista for bringin g the discrepancy to attention.
– 2 –the little group SO(D−1),2which is the group of spatial rotations. This condition is al so
known as the transversality condition, wherethe contracti on of thepolarisation tensor with
the particle’s momentum is constrained to vanish; pµεµν1···νs−1(p) = 0.
However, limiting the polarisation tensors to correspond t o physical states is not
enough, as unphysical states can be excited in quantum proce sses. The polarisation ten-
sors with timelike components—which are sometimes referre d to as longitudinal polarisa-
tions—do not correspond to physical states, but such tensor s can be obtained from the
physical polarisation tensors using boost generators. Thi s observation is relevant for ver-
tex rules in Feynman diagrams; the incoming and outgoing sta tes of a single vertex have
diﬀerent momenta, therefore the overlap between physical in coming state and unphysical
outgoing state is in general nonzero, leading to excitation of unphysical DOFs that only
enters as intermediate states. Therefore, in QFT it is impor tant for the Lagrangian to have
special structures such that timelike polarisations becom e non-dynamical. For example,
the higher-spin ﬁeld Lagrangians constructed in refs.[ 92,93] contain auxiliary ﬁelds whose
sole purpose is to eliminate unphysical timelike polarisat ions from the physical spectrum.
Such constraints imposed on higher-spin Lagrangians have a n obvious parallel with the
SSC; the special structures of the free Lagrangian and the SS C serve to non-dynamicalise
DOFs that can be excited through boost generators. The aim of this paper is to argue that
the two are diﬀerent sides of the same coin; the covariant SSC, which non-dynamicalises
boost DOFs on the worldline, is equivalent to the projection conditions in QFT, which
remove from the physical spectrum the DOFs obtained by actio n of boost generators on
the physical polarisations of spinning ﬁelds. The claim is s upported by studying three
models of spinning particles coupled to electromagnetism; the massive spin-1/2 and spin-1
ﬁeldsinQFT,andWQFTformalismforclassical spinningpart icles. Theadvantageofthese
models is that the impact of SSC on the dynamics can be studied at linear order in spin,
which isof lower orderthaninthecorrespondinggravitatio nal case. Themain“observable”
is the classical Compton amplitude,3where a photon scatters oﬀ from a spinning charged
particle.
2 Quantum ﬁeld theory
The linear in spin dynamics can be studied in QFT using spin-1
2particles [ 94]. However,
Dirac spinors are insuﬃcient for studying the QFT analogue o f SSC as their equations of
motion (EOM) constrain all DOFs to be physical; the analogue of SSC is expected to be
constraints independent of mass-shell constraints that re move unphysical DOFs. On the
other hand, the theory of Dirac spinors coupled to electroma gnetism can be used as the
control group which yields the correct linear-in-spin dyna mics, as all DOFs are physical
and consideration of SSC is unnecessary.
2We limit our discussion to bosonic case for simplicity.
3The absolute square of a scattering amplitude is an observab le, but the amplitude itself is not an
observable.
– 3 –The ideal model for studying the role of SSC in the QFT context is the Proca action;
it is the simplest theory that has enough DOFs to allow unphys ical DOFs, which are the
timelike polarisations. The Proca action is given as4

2vµvµ=−1
2∂µvν∂µvν+1
2∂µvν∂νvµ+m2
2vµvµ,(2.1)
where the ﬁrst term, −1
2(∂µvν)2, combines with the mass term and gives dynamics to the
DOFs carried by thevector ﬁeld vµ. Therefore, it is appropriateto call this term the kinetic
term. On the other hand, the second term +1
2∂µvν∂νvµonly serves to non-dynamicalise
timelike polarisations of vµ, thus it will be called the projection term . The role of the
projection term can be easily studied through threshold ana lysis, where ﬁelds are only
allowed to have time dependence.

The projection term cancels the time derivatives of v0coming from the kinetic term, mak-
ing the timelike DOF v0non-dynamical. Note that without the projection term the v0
DOF develops a negative kinetic term typical of ghost ﬁelds, implying negative norm s or
violations of unitarity. This is why timelike polarisation s are generally considered as un-
physical DOFs and special care is taken to remove them from th e physical spectrum, e.g.
as in models of massive gravity [ 95].
The presence(absence) of the projection term corresponds t o imposing(lifting) the
covariant SSC on the worldline description, which will be de monstrated in the remain-
der of the paper. The amplitudes are computed in the all-inco ming convention and
D= 4 is implied whenever explicit Ddependence is not stated. Details of converting
the spinor/polarisation vector expressions to spin vector /tensor expressions can be found
in appendix A. ThexTensor package of the xActbundle [96] was used in some of the
calculations.

whereDµ=∂µ−iAµis the covariant derivative and ∆ g= (g−2) gives the anomalous

as the “mechanical momentum” πµ=pµ−eAµ.
πµ=iDµ=i∂µ+Aµ=pµ−eAµ ⇒ e=−1.(2.4)

with the usual propagator for photons. The propagator of the massive spin-1 ﬁeld can be
obtained by inverting the quadratic action. The Hparameter for the propagator and the
vertices cannot be independently tuned due to gauge constra ints.
Unlike the spinor case, there are two free parameters ( gandH) for this action. How-
ever, onlygis continuously tunable and corresponds to ∆ gof the spinor theory; for generic
H /∈ {0,1}the propagator develops poles away from p2=m2, and timelike polarisations
become dynamical with masses diﬀering from that of physical p olarisations, as can be seen
from a threshold analysis.7

The ratio of the coeﬃcients of the time derivative term and th e mass term determines
the mass-shell conditions, and timelike polarisation has t he same mass as the physical
polarisations only if H= 0. The timelike polarisation becomes non-dynamical if H= 1,
and the mass-shell condition loses its meaning.

where theuspinors satisfy the Dirac equation relation /pu(p) =mu(p). In the rest frame of
pµ, the ﬁrst term of the last line can be interpreted as the coupl ing to the scalar potential
φ[62], while the second term can be interpreted as the coupling to the magnetic ﬁeld via
the spin generator Σµν=i

7The pole of the expression obtained by contracting the propa gator eq.( 2.9) withpµpνcorresponds to
the mass-shell condition of timelike polarisations. The ti melike polarisations with mass-shell conditions
diﬀering from that of physical polarisations do not seem to h ave a corresponding worldline description.
8The identiﬁcation can be viewed as “de-quantisation” of the photon ﬁeld in the Dyson series expansion
of theS-matrix. Operationally this corresponds to demoting the an nihilation operators and momenta of
the photon ﬁeld to positive frequency components and Fourie r modes of the classical background Maxwell
ﬁeld. The idea can be extended to higher order couplings in th e background ﬁeld, e.g. ref.[ 98].

amplitude. Note that the Ward identity for the massive spin- 1 particleε1→p1is satisﬁed

deﬁned as the matrix elements of the T-matrix. This absorbs the extra sign between A3andHZ.
10This requirement is similar to but diﬀerent from higher-spi n gauge symmetry proposed in ref.[ 82]; the
higher spin gauge symmetry is intended to work for oﬀ-shell c urrents.

thatg= 2 is a special coupling [ 99], which is also the coupling of Kerr-Newman black
holes to electromagnetic ﬁelds [ 100] and the gyromagnetic ratio for the minimal coupling
amplitudes in the sense of ref.[ 79]. It may be of interest to the reader that the diﬀerences
eq.(2.26) contribute to the classical limit of one-loop integral coe ﬃcients.
– 9 –3 Worldline description from worldline QFT
In the worldline description of spinning particles, the par ticles are treated as classical
particles and the SSC can be explicitly imposed on the worldl ine action. A convenient
worldline description for studying eﬀects of SSC is the world line quantum ﬁeld theory
(WQFT) formalism [ 47,74], where the preservation of covariant SSC on the worldline
can be traded for the preservation of supersymmetry (SUSY) o n the worldline [ 75]. This
simpliﬁes the constraint equations as can be seen by writing the worldline translation
generator as Hand writing the preservation conditions as
{Sµνuν,H} ≃0 (D−1 conditions, SSC) v.s. {Q,H} ≃0 (1 condition, SUSY)
where≃is an equality up to the spin order of interest. The reduction in the number of
constraint equations shows the advantage of the WQFT descri ption.
Tocompare the QFTamplituderesults with worldline-based c alculations, aWQFT ac-
tion with (broken) N= 1SUSY is constructed. Since it is known that ( g−2) can beviewed
as a measure of SUSY breaking [ 101], and considering the fact that CEin the gravitational
case could be tuned by a “soft” SUSY breaking operator which a llowed approximate con-
servation of SUSY charges, we expect two sets of operators th at contribute to ( g−2) in the
electromagnetic case; the “soft” breaking term which appro ximately preserves the SUSY
charges, and the “hard” breaking term which do not preserve t he SUSY charges in any
sense. The expectation is that the “soft”(“hard”) breaking corresponds to H= 1(H= 0)
of vector QED, since SUSY preservation is interpreted as SSC preservation [ 75].

ν,{ψµ,ψν}=−iηµν,{θ,θ}= +i, (3.2)
and the “mechanical momentum” πµis deﬁned as
πµ=pµ−qAµ⇒ {πµ,πν}=qFµν. (3.3)

13Following ref.[ 75], the Grassmann variable for the compactiﬁed direction is d enoted as θ, and the
momentum pϕdual to the compactiﬁed coordinate ϕis ﬁxed as a constant pϕ=m. The momentum
variable pρfor the Grassmann variable ρis deﬁned using the right derivative pρ:=−δS

This spin tensor deﬁnition is justiﬁed since the algebra sat isﬁed bySµν=−iψµψνis
identical to the one by orbital angular momentum tensor Lµν=xµpν−xνpµ.

While the algebra of Sµνis canonical which implies the canonical SSC [ 103], the dynamics
ofSµνisdiﬀerent from that expected for the canonical SSC and follows the cova riant
SSC instead [ 75]. Sincemis constant and ϕdecouples from the rest of the variables, the
compactiﬁed direction kinetic term m˙ϕcan be dropped when studying the dynamics.
The expectation for g∝ne}ationslash= 2 (which corresponds to non-vanishing “ﬁnite-size” eﬀects
CE∝ne}ationslash= 0 in the gravitational context) is that SUSY is broken [ 101] and there are two sets
of worldline operators responsible for SUSY breaking; the o ne that preserves the SSC (the
“soft” SUSY breaking), and the one that does not preserve the SSC (the “hard” SUSY
breaking).14The soft breaking term is expected to break SUSY at O(ψ3) or higher orders
in Grassmann variables, while the hard breaking term is expe cted to break SUSY at O(ψ2)
or lower orders. Starting from the ansatz for ( g−2) interaction Hg−2,
Hg−2=c1Fµνψµψν+c2(π·ψ)Fµνπµψν

the SUSY variation on Hg−2yields;

14It is known that a theory with g∝negationslash= 2cannotbe double copied to a gravitational theory because the
coupling of spin to gravity is universal [ 62,104,105]. Therefore this term is irrelevant for double-copy
construction of integrands for gravitational dynamics [ 102].

3.2 Derivation of Feynman rules
To derive the Feynman rules, the worldline ﬁelds are decompo sed into their background
values and their ﬂuctuations.
xµ=bµ+vµτ+zµ(τ),
ψµ= Ψµ+ψ′µ(τ).(3.17)
Whenever an expression quadratic in the background Grassma nn ﬁeld Ψµappears, it will
be written using the background spin tensor Sµν=−imΨµΨνinstead.
The boundary conditions on the ﬂuctuation ﬁelds zµandψ′µdetermine the boundary
conditions of their propagators. The boundary condition fo r Feynman propagators corre-
sponds to the symmetric boundary condition for the ﬂuctuati on ﬁelds [ 75]. The worldline
ﬂuctuation ﬁelds and the gauge ﬁeld are expanded in terms of p ositive frequency modes18

The Feynman rules can be read out by expanding the worldline a ction eq.( 3.16) in ﬂuctu-
ation ﬁelds eq.( 3.17) and inserting the mode expansions eq.( 3.18).
18In the classical theory, this sign choice guarantees analyt icity of (causal) worldline ﬂuctuations on the
upper half plane of ωspace, provided that worldline ﬂuctuations are polynomial ly bounded in τ.
19Note that outgoing convention was used for the same expansion in ref.[ 75].

4 Conclusion
The match in the classical limit between WQFT Compton amplit udes eq.( 3.27) and vector
QED Compton amplitudes eq.( 2.25), especially the match between the eﬀect of SSC break-
ing term in WQFT amplitudes eq.( 3.28) and the eﬀect of removing the projection term
in vector QED amplitudes eq.( 2.26), supports the view that imposing covariant SSC on
the worldline description of spinning particles is equival ent to removing unphysical time-
like polarisations from the physical spectrum of higher-sp in ﬁelds. Interestingly, on-shell
methods do not suﬀer from this problem since unphysical polar isations are removed from
the get-go, although the results generally suﬀer from unphys ical intermediate states in the
form of unphysical poles which need to be removed by other mea ns [62,70,71,81]. Fur-
thermore, let us stress that the unphysical DOFs have an impa ct on classical observables
if they are not projected out at the level of the Lagrangian.22
The view that covariant SSC and physical state projection co nditions are equivalent
has immediate consequences. One consequence is that it sugg ests a possible resolution to
the puzzle raised in EFT description of massive higher-spin ﬁelds for binary dynamics [ 2].
In this construction, two families of operators modelling s pin-multipole eﬀects were found
to contribute independently to classical dynamics. Wherea s one family of operators—the
21This factor can be absorbed by rescaling the delta constrain tm−1¯δ(k·v) =¯δ(k·mv) =¯δ(k·p).
22Or if the propagators do not have proper projectors, when the QFT is understood in the Weinbergian
sense [106] where the Lagrangian is simply a means of obtaining consist ent interaction vertex rules. Main-
taining gauge invariance can become nontrivial in this appr oach; the Hparameter dependence in vector
QED is an example of projectors aﬀecting the vertex Feynman r ules.
– 16 –C-type operators—have corresponding counterparts in the wo rldline theory of spinning
particles introduced in ref.[ 3], the other family of operators—the H-type operators—do
not have corresponding counterparts, which seems to imply a n apparent doubling of the
numberoftunableparameters. Theviewsuggests that themis match isduetonot imposing
the transversality conditions on the massive higher-spin ﬁ elds [1,2], and that removing the
unphysical timelike polarisations from the physical spect rum will induce additional con-
straints on unﬁxedparameters such that the number of tunabl e parameters will match that
of PNEFT. Another consequence is that the view oﬀers a guiding principle for constructing
WQFT action of spinning particles with higher order spin-in duced multipole moments; the
operators are chosen so that SUSY is broken as “softly” as pos sible.
One method of removing unphysical timelike polarisations f rom the physical spectrum
is to introduce St¨ uckelberg ﬁelds [ 95]. Therefore it is likely that the higher-spin gauge
symmetry of ref.[ 82], which uses St¨ uckelberg ﬁelds for gauge symmetry, automa tically im-
plements the physical state projection conditions. It woul d be interesting to check if the
doubling of tunable parameters observed in ref.[ 2] is resolved when higher-spin gauge sym-
metry is imposed, i.e. the higher-spingauge symmetry allow s at most onefree parameter to
be tuned at each spin-multipole moment order. Moreover, exp licitly studying the higher-
spin case wouldalso clarify if thediscontinuous massless l imit [107,108] makes aqualitative
diﬀerence from the vector QED case.23Another interesting future direction would be to
elaborate on the Thomas-Wigner rotation factor associated with the deﬁnition of the po-
larisation tensor [ 65,66], which has an eﬀect of switching from the covariant SSC to the
canonical SSC, in a more general setup.
We conclude this paper with a curious observation regarding the gyromagnetic ratio
and classical scattering amplitudes. The ( g−2)2dependence of the diﬀerence eq.( 2.26)
impliesthattheoverlapbetweenphysicalexternal statesa ndunphysicalintermediatestates
is proportional to ( g−2), i.e.∝an}bracketle{tψunphys|ψphys∝an}bracketri}ht ∝(g−2). Weinberg has commented that
exponentiation of the eikonal amplitude for g∝ne}ationslash= 2 holds when a sum rule constraining
the anomalous magnetic moment ∆ g= (g−2) to the amplitudes for radiative decay is
satisﬁed [ 109]. The two statements are similar in that both are statements about ∆gof
scattering amplitudes in the classical limit, and that both relate ∆gto transitions between
observed states and unobserved states.

The Thomas-Wigner rotation factor [ 65,66] is irrelevant for the Compton amplitude and
has been neglected.
B Symplectic structure of Grassmann variables
Consider the following Lagrangian for the Grassmann variab lea.
L=i
2a˙a−V(a). (B.1)
– 18 –The canonical momentum is deﬁned by a right derivative;
pa:=−δL
δ˙a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
R=−ia
2. (B.2)
This means the momentum variable paisnotindependent from the position variable a,
and this equation should be considered as a primary constrai ntφ1which is weakly zero
(φ1≃0).
φ1:=pa+ia
2≃0. (B.3)
Due to the sign choice for pa, the Hamiltonian is given as
H=−pa˙a−L=V(a). (B.4)
The non-vanishing Poisson brackets {•,•}are given as
{a,pa}= +{pa,a}= 1, (B.5)
where the sign factor is due to the graded nature of the algebr a for Grassmann variables.
Using Hamiltonian EOM {f,H}=˙f, the following secondary constraint is obtained.
φ2=˙φ1={φ1,H}={pa,V(a)}=∂V(a)
∂a/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle
L≃0. (B.6)
The secondary constraint φ2vanishes under the Poisson bracket since it is independent o f
aandpa,24which means that φ2is a ﬁrst-class constraint. On the other hand, the primary
constraintφ1has a nonvanishing Poisson bracket with itself, which means thatφ1is a
second-class constraint;
{φ1,φ1}={pa+ia
2,pa+ia
2}=i. (B.7)
This is troublesome since the points on the constraint surfa ceφ1= 0 get transported away
from the constraint surface by the momentum map of the vector ﬁeld{•,φ1}, thereby
making the constraint condition no longer preserved. There fore the Poisson bracket is
modiﬁed into the Dirac bracket to make φ1vanish under the brackets. The Dirac bracket
{•,•}∗is deﬁned as;
{P,Q}∗:={P,Q}−{P,φ1}[{φ1,φ1}]−1{φ1,Q}={P,Q}+i{P,φ1}{φ1,Q}.(B.8)
We ﬁnd
{a,a}∗= +i,{a,pa}∗= 1/2,{pa,pa}∗=−i/4, (B.9)
which is consistent with the constraint φ1=pa+ia/2≃0. The Poisson brackets in eq.( 3.2)
for Grassmann variables should be understood as Dirac brack ets.
24A function f(η) of a Grassmann variable ηcan be at most linear in η.
– 19 –C Fixing zeros of handHparameters
Theh= 0 case of the WQFT ∆ gterm eq.( 3.13) can be argued to be equivalent to the
H= 0 case of vector QED action eq.( 2.8) by attempting to write it as a worldline action,
following a procedure similar to that of ref.[ 110]. Up to total derivatives, the vector QED
action forH= 0 can be written as
L=v†
α/bracketleftBig
(DµDµ+m2)δα
β−g
2Fµν/braceleftBig
iηµαδν
β−iηναδµ
β/bracerightBig/bracketrightBig
vβ+···, (C.1)
where ellipsis denotes terms irrelevant for equations of mo tion of the ﬁeld vµ. Writing the
covariant derivative as the mechanical momentum Dµ=−iπµand the terms inside the
curly brackets as the spin generator Σµν, the action can be written as
L=−v†
α/bracketleftBig
(πµπµ−m2)δα
β−ge
2Fµν(Σµν)α
β/bracketrightBig
vβ+···, (C.2)
where the charge of the particle e=−1 has been restored. The terms inside the square
brackets of eq.( C.2) matches the worldline Hamiltonian H+H∆g,hwithh= 0 up to an
overall factor.

It is unclear if this procedure of generating worldline acti ons from QFT actions can be
generalised when projection conditions are imposed, e.g. f orH= 1 case of eq.( 2.8). In
ref.[110] gauge-ﬁxing terms were tuned to remove the projection term s of the Maxwell
action.
D Classical equations of motion from the WQFT Hamiltonian
The classical equations of motion can be obtained by substit utingSµν=−iψµψνinto the
worldline Hamiltonian Htot=H+H∆g,h=1;

portional to the covariant SSC, and O(S2) denotes terms quadratic in spin. Note that
the last equation is the BMT equation [ 111]. SSC is preserved due to {παSαβ,Htot}=
O(S2)+O(παSαβ).
