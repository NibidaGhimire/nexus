K-contact manifolds
Vladimir Rovenski∗
Abstract
We study metric structures on a smooth manifold (introduced in our recent works [11, 12]
and called a weak contact metric structure and a weak K-contact structure) which generalize
the metric contact and K-contact structures, and allow a new look at the classical theory.
First, we characterize weak K-contact manifolds among all weak contact metric manifolds
by the property well known for K-contact manifolds, and ﬁnd when a Riemannian manifold
endowed with a unit Killing vector ﬁeld forms a weak K-contact structure. Second, we
ﬁnd suﬃcient conditions for a weak K-contact manifold with parallel Ricci tensor or with a
generalized Ricci soliton structure to be an Einstein manifold.

1 Introduction
The growing interest in contact geometry is associated with its important role in mechanics in
explaining physical phenomena. In addition, many recent ar ticles have been motivated by the
questionofhowinterestingself-similarsolutionsoftheR icciﬂowequation, i.e., Riccisolitons, can
be for contact metric geometry. Some of them ﬁnd conditions w hen a contact manifold equipped
with a Ricci-type soliton structure carries a canonical (e. g., Einstein or constant curvature)
metric, e.g. [2, 6, 8, 10].
K-contact manifolds (i.e., contact metric manifolds whose R eeb vector ﬁeld is Killing) have
been studied by several geometers, e.g., [1, 13], and it is se en that the K-contact structure is
intermediate between the contact and Sasakian structures. The Reeb vector ﬁeld ξof theK-
contact structure is a unit Killing vector ﬁeld, and the inﬂu ence of constant length Killing vector
ﬁelds on the Riemannian geometry has been studied by several authors from diﬀerent points
of view, e.g., [3, 5, 9]. An interesting result related to the above question is that a K-contact
manifold equipped with generalized Ricci soliton structur e has an Einstein metric, e.g., [6].
In [12], we introduced the “weakened” metric structures on a smooth manifold (replacing the
complex structure on the characteristic distribution with a nonsingular skew-symmetric tensor).
They generalize the metric contact, K-contact, Sasakian and cosymplectic structures, and allow
a new look at the classical theory. In [12], we build retracti on of weak structures with positive
partial Ricci curvature onto the set of classical structure s. In [11] (where the deﬁnition of weak
structures is a bit more general than in [12]), we proved that the weak Sasakian structure is
weakK-contact; and a weak almost contact metric manifold is weak S asakian if and only if it
is a Sasakian manifold. In this article we study weak K-contact manifolds using their sectional
and Ricci curvature in the ξ-direction. Our goal is to show that the weak K-contact structure
can be a useful tool for studying unit Killing vector ﬁelds on Riemannian manifolds, and that
some results for K-contact manifolds can be extended to the case of weak K-contact manifolds.
For example, we answer the question of when a weak K-contact manifold carries a generalized
Ricci soliton structure or just an Einstein metric.

1The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, following the introductory Section 1, we
recall basics of weak contact metric manifolds. Next three s ections contain the main results. In
Section 3, we characterize (in Theorem 3.1) weak K-contact manifolds among all weakly contact
metric manifolds by the property ϕ=−∇ξ(well known for K-contact manifolds), and ﬁnd (in
Theorem 3.2) when a Riemannian manifold endowed with a unit K illing vector ﬁeld forms a
weakK-contact structure. In Section 4, for a weak K-contact manifold, we calculate (in Propo-
sition 4.1) the Ricci curvature in the ξ-direction, then ﬁnd (in Theorem 4.1) suﬃcient condition
for such a manifold with parallel Ricci tensor to be an Einste in manifold. In Section 5, we ﬁnd
(in Theorem 5.1) suﬃcient conditions for a weak K-contact manifold admitting a generalized
Ricci soliton structure to be an Einstein manifold.
2 Preliminaries
Here, we recall basics of some metric structures that genera lize the almost contact metric struc-
ture (see [12], or, equivalently, [11] with ν= 1). A weak almost contact structure on a smooth
manifold M2n+1is a set ( ϕ,Q,ξ,η ), where ϕis a rank-(1,1) tensor, Qis a nonsingular (1 ,1)-
tensor,ξis the Reeb vector ﬁeld and ηis a dual 1-form, i.e., η(ξ) = 1, satisfying
ϕ2=−Q+η⊗ξ, Qξ =ξ. (1)
The form ηdetermines a smooth 2 n-dimensional distribution D:= kerη, the collection of
subspaces Dm={X∈TmM:η(X) = 0}form∈M. We assume that Disϕ-invariant,
ϕX∈ D, X∈ D, (2)
as in the theory of almost contact structure [1, 13], where Q= idTM. By (1) and (2), our
distribution Dis invariant for Q:Q(D) =D. If there is a Riemannian metric gonMsuch that
g(ϕX,ϕY) =g(X,QY)−η(X)η(Y), X,Y ∈XM, (3)
then (ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g ) is called a weak almost contact metric structure onM, andgis called a
compatible metric. A weak almost contact manifold M(ϕ,Q,ξ,η ) endowed with a compati-
ble Riemannian metric gis called a weak almost contact metric manifold and is denoted by
M(ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g ). Some suﬃcient conditions for the existence of a compatibl e metric on a weak
almost contact manifold are given in [12].
PuttingY=ξin (3) and using Qξ=ξ, we get, as in the classical theory, η(X) =g(ξ,X).
In particular, ξisg-orthogonal to Dfor any compatible metric g.
By (3), we get g(X,QX) =g(ϕX,ϕX)>0 for any nonzero vector X∈ D, thusQis positive
deﬁnite. For a weak almost contact structure on a smooth mani foldM, the tensor ϕhas rank
2nand
ϕξ= 0, η◦ϕ= 0, η◦Q=η,[Q, ϕ] = 0;
moreover, for a weak almost contact metric structure, ϕis skew-symmetric and Qis self-adjoint.
Aweak contact metric structure is deﬁned as a weak almost contact metric structure satisfy-
ing Φ = dη(thus,dΦ = 0), where Φ( X,Y) =g(X,ϕY) (X,Y∈XM) is called the fundamental
2-form, and
dη(X,Y) =1
2{X(η(Y))−Y(η(X))−η([X,Y])}, X,Y ∈XM, (4)

Remark 2.1. A diﬀerential k-formon a manifold Mis a skew-symmetric tensor ﬁeld ωof type

called the exterior diﬀerential ofω. Note that (4) and (5), e.g., [1], correspond to (6) with k= 1
andk= 2.
For a weak contact metric structure, the distribution Dis non-integrable (has no integral
hypersurfaces), since g([X,ϕX],ξ) = 2dη(ϕX,X) =g(ϕX,ϕX)>0 for any nonzero X∈ D.
The Nijenhuis torsion [ ϕ,ϕ] ofϕis given by
[ϕ,ϕ](X,Y) =ϕ2[X,Y]+[ϕX,ϕY]−ϕ[ϕX,Y]−ϕ[X,ϕY], X,Y ∈XM.
A weak almost contact structure ( ϕ,Q,ξ,η ) is called normalif the following tensor is zero:
N(1)(X,Y) = [ϕ,ϕ](X,Y)+2dη(X,Y)ξ, X,Y ∈XM. (7)
The following tensors N(2),N(3)andN(4)are well known in the classical theory, see [1, 13]:
N(2)(X,Y) = (£ϕXη)(Y)−(£ϕYη)(X)(4)= 2dη(ϕX,Y)−2dη(ϕY,X),
N(3)(X) = (£ξϕ)X= [ξ,ϕX]−ϕ[ξ,X],
N(4)(X) = (£ξη)(X) =ξ(η(X))−η([ξ,X])(4)= 2dη(ξ,X).
Remark 2.2. LetM(ϕ,Q,ξ,η ) be a weak almost contact manifold. Consider the product
manifold ¯M=M×R, whereRhas the Euclidean basis ∂t, and deﬁne tensor ﬁelds ¯ ϕand¯Qon
¯Mputting
¯ϕ(X, a∂t) = (ϕX−aξ, η(X)∂t),
¯Q(X, a∂t) = (QX, a∂ t),
wherea∈C∞(M). Thus, ¯ ϕ(X,0) = (ϕX,0),¯Q(X,0) = (QX,0) forX∈kerϕ, ¯ϕ(ξ,0) = (0,∂t),
¯Q(ξ,0) = (ξ,0) and ¯ϕ(0,∂t) = (−ξ,0),¯Q(0,∂t) = (0,∂t). By the above, ¯ ϕ2=−¯Q. The tensors
N(i)(i= 1,2,3,4) appear when we derive the integrability condition [¯ ϕ,¯ϕ] = 0 (vanishing of
the Nijenhuis torsion of ¯ ϕ) and express the normality condition N(1)= 0 of a ( ϕ,Q,ξ,η ) onM.
Theorem 2.1 (see [11] with ν= 1).a)For a weak almost contact metric structure (ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g ),
the vanishing of N(1)implies that N(3)andN(4)vanish and N(2)(X,Y) =η([˜QX, ϕY]).
b)For a weak contact metric manifold, the tensors N(2)andN(4)vanish and the trajectories
ofξare geodesics, i.e., ∇ξξ= 0; moreover, N(3)≡0if and only if ξis a Killing vector ﬁeld.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (see [11] with ν= 1).Two weak almost contact structures ( ϕ,Q,ξ,η ) and
(ϕ′,Q′,ξ,η) onMare said to be homothetic if the following is valid for some re alλ >0:
ϕ=√
λ ϕ′, (8a)
Q|D=λQ′|D. (8b)
Two weak contact metric structures ( ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g ) and (ϕ′,Q′,ξ,η,g′) onMare said to be ho-
mothetic if they satisfy conditions (8a,b) and
g|D=λ−1
2g′|D, g(ξ,·) =g′(ξ,·). (8c)
Lemma 2.1 (see [11] with ν= 1).Let(ϕ,Q,ξ,η )be a weak almost contact structure such that
Q|D=λidD,
for some real λ >0. Then the following is true:
•(ϕ′,ξ,η)is an almost contact structure, where ϕ′is given by (8a).
•If(ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g )is a weak contact metric structure, and ϕ′,g′satisfy(8a,c), then(ϕ′,ξ,η,g′)
is a contact metric structure.
3AweakK-contact manifold is deﬁned as a weak contact metric manifold whose Reeb vector
ﬁeldξis Killing (or, inﬁnitesimal isometry, e.g., [7]), i.e.,
(£ξg)(X,Y) :=ξ(g(X,Y))−g([ξ,X],Y)−g(X,[ξ,Y]) =g(∇Xξ,Y)+g(∇Yξ,X) = 0.(10)
Here£ξis the Lie derivative in the ξ-direction and ∇is the Levi-Civita connection. A normal
weak contact metric manifold is called a weak Sasakian manifold . Recall that a weak Sasakian
structure is weak K-contact, see [11, Proposition 4.1], furthermore, a weak al most contact
metric structure is weak Sasakian if and only if it is homothe tic to a Sasakian structure, see [11,
Theorem 4.1].
The relationships between the diﬀerent classes of weak struc tures (considered in this article)
can be summarizes in the diagram (well known in the case of cla ssical structures):

A “small” (1,1)-tensor ˜Q=Q−id is a measure of the diﬀerence between a weakly contact
structure and a contact one, and ˜Q= 0 means the classical contact geometry. Note that
[˜Q,ϕ] = 0 and ˜Qξ= 0.
Lemma 2.2 ([11] with ν= 1).For a weak contact metric manifold, we get
g((∇Xϕ)Y,Z) =1
2g(N(1)(Y,Z),ϕX) +g(ϕX,ϕY)η(Z)−g(ϕX,ϕZ)η(Y)+1
2N(5)(X,Y,Z),
(11)
where the skew-symmetric with respect to YandZtensorN(5)(X,Y,Z)supplements the se-
quence of tensors N(i)(i= 1,2,3,4)and for a weak contact metric manifold is given by
N(5)(X,Y,Z) = (ϕZ)(g(X,˜QY))−(ϕY)(g(X,˜QZ))
+g([X,ϕZ],˜QY)−g([X,ϕY],˜QZ)+g([Y,ϕZ]−[Z,ϕY]−ϕ[Y,Z],˜QX).
Remark 2.3. For a contact metric structure, (11) (with N(5)= 0) gives the result in [1,
Corollary 6.1]. Note that only one new tensor N(5)is needed for further study of a weak contact
metric structure. In particular, by (11), we get g((∇ξϕ)Y,Z) =1
2N(5)(ξ,Y, Z) and
N(5)(X,ξ,Z) =g(N(3)(Z),˜QX),
N(5)(ξ,Y,Z) =g([ξ,ϕZ],˜QY)−g([ξ,ϕY],˜QZ),
N(5)(ξ,ξ,Z) =N(5)(ξ,Y,ξ) = 0. (12)
3 Unit Killing vector ﬁelds
Proposition 3.1. On a weak K-contact manifold, we get N(1)(ξ,·) = 0and
N(5)(ξ,·,·) =N(5)(·, ξ,·) = 0, (13)
£ξ˜Q=∇ξ˜Q= 0, (14)
∇ξϕ= 0. (15)
Proof.By (7) and dη(ξ,·) = Φ(ξ,·) = 0 we get
N(1)(ξ,X) = [ϕ,ϕ](X,ξ) =ϕ2[X,ξ]−ϕ[ϕX,ξ] =ϕN(3)(X) = 0.
By [11, Lemma 3.1] with ν= 1 and h=1
2N(3)= 0, we get N(5)(ξ,·,·) = 0,£ξ˜Q= 0 and
g(Q∇Xξ,Z) =g(ϕZ,QX)−1
2N(5)(X,ξ,ϕZ).
By (12) 1withN(3)= 0, we get N(5)(·,ξ,·) = 0. We use [ ϕ,˜Q] = 0 to obtain ∇ξ˜Q= 0:
(£ξ˜Q)X= [ξ,˜QX]−˜Q[ξ,X] = (∇ξ˜Q)X+[ϕ,˜Q]X= (∇ξ˜Q)X.
This completes the proof of (13) and (14). Next, from (11) wit hX=ξwe get (15).
4In the next theorem, we characterize weak K-contact manifolds among all weak contact
metric manifolds by the following well known property of K-contact manifolds, see [1]:
∇ξ=−ϕ. (16)
Theorem 3.1. A weak contact metric manifold is weak K-contact (that isξis a Killing vector
ﬁeld)if and only if (16)is valid.
Proof.Let a weak contact metric manifold satisfy (16). By skew-sym metry of ϕ, we get
(£ξg)(X,Y) =g(∇Xξ,Y) +g(∇Yξ,X) =−g(ϕX,Y)−g(ϕY,X) = 0, thus, ξis a Killing
vector ﬁeld.
Conversely, let our manifold be weak K-contact. By (11) with Y=ξ, usingN(1)(ξ,·) = 0
andN(5)(X,ξ,Z) = 0, see (13), we get
g((∇Xϕ)ξ,Z) =1
2g(N(1)(ξ,Z),ϕX)−g(ϕX,ϕZ) +1
2N(5)(X,ξ,Z) =g(ϕ2X,Z).
Hence, (∇Xϕ)ξ=ϕ2X. From this and 0 = ∇X(ϕξ) = (∇Xϕ)ξ+ϕ∇Xξ, we obtain ϕ(∇Xξ+
ϕX) = 0. Since ∇Xξ+ϕX∈ Dandϕis invertible when restricted on D, we get that ∇Xξ=
−ϕX.
If a plane contains ξ, then its sectional curvature is called ξ-sectional curvature . It is well
known that the ξ-sectional curvature of a K-contact manifold is constant equal to 1. Recall that
a Riemannian manifold with a unit Killing vector ﬁeld and the property RX,ξξ=X(X⊥ξ) is
aK-contact manifold, e.g., [13, Theorem 3.1] or [1, Propositi on 7.4]. We generalize this result
in the following
Theorem 3.2. A Riemannian manifold (M2n+1,g)admitting a unit Killing vector ﬁeld ξwith
positiveξ-sectional curvature is a weak K-contact manifold M(ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g )with the following
structural tensors: η(X) =g(X,ξ),ϕ=−∇ξ, see(16), andQX=RX,ξξforX∈kerη.
Proof.Letη=g(·,ξ) andD= kerη. PutϕX=−∇XξandQX=RX,ξξforX∈ D. Sinceξ
is a Killing vector ﬁeld, we obtain the property dη= Φ for Φ( X,Y) =g(X,ϕY):
dη(X,Y) =1
2(g(∇Xξ,Y)−g(∇Yξ,X)) =−g(∇Yξ,X) =g(X,ϕY).
Sinceξis a unit Killing vector ﬁeld, we get ∇ξξ= 0 and ∇X∇Yξ−∇∇XYξ=Rξ,XY. Thus,
ϕξ= 0 and
ϕ2X=∇∇Xξξ=Rξ,Xξ=−QX(X∈ D).
PutQξ=ξ. Therefore, (1) is valid, and Qis positive deﬁnite, that completes the proof.
Example 3.1. By Theorem 3.2, we can search for examples of weak K-contact (not K-contact)
manifolds among Riemannian manifolds of positive sectiona l curvature that admit unit Killing
vector ﬁelds. Indeed, let Mbe a convex hypersurface (ellipsoid) with induced metric gof the
Euclidean space R2n+2,
M=/braceleftBig
(u1,...,u 2n+2)∈R2n+2:/summationdisplayn+1

i= 1/bracerightBig
,
where 0 < a=const/ne}ationslash= 1 and n≥1 is odd. The sectional curvature of ( M,g) is positive. It
follows that
ξ= (−u2,u1,...,−un+1,un,−√aun+3,√aun+2,...,−√au2n+2,√au2n+1)
is a Killing vector ﬁeld on R2n+2, whose restriction to Mhas unit length. Since ξis tangent to
M(i.e.,Mis invariant under the ﬂow of ξ), soξis a unit Killing vector ﬁeld on ( M,g), see [5,
p. 5]. For n= 1, we get a weak K-contact manifold M3=/braceleftbig
u2
1+u2

⊂R4with
ξ= (−u2,u1,−√au4,√au3).
5Other examples of weak K-contact (not K-contact) manifolds are obtained from [3, Theo-
rem 12]: “On every sphere S2n−1, n≥2, for any ε >0 there exists a (real analytic) Riemannian
metricgofcohomogeneity 1anda(realanalytic)Killingvector ﬁeld ξofunitlengthon( S2n−1,g)
such that
1) all sectional curvatures of ( S2n−1,g) diﬀer from 1 by at most ε;
2) the vector ﬁeld ξhas both closed and non-closed integral trajectories”.
Corollary 3.1. A weak K-contact structure (ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g )with constant positive ξ-sectional
curvature, K(ξ,X) =λ >0for some λ=const∈Rand allX∈ D, is homothetic to a
K-contact structure (ϕ′,ξ,η,g′)after the transformation (8a-c).
Proof.Note that K(ξ,X) =λ(X∈ D) if and only if RX,ξξ=λX(X∈ D). ByQX=
RX,ξξ(X∈ D), see Theorem 3.2, we get QX=λX(X∈ D). By Lemma 2.1(ii), ( ϕ′,ξ,η,g′) is
a contact metric structure. Using (10), we get ( £ξg′)(X,Y) =λ(£ξg)(X,Y) (X,Y∈ D) and
(£ξg′)(ξ,·) = 0. By £ξg= 0, we get £ξg′= 0; thus ( ϕ′,ξ,η,g′) is aK-contact structure.
4 The Ricci curvature in the characteristic direction
Denote by RX,YZthe curvature tensor and by Ric♯the Ricci operator of gassociated with the
Ricci tensor Ric and given by Ric( X,Y) =g(Ric♯X,Y) for allX,Y∈XM. The Ricci curvature
in theξ-direction is given by Ric( ξ,ξ) =/summationtext2n
i=1g(Rei,ξξ,ei), where ( ei) is any local orthonormal
basis ofD.
In the next proposition, we generalize three particular pro perties of K-contact manifolds to
weakK-contact manifolds.
Proposition 4.1. For a weak K-contact manifold, the following equalities are true:
Rξ,XY= (∇Xϕ)Y, (17)
RX,ξξ=−ϕ2X, (18)
Ric(ξ,ξ) = trace Q= 2n+trace˜Q. (19)
Proof.Using (16), we derive
RZ,Xξ=∇Z(∇Xξ)−∇X(∇Zξ)−∇[Z,X]ξ)
=∇X(ϕZ)−∇Z(ϕX)+ϕ([Z,X]) = (∇Xϕ)Z−(∇Zϕ)X. (20)
Note that ( ∇XΦ)(Y,Z) =g((∇Xϕ)Z,Y) =−g((∇Xϕ)Y,Z). Using condition dΦ =d2η= 0,
we get
(∇XΦ)(Y,Z)+(∇YΦ)(Z,X) +(∇ZΦ)(X,Y) = 0. (21)
From (20), using (21) and skew-symmetry of Φ, we get (17):
g(Rξ,XY,Z) =g(RY,Zξ,X)(20)= (∇ZΦ)(X,Y)+(∇YΦ)(Z,X)
(21)=−(∇XΦ)(Y,Z) =g((∇Xϕ)Y,Z).
By (17) with Y=ξ, usingϕξ= 0 and (16), we ﬁnd
Rξ,Xξ= (∇Xϕ)ξ=−ϕ∇Xξ=ϕ2X.
This and (1) 1yield (18). By this, for any local orthonormal basis ( ei) ofD, we get
Ric(ξ,ξ)(18)=−/summationdisplay2n
i=1g(ϕ2ei,ei)(1)=/summationdisplay2n
i=1g(Qei,ei).
By the above and the equality trace Q= 2n+trace˜Q, (19) is true.
6Note that if a Riemannian manifold admits a unit Killing vect or ﬁeldξ, thenK(ξ,X)≥
0 (X⊥ξ, X/ne}ationslash= 0), thus Ric( ξ,ξ)≥0; moreover, Ric( ξ,ξ)≡0 if and only if ξis parallel:
∇ξ≡0, for example, [9]. In the case of K-contact manifolds, K(ξ,X) = 1, see [1, Theorem 7.2].
Corollary 4.1. For a weak K-contact manifold, the ξ-sectional curvature is positive:
K(ξ,X) =g(QX,X)>0 (X∈ D,/ba∇dblX/ba∇dbl= 1), (22)
therefore, for the Ricci curvature we get Ric(ξ,ξ)>0.
Proof.For any unit vector X∈ D, by (18), we get
0< g(ϕX,ϕX) =−g(ϕ2X,X) =g(QX,X),
thusK(ξ,X)>0 and trace Q >0. Therefore, from (19) we get the statement.
By Theorem 3.2 and Corollary 4.1, using [12, Corollary 3], we conclude the following.
Corollary 4.2. A weakK-contact manifold M(ϕ,Q,ξ,η,g 0)admits a smooth family of metrics
gt(t∈R), such that M(ϕt,Qt,ξ,η,g t)are weak K-contact manifolds with certainly deﬁned ϕt
andQt; moreover, gtconverges exponentially fast, as t→ −∞, to a limit metric ˆgthat gives a
K-contact structure.
The following theorem generalizes a well known result, e.g. , [13, Proposition 5.1].
Theorem 4.1. A weakK-contact manifold with conditions (∇Ric)(ξ,·) = 0 (in particular,
the Ricci tensor is parallel )andtraceQ=constis an Einstein manifold of scalar curvature
(2n+1)trace Q.
Proof.Diﬀerentiating (19) and using (16) and the conditions, we get
0 =∇Y(Ric(ξ,ξ)) = (∇YRic)(ξ,ξ)+2Ric( ∇Yξ,ξ)) =−2Ric(ϕY,ξ)),
hence Ric( Y,ξ) =η(Y)Ric(ξ,ξ) =η(Y)traceQ. Diﬀerentiating this, then using
X(η(Y)) =g(∇Xξ,Y) =−g(ϕX,Y)+g(∇XY,ξ)
and assuming ∇XY= 0 atx∈M, gives
(traceQ)g(ϕY,X) =∇X(Ric(Y,ξ)) = (∇XRic)(Y,ξ)+2Ric( Y,∇Xξ) =−2Ric(Y,ϕX),
hence Ric( Y,ϕX) = (trace Q)g(Y,ϕX). Therefore, we obtain
Ric(X,Y) = (trace Q)g(X,Y)
for any vector ﬁelds XandYonM, which means that ( M,g) is an Einstein manifold. Using
the deﬁnition of scalar curvature, τ= trace Ric, we ﬁnd τ= (2n+1)trace Q.
Remark 4.1. For a weak K-contact manifold, by (17) and ∇ξϕ=1
2N(5)(ξ,Y, Z) = 0, see
Remark 2.3 and (13), we get the following equality (well know n forK-contact manifolds, e.g.,
[1]):
Ric♯(ξ) =/summationdisplay2n
i=1(∇eiϕ)ei,
where (ei) is any local orthonormal basis of D. ForK-contact manifolds, this gives Ric♯(ξ) =
2nξ, see [1, Proposition 7.2], and Ric( ξ,ξ) = 2n; moreover, the last condition characterizes
K-contact manifolds among all contact metric manifolds.

Each equation above is a generalization of the Einstein metr ic, Ric+λg= 0. For diﬀerent values
ofc1, c2andλ, equation (23) is a generalization of Killing equation ( c1=c2=λ= 0), equation
for homotheties ( c1=c2= 0), Ricci soliton equation ( c1= 0, c2=−1), vacuum near-horizon
geometry equation ( c1= 1, c2= 1/2), e.g., [6].
First, we formulate some lemmas.
Lemma 5.1. For a weak K-contact manifold we get
(£ξ(£Xg))(Y,ξ) =g(X,Y)+g(∇ξ∇ξX,Y)+Yg(∇ξX,ξ)
for all smooth vector ﬁelds X,YwithYorthogonal to ξ.
Proof.This uses the equalities ∇ξξ= 0 and (18), and is the same as for [6, Lemma 3.1].
Lemma 5.2 (see, for example, [6]) .Let(M;g)be a Riemannian manifold and f∈C∞(M).
Then the following holds for every vector ﬁelds ξ,YonM:
£ξ(df⊗df)(Y,ξ) =Y(ξ(f))ξ(f)+Y(f)ξ(ξ(f)).
Recall that the Ricci curvature of any K-contact manifold satisﬁes the following condition:
Ric(ξ,X) = 0 (X∈ D). (25)
Lemma 5.3. Let a weak K-contact manifold satisfy (25)and admit the generalized gradient
Ricci soliton structure (24). Then
∇ξ∇f= (λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)ξ−c1ξ(f)∇f.
Proof.This uses (19) and (24) and is analogous to the proof of [6, Lem ma 3.3]. By (19) and
(25) we get
λη(Y)+c2Ric(ξ,Y) = (λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)η(Y). (26)
Using (24) and (26), we get
Hessf(ξ,Y) =−c1ξ(f)g(∇f,Y)+(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)η(Y). (27)
Thus, (27) and the condition (24) for the Hessian complete th e proof.
The next theorem generalizes [6, Theorem 3.1].
Theorem 5.1. Let a weak K-contact manifold with trace˜Q=constsatisfy the generalized
gradient Ricci soliton equation (24)withc1(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)/ne}ationslash=−1. Suppose that condition
(25)is true. Then f=const. Furthermore, if c2/ne}ationslash= 0, then the manifold is an Einstein one.
8Proof.LetY∈ D. Then by Lemma 5.1 with X=∇f, we obtain
2(£ξ(Hessf))(Y,ξ) =Y(f)+g(∇ξ∇ξ∇f,Y)+Yg(∇ξ∇f,ξ). (28)
Using Lemma 5.3 in (28) and the properties ∇ξξ= 0 and g(ξ,ξ) = 1, yields
2(£ξ(Hessf))(Y,ξ) =Y(f)+(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)g(∇ξξ,Y)
−c1g(∇ξ(ξ(f)∇f),Y)+(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)Y(g(ξ,ξ))−c1Y(ξ(f)2)
=Y(f)−c1g(∇ξ(ξ(f)∇f),Y)−c1Y(ξ(f)2). (29)
Using Lemma 5.3 with Y∈ D, from (29) it follows that
2(£ξ(Hessf))(Y,ξ) =Y(f)−c1ξ(ξ(f))Y(f)+c2
1ξ(f)2Y(f)−c1Y(ξ(f)2).(30)
Sinceξis a Killing vector ﬁeld, thus £ξg= 0, this implies £ξRic = 0. Using the above fact
and applying the Lie derivative to equation (24), gives
2(£ξ(Hessf))(Y,ξ) =−2c1(£ξ(df⊗df))(Y,ξ). (31)
Using (30), (31) and Lemma 5.2, we obtain
Y(f)/parenleftbig
1+c1ξ(ξ(f))+c2
1ξ(f)2/parenrightbig
= 0. (32)
By Lemma 5.3, we get
c1ξ(ξ(f)) =c1ξ(g(ξ,∇f)) =c1g(ξ,∇ξ∇f) =c1(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)−c2
1ξ(f)2.(33)
Using (32) in (33), we get Y(f)(c1(λ+ 2c2n+c2trace˜Q) + 1) = 0. This implies Y(f) = 0
provided by c1(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)+1/ne}ationslash= 0. Hence, ∇fis parallel to ξ. Taking the covariant
derivative of ∇f=ξ(f)ξand using (16), we obtain
g(∇Z∇f,Y) =Z(ξ(f))η(Y)−ξ(f)g(ϕZ,Y), Z,Y∈XM.
From this, by symmetry of Hess f, i.e.,g(∇Z∇f,Y) =g(∇Y∇f,Z), we get ξ(f)g(ϕZ,Y) = 0.
ForY=ϕZfor some Z/ne}ationslash= 0, since g(ϕZ,ϕZ)>0, we get ξ(f) = 0; so ∇f= 0, i.e. f=const.
Thus, from (24) and c2/ne}ationslash= 0 we conclude that the manifold is an Einstein manifold.
Remark 5.1. The following generalization of gradient Ricci soliton equ ation was given in [8]:
Hessf1=−c1df2⊗df2+c2Ric+λg (34)
for some functions f1,f2∈C∞(M) and real c1,c2andλ. Forf1=f2, (34) reduces to (24).
Let a weak K-contact manifold with trace ˜Q=constsatisfy (25) and admit the generalized
Ricci soliton structure (34) with c1(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)/ne}ationslash=−1. Then similarly to Lemma 5.3,
we get
∇ξ∇f1= (λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)ξ−c1ξ(f2)∇f2. (35)
Using (35) and Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2, and slightly modifying the proof of Theorem 5.1, we ﬁnd
that the vector ﬁeld ∇fis parallel to ξ, wheref=f1+c1(λ+ 2c2n+c2trace˜Q)f2. Thus
df= 0, i.e.,
df1=−c1(λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q)df2.
Using this in (34) and denoting a:=λ+2c2n+c2trace˜Q, we get
−c1aHessf2=−c1df2⊗df2+c2Ric+λg. (36)
Then we obtain the following assertion (with three cases) th at generalizes Theorem 5.1.
1. Ifc1a/ne}ationslash= 0, then (36) reduces to
Hessf2=1
adf2⊗df2−c2
c1aRic−λ
c1ag.
9By Theorem 5.1, if c1a/ne}ationslash=−1, thenf2=const; moreover, if c2/ne}ationslash= 0, then ( M,g) is an Einstein
manifold.
2. Ifa= 0 and c1/ne}ationslash= 0, then (36) reduces to
0 =c2Ric−c1df2⊗df2+λg.
Ifc2/ne}ationslash= 0 andf2/ne}ationslash=const, then we get a gradient quasi Einstein manifold. The concept of a quasi
Einstein manifold was introduced in [4] by the condition Ric (X,Y) =ag(X,Y)+bµ(X)µ(Y)
for all vector ﬁelds X,Y, whereaandb/ne}ationslash= 0 are real scalars, and µis a 1-form of unit norm.
3. Ifc1= 0, then (36) reduces to 0 = c2Ric+λg, and for c2/ne}ationslash= 0 we get an Einstein manifold.
6 Conclusion
It is shown that the weak K-contact structure is a useful tool for studying unit Killin g vector
ﬁelds on Riemannian manifolds and that some results for K-contact manifolds can be extended
to the case of weak K-contact manifolds. Inspired by [1, Theorems 7.1 and 7.2], t he following
question can be posed: is the condition (22), or the weaker co ndition (19), suﬃcient for a weak
contact metric manifold to beweak K-contact? To answer the question, some well known results
for contact metric manifolds, such as [1, Proposition 7.1], must be generalized for weak contact
metric manifolds. In conclusion, we pose the following ques tions (about “weak” analogues of
resultsmentionedin[6, Remark3.2]): isacompact weak K-contact EinsteinmanifoldaSasakian
manifold? Thus, is a compact weak K-contact manifold admitting generalized Ricci soliton
structure a Sasakian manifold?
