1 Introduction
Measurements of a given observable are at the origin of the probabilistic nature of quan-
tum mechanics: despite a system is prepared in identical conditions, its measurement can
1arXiv:2302.08209v2  [hep-th]  25 Jul 2023provide different outcomes. Therefore, it is interesting to study the full probability distri-
bution function (PDF) of an observable in any quantum mechanical system, especially when
the first few moments do not provide a good description of the distribution. Quantify these
PDFs, or equivalently their full counting statistics (FCS), has become of increasing relevance
in one-dimensional quantum many-body systems, through exact derivations, both in and out
of equilibrium, and in inhomogeneous systems (the interested readers can consult the com-
prehensive literature on the subject [1–34], from equilibrium setups to charge transport).
This large number of theoretical works about the FCS has been also motivated by the re-
cent groundbreaking advances with cold atom experiments [35–41]. Shifting the attention
to observables with support on a finite, but large, subsystem embedded in a thermodynamic
system provides a further motivation for studying the FCS: indeed, it turned out to be strictly
related to the entanglement entropy of the same subsystem [42–54] and so it provides indirect
information about the latter. This interplay will be relevant in our work, too, especially for
the connections between the FCS and the entanglement entropy in a given charge sector in
the presence of a global symmetry.
In order to make this connection explicit, we remind here the definition of the FCS. We
consider an extended quantum system in a pure state |Ψ⟩, defined in a bipartite Hilbert space
H=HA⊗H B, where HAandHBare respectively associated to two spatial regions AandB.
The reduced density matrix, ρA, obtained by taking the partial trace to the complementary
subsystem as ρA= Tr B(|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|), describes the state in A. We take as an observable a charge
operator Qgenerating a U(1)symmetry group, such that it is the sum of the charge in each
region, Q=QA+QB(although this ultralocality condition is not required for the FCS it is
fundamental for the symmetry resolved entanglement [57]). The FCS is defined as
Z1(α) = Tr[ ρAeiαQA]. (1.1)
The FCS is the Fourier transform of the PDF of the charge QA. We observe that in this case
Z1(α)is also equal to Tr[ρ eiαQA], while this equivalence breaks down when we consider
Zn(α) = Tr[ ρn
AeiαQA]. (1.2)
The latter quantities are know as charged moments of the reduced density matrix [55]. These
objects have played a crucial role in the study of the symmetry resolution of the entangle-
ment [56–58]. As we will show in the following sections, if |Ψ⟩is an eigenstate of Q, then
[ρA, QA] = 0andρAdisplays a block-diagonal structure in the charge sectors of QA, labelled
by its eigenvalues q. Then, the moments of ρArestricted to the qcharge sector are the Fourier
transform of Zn(α)defined in Eq. (1.2) [57,58]. Also when [ρA, QA]̸= 0, quantities analogous
to (1.2) provide crucial information about the system of interest [59,60].
In this manuscript, we are interested in the study of both the FCS and the charged
moments of two species of massless complex fermions or bosons in one dimension coupled
together via a conformal interface. A similar analysis has been done in Refs. [61] and [62] to
compute the total Rényi entanglement entropies [63],

and the entanglement negativity [64] among an arbitrary number of fermionic and bosonic
species, respectively. In both cases, we have found that these entanglement measures show
a logarithmic growth with the system size, and the universal prefactor depends both on the
details of the interface and the bipartition. This is consistent with the crucial result that, for
free massless theories, the conformal junction is equivalent to a marginal defect [65], and so
can alter the leading behaviour of the entanglement measures [66–79]. Given the success of
2the entanglement entropies in the description of the universality and of the relevance of the
parameters defining the junction, it is natural to wonder whether this also occurs both for the
probability distribution of the charge and for the entanglement resolved in the different charge
sectors. We address this problem here by studying two different kinds of free systems, which
provide an ideal framework to perform exact computations both analytically and numerically.
Main result: We summarise here the main results of this paper so that the reader can
easily find them without dealing with all technical details of the derivation. For a system of
free fermions with an interface parametrised by the transmission probability Tand when the
subsystem Ais one of the two halves of the system on one side of the defect, we show that
the charged moments defined in Eq. (1.2) behave at leading order in the system size, L, as

where again the prefactor of the logarithmic term does depend on T, n, α, but in a different
way with respect to the fermionic case. These results generalise what obtained in Ref. [62]
forα= 0and in Ref. [85] in the absence of the defect (i.e. T= 0and arbitrary α). Beyond
the originality of the results, we also stress that the techniques we use here is based on the
evaluation of the spectral density of the correlation matrix ( ρX′

FCS in Eq. (1.1). Even though the leading order behaviour of the charged moments can be
derived using different and easier approaches, as we will show in the main text (especially for
n= 1), we stress that the merit of our procedure is that it immediately gives the result for
any real value of n, without the need of any complicated analytic continuation. This allows
us to straightforwardly evaluate the symmetry resolution of the entanglement, which is the
second main result of this manuscript. In this respect, we show that, at leading order in L,
the symmetry resolved entanglement is equally distributed among the different charge sectors,
and the presence of the interface does not affect the equipartition of the entanglement [58].
Outline: The structure of the manuscript is the following. In Sec. 2, we consider a free
fermion gas in which the presence of the interface introduces a marginal perturbation. The
interface boundary conditions are defined by a specific scattering matrix S, and we can exploit
the gaussianity of the model to compute both the FCS and the charged moments through
the correlation matrix of the system and, especially, its spectral density. This approach
immediately provides a result for the charged moments in Eq. (1.2) for any non-integer n
index and, as a byproduct of our findings, we can also study the symmetry resolution of
the entanglement in this setup. In Sec. 3, we tackle the problem of two coupled complex
3massless Klein-Gordon field theories. By using the same techniques adopted in the fermionic
case, we are able to evaluate the spectral density of the correlation matrix and consequently
our main quantities of interest, i.e. the FCS, the charged moments, and, eventually, the
symmetry resolved entanglement. In both cases, we validate our predictions with exact lattice
computations. Finally, we draw our conclusions in Sec. 4 and we include two appendices about
the technical details of our results.

the fermionic case. Closely following Ref. [61,77], we first review the construction of the model
and its correlation matrix. Then, we report the explicit computation for the spectral density.
We conclude the section with the study of the symmetry resolution of the entanglement.
2.1 The Schroedinger junction
In this section, we analyse a fermion gas on a junction made up of 2wires of length L, joined
together through a single defect described by a non-trivial scattering matrix. Each point of
the junction is parametrised by a pair
(x, j), x∈[0, L], j = 1,2, (2.1)
where jis the index identifying the wire and xthe spatial coordinate along the wire. The
bulk hamiltonian of the system is

(∂xΨj(x)), (2.2)
with Ψj,Ψ†
jbeing the fermionic fields associated to the j-th wire (also called Schroedinger
field, from which the name Schroedinger junction). We consider a scattering matrix
S=√
1− T√

, (2.3)
describing the defect at x= 0, where Tplays the role of a transmission probability. When
T= 1, the junction becomes completely transmissive, while when T= 0, it is a reflective
boundary. The explicit relation between the scattering matrix Sand the boundary conditions
for the fields at x= 0is
λ(1−S)Ψ(0) −i(1 +S)∂xΨ(0) = 0 , (2.4)
where Ψ ={Ψj}j=1,2andλis an arbitrary real parameter with the dimension of mass (we
refer to Ref. [77] for further details).
To completely specify the problem, we have to specify also the boundary conditions at
x=L, that we choose to be Dirichlet, namely
Ψj(L) = 0 , j = 1,2. (2.5)
A convenient strategy to tackle this system is the introduction of a set of uncoupled nonphys-
ical fields φj(x)[80,81]. For instance, we first diagonalise Sthrough a unitary transformation
U, and its eigenvalues are just ±1. Then, we define the unphysical fields {φj(x)}as
Ψi(x) =2X
j=1Uijφj(x). (2.6)
4The boundary conditions of these new fields at the defect can be
∂xφj(0) = 0 , φ j(0) = 0 , (2.7)
hence they are either Neumann or Dirichlet, if the eigenvalue of the matrix Sis1or−1,
respectively.
From now on, we focus on the ground state of such system with 2Nparticles, and we
repeat the main steps done in [61] in order to find a finite-dimensional representation of the
correlation functions. This allows us to compute efficiently the main quantities of interest
in this manuscript, e.g. the FCS, or more generally, the charged moments. The correlation
functions of the two nonphysical fields φj(x)are just the ones of a single Fermi gas made by
Nparticles, with boundary condition Neumann-Dirichlet (ND) or Dirichlet-Dirichlet (DD)
at the two points x= 0, Lrespectively. Going back to the original fields, one eventually
expresses the correlation function of Eq. (2.2) as

CND(x, y) =sinN

2L+ (y→ −y).(2.9)
Here, we use the symbol C′for the correlation function at transmission probability T, and
we denote with Cthe one obtained for T= 1(in the absence of the defect).
We have reported the result for the correlation function (2.8) as continuous kernel of the
spatial variables. It is more useful to work with a finite-dimensional representation of such
correlations, which is equivalent to the overlap matrix approach [82]. The main result is the
matrix representation of the kernel as

with Qbeing a N×Nmatrix defined by
Qn,n′=2n
π(n2−(n′−1/2)2). (2.11)
A detailed derivation for Eq. (2.10) can be found in [61] and in the appendix A. This result
has a very convenient form for the restriction of C′to the subsystem Agiven by the first wire,
denoted here by C′
A. For instance, if Aonly consists of the first wire, it is sufficient to restrict
the correlation matrix over its element S11and one finally gets C′

If we restrict Ato the second wire, we could find a similar result.

model. A well known result is that the leading behavior of the FCS for T= 1, i.e. in the

2π2
logN+O(1), α∈[−π, π], (2.15)
valid in the limit N≫1, and it is periodic under α→α+ 2π. The expression above is the
starting point of our analysis, as it will be helpful to relate it with other quantities in the
presence of the defect.
2.2 Spectral density
Here, we investigate the spectral density of C′
A, that is its density of eigenvalues, a crucial
quantity from which we can eventually extract the charged moments through Eq. (2.14).
We first introduce the matrices
EA=CA(1−CA), E′
A=C′
A(1−C′
A), (2.16)
where CA(C′
A) refers to the absence, T= 1, (presence, T<1) of the defect. Since the
correlation matrices satisfy
0≤CA≤1,0≤C′
A≤1, (2.17)
the corresponding EA, E′
Amatrices are bounded as
0≤EA≤1/4,0≤E′
A≤1/4, (2.18)
namely their eigenvalues belong to [0,1/4]. A fundamental relation between EAandE′
A,
which comes directly from the definition in Eq. (2.10) (see Refs. [61,77] for the proof and also
the appendix A.1), is
E′
A=TEA. (2.19)
The spectral properties of these matrices are conveniently encoded in the resolvent, defined
as
GEA(y)≡Tr1

A(y)≡Tr1

where we have subtracted the term 1/yto discard explicitly the contributions coming from
y= 0. This term does not contribute to the universal terms of the full-counting statistics (see
Eq. (2.14)) or the Rényi entropies we are interested in (see also [84] for the discussion about
the non-universal term related to ⟨QA⟩without defects). Indeed, we can express the density
of eigenvalues as

6i.e. we inserted an additional normalization factor logNin the denominator to ensure a finite
limit for N≫1.
In order to compute the spectral density of C′
A, we adopt the following procedure. We
first compute GEA(y)from the FCS Z1(α), and we obtain the spectral density for EA. Then,
through Eq. (2.19), we get the spectral density of E′
A, eventually related to the one of C′
A
by Eq. (2.16). We start with an expression for the resolvent, obtained from Eq. (2.14) with
straightforward algebra, that is
GEA(y) = 2d
dylogZ1(α(y)), (2.23)
where the relation between αandyis given by y=1
4 sin2(α/2). Inserting Eq. (2.15) in the
previous equation, we obtain the resolvent in the absence of the defect as
GEA(y)
logN=1
y3/2arcsin1
2√y
π2p
1−1/4y. (2.24)
The expression above shows explicitly the presence of a branch-cut along y∈[0,1/4], that is
the support of EA, which is the signal of a continuous spectral density. By using the relations

2,(2.25)
valid for y∈(0,1/4), we express the spectral density as
ρEA(y) =1
π21
y√1−4y, y∈[0,1/4], (2.26)
while it vanishes elsewhere. For T= 1, we plot this function in the left panel of Fig. 1. We
now consider T<1, i.e. the presence of the defect, and using Eq. (2.19) we get
GE′
A(y) =GEA(y/T), ρ E′
A(y) =1
TρEA(y/T). (2.27)
In particular, it is worth to observe that the support of spectral density with the defect is
shrunk to y∈[0,T/4](see the left panel of Fig. 1).
The last step is the computation of the spectral density of C′
A, from the one of E′
A, as
a consequence of Eq. (2.16). Here, we have to be careful as the relation between the two
matrices is not invertible and two distinct eigenvalues of C′
Acorrespond to a single eigenvalue
ofE′
A. Thus, we first focus on the region z <1/2, and the transformation law of densities
gives
ρC′
A(z) =1
2dy
dz
ρE′
A(y(z)), (2.28)
where the relation between zandyis
y=z(1−z). (2.29)
Moreover, due to the particle-hole symmetry, namely C′
A→1−C′
A, we have that ρC′
A(z)is
symmetric around z= 1/2, that is
ρC′
A(z) =ρC′
A(1−z), (2.30)
and from Eq. (2.28) we obtain the result also for z≥1/2. We now put everything together,
and we get
ρC′
A(z) =

0,otherwise .(2.31)
7A remarkable observation is that ρC′
A(z)has a spectral gap for T<1, while, as Tapproaches
1the gap closes, and the resulting spectral measure becomes
ρCA(z) =1
2π2z(1−z), z∈(0,1). (2.32)
This mechanism is depicted in the right panel of Fig. 1, which shows the analytical predictions
for the spectral densities of C′
AandE′
Afor different values T.
Figure 1: The spectral densities of E′
A(left panel) and C′
A(right panel) as functions of the
spectral parameter, for different values of the transmission probability T. They correspond
to the Eqs. (2.26) and (2.31), respectively.
We mention that our finding in Eq. (2.31) is not completely new because a similar result
was already provided in a slightly different context in Ref. [42]. We also remark that our
results are expected to be valid only in the thermodynamic limit N→ ∞; for instance, for
any finite N, the matrix C′
Ahas2Neigenvalues and its spectral density would be given by a
sum of 2Ndelta-functions centered around the eigenvalues.
Now that we have an explicit expression for the spectral density ρC′
A(z), we can compute
every function which depends on the spectrum of C′
A. In particular, we are interested in the
charged moments (see Eq. (2.13)), which read
−logZ′

logN=−Z1
0dz ρ C′
A(z) log( zneiα/2+ (1−z)ne−iα/2), (2.33)
a relation which holds for any value of n(even non-integer). As a byproduct, for n= 1and
T= 1, the integral (2.33) gives α
2π2, in agreement with Eq. (2.15). On the other hand,
whenT<1, we find
−logZ′
1(α) = 
arcsin (√
Tsin(α/2))
π!2
logN+O(1), (2.34)
which is the leading term of the FCS in the presence of a defect. Notice that the same result
can be obtained in a much simpler way, using the relation in Eq. (2.19), which amounts to
the replacement
sin2(α/2)→ T sin2(α/2), (2.35)
in Eq. (2.15). We mention that the prediction in Eq. (2.34) is compatible with previous results
already obtained by conformal field theory methods in Ref. [61]. However, this trick does not
generalise to n̸= 1and the derivation presented above is necessary.
In Fig. 2 we benchmark the coefficient of the logarithmic term of the charged moments
as follows. We fix T= 0.36, and for any α∈[−π, π]we compute numerically the charged

moments, for several values of Nup to 200. We fit the obtained numerical results with
alogN+b0+b1N−1. Fig. 2 reports the best fit of aas a function of αand compares it
to the corresponding analytic result in Eq. (2.33), finding perfect agreement. We verify the
agreement for any real value of n, since Eq. (2.33) provides an analytic continuation of the
charged moments in n. We also observe that the agreement between the numerics and our
theoretical prediction worsens for α→ ±π, as it also occurs in the absence of the defect [84].
2.2.1 Alternative derivation of Zn(α)for integer n
While in the derivation above we have never assumed nto be an integer and the calculation
is valid for nreal, a simpler strategy can be employed when nis integer. Indeed, thanks to
the identity
(xneiα/2+yne−iα/2) =(n−1)/2Y
p=−(n−1)/2(xei
2(α/n+2πp/n )+ye−i
2(α/n+2πp/n )),(2.36)
it is possible to show from the definition in Eq. (2.13) that (see also [85,86])
Z′
n(α) =(n−1)/2Y
p=−(n−1)/2Z1(2πp/n +α/n), (2.37)
where the product is over the integers/semi-integers pfornbeing odd/even. We mention
that the same relation at α= 0has been employed in Ref. [61] to compute the (uncharged)
moments of the reduced density matrix ρA, and here we provide a natural generalisation.
Inserting our prediction (2.34) in the previous expression, we finally get

92.3 Symmetry resolved entropies
As we already mentioned in the introduction, a very recent research line in many-body quan-
tum systems is to understand how the entanglement organises into the various symmetry
sectors of a theory [57]. In the presence of a global conserved charge Q, the reduced density
matrix can be decomposed as ρA=⊕qP(q)ρA(q)in the eigenbasis of the charge restricted to
the subsystem A,QA, and P(q)is the probability of finding qas an outcome of the measure-
ment of QA(i.e. P(q)is the Fourier transform of the FCS). The knowledge of the charged
moments allows us to access the symmetry resolved moments as
Zn(q)≡Tr(Π qρn
A) =Zπ
−πdα
2πe−iαqTr(ρn
AeiαQA), (2.39)
where Πqis the projector in the charge qsector, which are the eigenvalues of QA. The
symmetry resolved entropies are defined as
Sn(q)≡1
1−nln Trρn
A(q) =1
1−nln TrZn(q)
Zn
1(q). (2.40)
Remarkably, the symmetry resolved entanglement has been recently experimentally accessed

In order to evaluate Sn(q), we expand the charged moments near α= 0as follows
−logZ′
n(α) = (An(T) +Bn(T)α2+O(α4)) log N+. . . , (2.41)
with An(T)andBn(T)being universal positive constants depending on nandTonly. The
explicit expressions of those constants are
An(T) =Z1

corresponding integral is localized near to α≃0, we obtain

This analysis shows that, whenever qis kept fixed in the limit N→ ∞, the non-vanising terms
are independent of q, a scenario which has been dubbed equipartition of entanglement [58].
Indeed, the first non-trivial correction to equipartition appears as a contribution of order
∼q2/logN(a similar correction can be found in a different context in [90]).
3 Free bosons
In this section, we consider a junction obtained by two wires, each one hosting a complex
bosonic field. We follow closely Ref. [62], giving a brief review of the model and the employed
techniques. Then, the evaluation of the correlation matrix and of its spectral density provides
the necessary tools for the computation of the FCS and the charged moments.

Φj(L) = Π j(L) = 0 , (3.2)
while the scale-invariant scattering matrix Sin Eq. (2.3) describes the mixing of the two
species at x= 0. We regularize the model considered above via a lattice discretization, to
cure properly the UV divergences of the entanglement. For instance, we consider a chain of
Nconsecutive sites ( x= 1, . . . , N) with a lattice spacing ε= 1, playing the role of UV cutoff,
and we require

Inthisway, onecanshowthatEq.(3.1)admitsadiscretisationintermsofacomplexharmonic
chain with nearest neighbor interactions (see Refs. [62,91,92] for more details). By doing a
change of basis which diagonalises S(which has eigenvalues ±1), as in Eq. (2.6), we obtain
two species of (nonphysical) decoupled fields with either Neumann or Dirichlet boundary
conditions at the defect.
Thus, it is convenient to introduce two pair kernels, corresponding to these two choices of
boundary conditions at the edges of the chain, as

3.2 Spectral density
In order to evaluate the spectral density, we use a strategy similar to the one employed in
Sec. 2.2, using the exact relation between the correlation matrices with and without the
defects.
We first define the matrix
EA=XAPA−1/4, (3.11)
constructed in the absence of defect, and we use an additional apex when the defect is present,
similarly to Eq. (2.16). We repeat the same steps done in Sec. 2.2: we derive the result for
EA, then for E′
Aand by inverting the relation between E′
AandX′
AP′
A, we recover the desired
result. For n= 1, one can easily show that Eqs. (3.9), (3.8) can be rewritten as
Z1(α) =det−1 

,
Z′
1(α) =det−1 
1 + 4 sin2(α/2)(X′

.(3.12)
From the above equations, it is possible to write a relation between the resolvent of EA,
denoted by GEA, and the full counting statistics Z1(α)as
GEA(y) =−d
dylogZ1(α(y)), (3.13)
where y=−1/(4 sin2(α/2)). We notice that the relation above slightly differs from Eq. (2.23),
valid for fermions, due to the presence of a different multiplicative factor and a minus sign in
the definition of y. Inserting Eq. (3.10) in Eq. (3.13), one gets after straightforward algebra

As expected, the resolvent has a branch-cut for y∈(0,+∞), corresponding to the support of
the spectrum of EA, and it is smooth elsewhere. In particular, for those values of ywe get

A, given by Eq. (3.19)
for different values of the transmission probability T. The support of the density is z∈
(1/4,∞), while it vanishes elsewhere.
A remarkable relation, which follows directly from the definition (see also [62]), is
E′
A=TEA, (3.16)
which allows us to recover the spectral density with the defect via a simple rescaling, as
GE′
A(y) =GEA(y/T), ρ E′
A(y) =1

computation of the charged moments for any value of n(even non-integer), which read

a result which was already obtained with completely different methods in Ref. [62]. Indeed,
as we did in Eq. (2.37) for fermions, we can write the charged moments in the factorized form

have been obtained fixing α= 2and varying T. The solid lines correspond to Eq. (3.20),
where we have fitted the constant term. The analytical formula matches well the data as N
increases and for large values of αandT, but for values of the parameters much larger values

.(3.23)
We finally notice that the last expression, valid for any α, has a singularity at α= 0for any
value of T ∈(0,1], which comes from the term at p= 0.
In Fig. 4 we test the prediction for the full counting statistics given by Eq. (3.20). We find
that the agreement improves as the subsystem size Nincreases and for large values of αand
T. It was already proven in [85,93] that, without a defect, the lattice results for the charged
moments of the complex harmonic chains approach the theoretical ones in a nonuniform way.
Indeed, the subleading contributions in Las function of αare not known for bosonic theories
and this prevents us from finding always a good match with the numerics (see, e.g., the dashed
orange line in the left panel of Fig. 4). This scenario further worsens as Tapproaches zero
and the two chains become decoupled: in this case, the coefficient of the logarithmic term
goes to 0, but for small and finite values of Tthe corrections become of the same order as
the leading order term, therefore larger values of the system size are required to see a good
agreement (see the red line in the right panel of Fig. 4).
3.3 Symmetry resolved entropies
As an application of the results for the charged moments, we can find the symmetry resolved
Rényi entropies in the scaling limit L/ε≫1. To do so, we need to understand the behaviour
of the charged moments near α= 0. Here the situation is more subtle with respect to the
fermionic case, as a cusp singularity is present at α= 0, and one cannot apply the saddle
point approximation. Indeed, an expansion for small values of αis given by
−logZ′
n(α) = (An(T) +Bn(T)|α|+O(α2)) logL
ε+. . . , (3.24)
14with An(T), Bn(T)given by, respectively,
An(T) =Z∞
1/4dzρX′
AP′
A(z) log((√z−1/2)2n+ (√z+ 1/2)2n−2(z−1/4)n),(3.25)
(again for integer na simpler expression can be found expanding Eq. (3.21)) and
Bn(T) =√
T
2πn. (3.26)
Once we plug the result of Eq. (3.24) in the Fourier transform (2.39), we obtain
Zn(q) =Zn(0)Bn(T) logL/ε
π(q2+ (Bn(T) logL/ε)2), (3.27)
Sn(q) =Sn−log logL
ε+O(1). (3.28)
It is worth to mention that we obtain the equipartition of the entanglement at leading order,
with a double logarithmic correction with a prefactor 1rather than 1/2, as it happens for
the fermions in Eq. (2.44). On the other hand, the first term breaking the equipartition is
O(q2/(logL
ε)2), which differs from the O(q2/logN)found for fermions in Eq. (2.44) [85,94].
4 Conclusions
Inthiswork,wehaveinvestigatedthequantumfluctuationsofthe U(1)chargeforfreemassless
boson and fermions in the presence of an interface defect. In particular, we have considered a
family of conformal defects, parametrised by the transmission probability T, giving analytical
predictions for the full-counting statistics, the charged moments and the symmetry resolved
Rényi entropies. Our approach relies on finding the spectral densities of the correlation
matrix of the models restricted to the subsystem, by relating what happens when T<1
to the case T= 1, i.e. in the absence of the defect. This technique is complementary to
the standard replica trick [63] and its main advantage is that it provides automatically an
analytical continuation for any non-integer Rényi index n. We also emphasize that, while
some universal features depend explicitly on T, as the logarithmic prefactor of logZ′
n(α),
the leading terms of the symmetry resolved entropies depends on Tonly through the total
entropy (except for the trivial case T= 0where the wires are decoupled).

Inparticular, asshowninRefs.[61,62]usingconformalfieldtheorytools, itispossibletorelate
directly any non-trivial bipartition of wires to the simpler case of two wires. Moreover, still
from the results of Refs. [61,62], one can also derive the symmetry resolved negativity [95,96]
between two wires in a three-wire geometry.
An interesting problem that we leave for future investigation is the possible relation be-
tween the spectral properties of the reduced correlation matrix (studied in this paper) and
the ones of the reduced density matrix ρA, an important quantity known as entanglement
spectrum [97]. A close direction is the characterisation of the modular flow in the presence of
a defect, which has been partially addressed in [98].

15A Finite-dimensional representation of the correlation function
In this appendix, we explain how to represent the correlation function in (2.8) as a finite
dimensional matrix. The method has been considered in Ref. [61], and we report here the
details of the derivation.
From now on, we set the spatial size to be L= 1. Thus, the kernel C′
ij(x, y)can be regarded
as an operator acting on the Hilbert space C2⊗L2([0,1]). In particular, the factor L2([0,1])
represents the wave-functions on [0,1], while C2labels the space of the two wires. The first
issue is that the Hilbert space L2([0,1])is infinite dimensional, and the operator C′
ij(x, y)has
an infinite number of eigenvalues. However, both CNDandCDDappearing in Eq. (2.8) act
non-trivially only on a finite-dimension subspace H0(their image is finite dimensional). The
latter property is important, since only the non-zero eigenvalues of the kernel C′enter the
evaluation of the entanglement measures we are interested in.
In particular, we choose H0⊂L2([0,1])to be generated by the independent wavefunctions
en≡(
ϕDD(n, x),1≤n≤N
ϕND(n−N, x),1 +N≤n≤2N,(A.1)
that we pick as a (non-orthonormal) basis. It is easy to show that, since the single-particle
eigenfunctions are normalised in both ND and DD sectors, one has
⟨en, en′⟩=Z
dxϕDD(n, x)ϕDD(n′, x) =δn,n′, n, n′= 1, . . . , N, (A.2)
and similarly if n, n′= 1 + N, . . . , 2N. However, for n≤Nandn′≥N+ 1, their scalar
product Qn,n′is non-vanishing, and it is

We now aim to give a matrix representation of the kernels CND, CDDin the subspace H0,
and one needs to be careful since the basis in not orthonormal. To overcome this issue, we
introduce the dual space H∗
0, namely the space of linear functional on H0, and the dual basis
associated to {en}
{e∗
n}n=1,...,2N, (A.4)
that is
e∗
n(en′) =δnn′, (A.5)
by definition. To avoid confusion, we use another symbol for the bra associated to en, denoted
by
e†
n∈ H∗
0, (A.6)
and satisfying
e†
n(v)≡ ⟨en, v⟩,∀v∈ H 0. (A.7)
Both e†
nande∗
nbelong to H0, but they are different since
e†
n(en′) =Qn,n′, e∗
n(en′) =δnn′, n≤N, n′≥N+ 1, (A.8)
which is a consequence of the non-orthonormality of the basis.
We now express the projectors CNDandCDD, seen as operators of H0and belonging to
End(H0)≃ H 0⊗ H∗

16in terms of the basis as
CDD=NX
n=1en⊗e†

A.1 Proof of Eq. (2.19)
In this Appendix we prove Eq. (2.19) following Ref. [61]. As a first step, we introduce an
auxiliary quantity for the computation of the entanglement entropy, the covariance matrix
Γ′= 1−2C′of dimension 4N×4N. We restrict Γ′to the subsystem Amade of one wire, and
we get the 2N×2Nmatrix Γ′
A= 1−2C′
A. Employing the finite-dimensional representation
of the correlation matrix C′
Ain Eq. (2.12) toghether with (A.12), and making use of the
property (CDD)2=CDD,(CND)2=CND(CDDandCNDare projectors), we have
1−Γ′
A2= 4E′
A=T(CND−CDD)2, (A.15)
where E′

completely transmitting S-matrix obtained with T= 1

, (A.16)
we get
4EA= (CND−CDD)2. (A.17)
Thus, for a permeable defect with T<1, one finds that the matrix E′
Ais related to the one
appearing in Eq. (A.17) via the rescaling factor T, as shown by Eq. (A.15), that is the result
in Eq. (2.19) of the main text.
