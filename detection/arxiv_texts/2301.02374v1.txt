ABSTRACT
We present a novel, model-independent framework for studying the architecture of an exoplanetary system at the system level. This
framework allows us to characterise, quantify, and classify the architecture of an individual planetary system. Our aim in this en-
deavour is to generate a uniform systematic method to study the arrangement and distribution of various planetary quantities within a
single planetary system. We propose that the space of planetary system architectures be partitioned into four classes: similar, mixed,
anti-ordered, and ordered. A central aim of this paper is to introduce these four architecture classes. We applied our framework to
observed and synthetic multi-planetary systems, thereby studying their architectures of mass, radius, density, core mass, and the core
water mass fraction. We explored the relationships between a system‚Äôs (mass) architecture and other properties. Our work suggests
that: (a) similar architectures are the most common outcome of planet formation; (b) internal structure and composition of planets
shows a strong link with their system architecture; (c) most systems inherit their mass architecture from their core mass architecture;
(d) most planets that started inside the ice line and formed in-situ are found in systems with a similar architecture; and (e) most
anti-ordered systems are expected to be rich in wet planets, while most observed mass ordered systems are expected to have many dry
planets. We Ô¨Ånd, in good agreement with theory, that observations are generally biased towards the discovery of systems whose den-
sity architectures are similar, mixed, or anti-ordered. This study probes novel questions and new parameter spaces for understanding
theory and observations. Future studies may utilise our framework to not only constrain the knowledge of individual planets, but also
the multi-faceted architecture of an entire planetary system. We also speculate on the role of system architectures in hosting habitable
worlds.

1. Introduction
Over the last 25 years, our knowledge of exoplanetary astro-
physics has improved dramatically. While the Ô¨Årst decade was
marked by sensational discoveries of individual exoplanets (e.g.
Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003; Santos et al. 2004; Bouchy et al. 2005;
Udry et al. 2007; Kalas et al. 2008; Charbonneau et al. 2009;
Snellen et al. 2010), we are now in an age of population-level ex-
oplanetary statistics (for a recent review, see Zhu & Dong 2021).
We now know that (statistically) almost every star hosts a planet
and one in two Solar-like stars host a rocky planet in their habit-
able zone (Hsu et al. 2019; Bryson et al. 2021). Moreover, many
exoplanet-hosting stars have multiple planets orbiting them.
The arrangement of multiple planets and the collective dis-
tribution of their physical properties around host star(s) char-
acterises the architecture of a planetary system (Mishra et al.
2021). Exoplanets in some multi-planetary systems are thought
to behave like ‚Äòpeas in a pod‚Äô (Lissauer et al. 2011; Ciardi et al.
2013; Millholland et al. 2017; Weiss et al. 2018). The peas in a
pod trend consists of the following correlations: size, whereby
adjacent exoplanets are either similar or ordered in size (i.e. the
outer planet is larger); mass, whereby adjacent exoplanets are ei-

able online at https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?
J/A+A/ .ther similar or ordered in mass; spacing, whereby for a system
with three or more planets, the spacing between an adjacent pair
of exoplanets is similar to the spacing between the next consec-
utive pair; packing, whereby smaller planets tend to be packed
together closely and larger planets are in wider orbital conÔ¨Ågu-
rations.
While the statistical method used by Weiss et al. (2018) has
been debated (Zhu 2020; Murchikova & Tremaine 2020; Weiss
& Petigura 2020), support for the astrophysical nature of the
peas in a pod correlations (as opposed to emerging from detec-
tion biases) has emerged from theoretical studies and numerical
simulations (Adams 2019; Adams et al. 2020; He et al. 2019;
He et al. 2021; Mulders et al. 2020). In particular, Mishra et al.
(2021) reproduced the observations from Weiss et al. (2018) us-
ing a model of planet formation and evolution (the Bern Model
Emsenhuber et al. (2021a,b)) and a model for the detection bi-
ases of a Kepler-like transit survey (using KOBE). We showed
that when nature‚Äôs underlying exoplanetary population (consist-
ing of detected and undetected exoplanets) resembles peas in a
pod, then a population of transiting exoplanets will have correla-
tions that are consistent with those found by Weiss et al. (2018).
In addition, Mishra et al. (2021) suggested that the four trends
are not independent of each other. The size correlations seem to
emerge from the mass correlations, while the mass and packing

trends could combine to give rise to the spacing trend. The peas
in a pod trends are amenable to a uniÔ¨Åcation.
Most of the current studies on this topic utilise statistical
correlation coe cients at the population level, that is, the cor-
relation is measured for adjacent planetary pairs from several
planetary systems. While useful in terms of testing the existence
(or otherwise) of architecture trends, these coe cients may have
limited utility for analysing the architecture of a single planetary
system. Being statistical in nature, a reliable estimate of these
coecients requires large datasets - which seems di cult for a
single system. Although there are some planetary system-level
studies (Kipping 2018; Alibert 2019; Mishra et al. 2019; Gilbert
& Fabrycky 2020; Bashi & Zucker 2021, discussed in Sect. 3.1),
the current literature lacks a prescription for uniformly assessing
the multi-faceted architectures of several quantities (e.g. mass
architecture, radius architecture, or eccentricity architecture) for
a single planetary system.
We seek a framework that allows us to characterise the ar-
chitecture of an individual planetary system. Our motivations
for developing such a framework arise from questions related
to: formation, such as the extent to which a system‚Äôs architec-
ture is shaped by initial conditions (i.e. the environment in and
around the star and protoplanetary disk formation regions) (Jin
& Li 2014; Safsten et al. 2020); evolution, the role of physical
processes such as orbital migration or giant impacts in shaping
the Ô¨Ånal architecture of planetary systems (Mulders et al. 2020);
identiÔ¨Åcation, which particular stars host planets that resemble
peas in a pod, and, in particular, whether the planets in systems
like TOI-178 (Leleu et al. 2021), Trappist-1 (Agol et al. 2021),
or 55 Cancri (Bourrier et al. 2018) show mass /size similarities;
other architectures, we know that there are many planetary sys-
tems that do not follow the peas in a pod architecture (e.g. the
Solar System). Overall, it is not obvious how the architecture of
any individual planetary system should be uniformly assessed.
In this series of papers, we propose a framework for examin-
ing the architecture of planetary systems at the system level. The
philosophy behind system level analysis is to consider the en-
tire planetary system as a single unit of a physical system. This
framework allows us to not only quantify, compare, and inves-
tigate a system‚Äôs architecture, but also o ers some unexpected
beneÔ¨Åts. As it turns out, the framework allows for a conceptu-
ally intuitive partitioning of the space of possible architectures.
We label the four classes of planetary system architectures as:
similar, ordered, anti-ordered, and mixed. In this way, our work
extends the trends initiated by the notion of peas in a pod ar-
chitecture. Furthermore, we verify the uniÔ¨Åcation of the peas
in a pod correlations proposed in Mishra et al. (2021). We Ô¨Ånd
that, Similar architectures are the most common type of plane-
tary system architectures and their high occurrence explains why
the intra-system radius uniformity was already observable from
the Ô¨Årst four months of Kepler data (Lissauer et al. 2011).
Our framework engenders novel questions. For instance,
if nature produces distinct classes of architecture in multi-
planetary systems, then what is the frequency or occurrence rates
of these architecture classes? How does the occurrence of an ar-
chitecture class depend on stellar and protoplanetary disk en-
vironment? How does the architecture of a system evolve over
time? What is the role of stellar evolution, protoplanetary disk
interactions, and planet formation in shaping the Ô¨Ånal architec-
ture? How is a planet‚Äôs internal composition related to the sys-
tem‚Äôs architecture? Or does the ability of a planet to host life
depends on the architecture of the planetary system? In this se-
ries of papers, we explore these questions. Although the num-
ber of multi-planetary systems is low today, this may changein the next few decades. Thanks to large survey missions such
as PLATO (Rauer et al. 2014), GAIA (Gaia Collaboration et al.
2016), TESS (Ricker et al. 2015), LIFE (Quanz et al. 2022), and
others, the growing number of known multi-planetary systems
will allow for a better understanding to emerge. We hope our
work encourages observers to dedicate more observation time
to detecting planets within a known planetary system, that is, in
Ô¨Ånding multi-planetary systems.
The architecture classiÔ¨Åcation scheme proposed in this pa-
per is a model-independent framework. To demonstrate our clas-
siÔ¨Åcation framework and explore its consequences, we applied
our framework to simulated planetary systems. To illustrate our
framework on real systems, we also applied our framework to
observed exoplanetary systems. We emphasise that while the re-
sults emerging from the application of our framework on these
datasets may su er from some limitations (arising from theoret-
ical modelling or detection biases for observed systems); how-
ever, the concept of our architecture classiÔ¨Åcation scheme, being
model-independent, does not share these limitations. In this pa-
per, we present the catalogues of planetary systems we apply our
framework to in Sect. 2, along with a newly curated catalogue of
observed exoplanetary systems and simulated planetary systems,
using the Bern Model. We introduce our framework in Sect. 3.
In Sect. 4, the characteristics of the architecture classes are dis-
cussed. We explore the link between the internal composition
of planets and the system architecture class in Sect. 5. Then, in
Sect. 6, we speculate on how habitability could depend on the
architecture of planetary systems. Our conclusions are given in
Sect. 7.
In a companion paper, we investigate the formation path-
ways, i.e. the role of initial conditions and physical processes
in shaping the Ô¨Ånal architecture (Mishra et al. (2023) referred to
as Paper II). Our work demonstrates that the processes of planet
formation and evolution are imprinted on the entire system-level
architecture. We Ô¨Ånd that protoplanetary disks with low solid-
mass give rise to planetary systems endowed with a mass similar-
ity. On the other hand, massive disks and high metallicity often
lead to mass Ordered, Anti-Ordered, or Mixed system architec-
tures. Planet-planet and planet-disk interactions play a decisive
role in shaping these three architectures.
2. Catalogues
2.1. Theoretical dataset: Bern Model
In this series of works, we demonstrate our architecture frame-
work by analysing the architecture of synthetic planetary sys-
tems. These systems were numerically computed using the Gen-
eration III Bern Model of planet formation and evolution (Em-
senhuber et al. 2021a,b) that is based on the core-accretion
paradigm of planet formation (Pollack et al. 1996; Alibert et al.
2004, 2005). The model follows the growth of protoplanetary
embryos embedded in a protoplanetary disk of gas and solids
around a solar-type star. A diverse range of physical processes
are simultaneously occurring and coherently computed in this
1D star-disk-embryo system. These include: stellar and disk
physics (evolution of and interaction between star and viscous
disk, condensation of volatile and refractory species, etc.), plane-
tary formation physics (accretion of planetesimals and gases, in-
ternal structure calculations, etc.), and additional physics (orbital
and tidal migration, planet-planet N-body interactions, planet-
disk interactions, atmospheric escape, deuterium fusion, etc.).
We describe these physical processes in Sect. A and a descriptive
summary of these processes is provided in Mishra et al. (2021,

in particular, Fig. 1 and Sections 2, 3, and Appendix A). More
details can also be found in (Emsenhuber et al. 2021a,b).
We synthesised 1000 planetary systems, each starting with
100 lunar mass protoplanetary embryos, wherein the following
initial conditions were varied: mass of protoplanetary gas disk,
photo-evaporation rate, dust-to-gas ratio, disk inner edge, and
the starting location of embryos. In Fig. 1, we show all synthetic
planets on the mass-distance diagram. For each synthetic plane-
tary system failed embryos, objects with mass less than 0 :1M,
were removed from further analysis1.
Three observationally motivated catalogues were prepared
from the synthetic dataset. This allowed us to facilitate a compar-
ison of the architecture from observed planetary systems with the
synthetic planetary systems and to make predictions. The param-
eter space spanned by the planets in these catalogues is shown in
Fig. 1. These catalogues are as follows:
Bern RV Multis : We assume a radial velocity (RV) survey
which can Ô¨Ånd planets with periods 15 yr and semi-amplitude
KRV20 cm=s. These numbers are motivated by (a) long-
running RV surveys such as the HARPS survey (Mayor et al.
2003, 2011) and the California Legacy Survey (Rosenthal et al.
2021b; Fulton et al. 2021); (b) current precision achieved by
ESPRESSO (Lillo-Box et al. 2021; Netto et al. 2021); and (c)
making predictions for future RV surveys. Such RV detectable
synthetic planetary systems with four or more planets form the

and (c) are currently unobservable in exoplanetary systems. All results
arising from the Bern RV Multis, Bern KOBE Multis, and Bern Com-
pact Multis are insensitive to these failed embryos.Bern RV Multis catalogue, which includes 3 828 planets around
565 stars.
Bern KOBE Multis : We assume a Kepler-like transit survey
which continuously observes 2 105stars for 3:5 yr (Thompson
et al. 2018). A planet which transits three or more times and pro-
duces a transit S /N of 7.1 or more is considered detectable. The
reliability and completeness of such a survey is replicated and
those synthetic planets which would have been vetted as ‚Äòplan-
etary candidates‚Äô by the Kepler Robovetter (Thompson et al.
2018), are kept. Such transiting synthetic planetary systems with
four or more planets form the Bern KOBE Multis catalogue.
KOBE was developed and introduced in Mishra et al. (2021).
There are 6 715 planets around 1283 stars in this catalogue.
Bern Compact Multis: Ongoing transit missions such as
CHEOPS and TESS have been successful in characterising com-
pact multi-planetary systems, such as TOI-178 (Leleu et al.
2021) and TOI-561 (Lacedelli et al. 2021). Inspired by these dis-
coveries, we investigated the architecture of compact planetary
systems simulated by the Bern Model. Our aim is to understand
the architecture and make predictions for such systems based on
the core-accretion paradigm (Pollack et al. 1996; Alibert et al.
2004, 2005). All planets with periods of 100 d and masses of
0:1Mwere retained. Synthetic planetary systems, in this pa-
rameter space, with four or more planets form the Bern Compact
Multis catalogue, with 2 412 planets around 400 stars included.
2.2. Observational dataset: A new catalogue
To demonstrate our framework on observed exoplanetary sys-
tems, we have curated a new catalogue of known multi-planetary
systems2. A salient feature of this catalogue (and the philosophy
behind this work) is its focus on considering planetary systems
as a single unit of a physical system. Unlike focussing on in-
dividual exoplanets or a single detection technique, our aim is
to study the planetary system as a whole. There are two serious
challenges to this endeavour. Firstly, the biases present in de-
tection methods tend to prevent a complete, reliable picture of
an exoplanetary system from emerging (either via undetected or
mischaracterised planets). Secondly, detecting planets on long
orbital periods requires long-term, repeated observations, which
is considerably challenging. We hope that upcoming missions
and future surveys can mitigate these di culties.
We included a planetary system in our catalogue if: (a) it has
at least four known planets and (b) masses are available for at
least four planets. For example, Kepler-33, a Ô¨Åve planet system,
is included because mass measurements are available for four
of its planets3. The criterion of requiring minimum four plan-
ets emerges due to (a) the requirement for enough planets for
adequately characterising the architecture and (b) because for
systems with lower number of planets, it is perhaps di cult to
uniformly assess whether the low multiplicity is an outcome of
natural processes or detection biases. To keep the comparison be-
tween observations and theory uniform, all catalogues in this se-
ries of works only consider planetary systems with four or more
planets. The architecture framework can, however, handle two-
or three-planet systems as well. To make this catalogue useful
to the wider community and enable future studies, we gathered
several key stellar and exoplanetary properties. For host stars, we
report the mass, radius, luminosity, e ective temperature, metal-
licity, age, and distance, along with their identiÔ¨Åcation numbers
2The catalogue was last updated in April 2021.
3For this study, the distinction between mass and minimum mass is
ignored.

(when available) in the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC), TESS In-
put Catalogue (TIC), and GAIA ID. For planets, we report mass
or minimum mass, radius, semi-major axis, eccentricity, and in-
clination. In a conservative approach, errors (reported when pos-
sible) are the maximum of the upper and lower error bounds
available in the literature. When multiple publications reported
planetary parameters, a more recent publication was preferred.
When a single publication reported parameters for all planets in
a system, then such a consistent set of solution was given pref-
erence (e.g. GJ 676 A or Kepler-11). For stellar parameters, if
a star was included in KIC, then the values from Berger et al.
(2020) are reported. Most other stellar parameters come from
the TIC (Stassun et al. 2019) or from individual publications.
There are 41 planetary systems that meet our criteria and de-
Ô¨Åne our multi-planetary system catalogue (Table 1). With a total
of 194 planets in our catalogue, the number of planetary systems
with four, Ô¨Åve, six, seven, and eight planets is 24, 7, 8, 1, and 1.
In this paper, we present the observed planetary systems as they
are known today and we do not correct the observations for any
detection biases. Instead, to assist in making comparisons with
the theory, detection biases will be placed on simulated plane-
tary systems (Sect. 2.1). Figure 1 shows the mass of observed
exoplanets as a function of their semi-major axis.
While our observed multi-planetary systems catalogue en-
genders system-level studies, its current form poses several tech-
nical di culties. Foremost, the number of observations is only
forty-one. Secondly, multiple detection methods, such as radial
velocity or transits (etc.) were employed to observe these plan-
etary systems. Each observation technique su ers from certain
limitations and detection biases. This implies that the observed
systems in our catalogue do not constitute a homogeneous and
complete set of observations. These two limitations of the ob-
servations catalogue prohibit us from deducing any statistically
strong result. Nevertheless, we used the observed systems for
(a) exemplifying system-level approach to real planetary systems
and (b) using our framework on observations to explore trends
in the architecture of observed systems.Our results from the observed catalogue may be a ected by
another source of di culty. There are two systems in our cata-
logue that host some planets without known mass measurements
(Kepler-33 b and Kepler-80 f and g). Since these two systems
have at least four planets with known masses, they have been
included in our study. However, this does not impact the results
of the present study in a drastic way. All three planets in these
systems without mass measurements are either the innermost
and/or the outermost planets in their respective systems. There-
fore, the missing measurements do not have a strong inÔ¨Çuence
on the characterisable mass architecture. The missing measure-
ment may have a strong e ect if any planet with unknown mass
was in between two planets with known masses.
3. Characterizing architecture: A new framework
3.1. Literature review
We review some approaches from other studies that have tried to
capture planetary system-level properties in this section. Kipping
(2018) investigated similarity and ordering (of planetary sizes) at
the level of an individual system. Using an entropy based frame-
work on Kepler systems, he concludes that initial conditions
are inferable from the present-day architecture. As we go on to
show in this series, our work not only supports this conclusion,
but additionally demonstrates the possible links between initial
conditions and Ô¨Ånal architecture. Although the above-mentioned
study considers a similar problem to the one we deal with here,
our frameworks di er considerably. Built on step-functions and
combinatorics, the aforementioned framework does not take into
account the magnitude of variation.
Alibert (2019) proposed a concept of distance between two
planetary systems. The Alibert distance captures inter-system
dierences, whereas our framework quantiÔ¨Åes intra-system sim-
ilarities. The Alibert distance is useful to quantify the similarity
(or dissimilarity) between two planetary systems and in unsuper-
vised machine-learning algorithms to Ô¨Ånd clusters in the space
of planetary systems. Bashi & Zucker (2021) recently proposed
Article number, page 4 of 28L. Mishra et al.: Architecture Framework I ‚Äì Four classes of planetary system architecture
another concept for distance based on a statistical distance. The
‚Äòweighted‚Äô energy distance is the distance between two plane-
tary systems, with each planet represented on the log-period and
log-radius plane, utilising planetary masses (from a mass-radius
relationship) as weights. As with the Alibert distance, the Bashi-
Zucker distance requires two planetary systems and thus it is
not suitable for characterising the global architecture for a single
planetary system.
Gilbert & Fabrycky (2020) proposed seven parameters for
quantifying the global structure of planetary systems: dynam-
ical mass (ratio of mass in planets to stellar mass), mass par-
titioning (normalised mass disequilibrium), mass monotonicity
(weighted Spearman correlation coe cient), characteristic spac-
ing (average mutual Hill radii), gap complexity, Ô¨Çatness, and
multiplicity ( n). Of these measurements, mass partitioning and
mass monotonicity have close parallels with our framework. The
input information required to compute mass partitioning, and
monotonicity is exactly the same as the input information for
our architecture framework, namely, a set of planetary masses.
However, we Ô¨Ånd that the output displays a curious mix of con-
cepts.
Mass partitioning is zero for a system in which all planets
have the same mass. When one planet has some mass and all
other planets have negligible mass, the mass partitioning for this
system is unity. While this parameter captures the two extreme
cases, it is di cult to interpret and employ this measure in cases
other than these two extremes. Behaving similarly to a correla-
tion coe cient, mass monotonicity has a range of [-1,1]. It is de-
Ô¨Åned as the Spearman correlation coe cient (between mass and
distance) multiplied by the mass partitioning (which is weighted
byn 1). Although the work of Gilbert & Fabrycky (2020) stud-
ies the architecture of planetary systems at the system-level, we
seek a framework which can also be used with planetary prop-
erties other than mass, such as radius, bulk density, water mass
fraction, eccentricities, and so on.
Millholland et al. (2017) and Wang (2017) showed that the
peas in a pod pattern reported by Ciardi et al. (2013); Weiss
et al. (2018) also extends to planetary masses. Millholland et al.
(2017), using planetary masses derived from transit-timing vari-
ations, studied the clustering of planets in the mass-radius plane
and found that the sum of distances (in the log mass-size space)
between adjacent planets of real systems is much smaller than
a bootstrapped randomised population. Based on a set of 29 RV
observed systems, Wang (2017) infer two types of planetary sys-
tems. Planetary systems with masses of .30Mshow intra-
system mass uniformity, while systems with masses &100M
do not follow the peas in a pod pattern ‚Äì indicating that there are
only two possibilities for the architecture structure. As we show
in this series of works, their hypothesis of only two architecture
types is too simple and cannot capture the richness of physics.
3.2. Concept
With our framework, we initially aimed to capture the key aspect
about the peas in a pod architecture trends. These trends are cor-
relations between adjacent planets or between consecutive pairs
of adjacent planets. We want to capture these ideas at the level
of a single planetary system through a uniÔ¨Åed framework. We
do this by studying how a quantity, qi, (such as mass, size, or
period ratio) varies for all planets within a system. Here, iin-
dexes the planets within a system. For all quantities, we adopt
an ‚Äòinside-out‚Äô convention, namely, we start with the innermost
planet ( qi=1) and go to the next adjacent planet ( qi=2), and so
on. By comparing how qivaries for each planet inside-out, we

ing on how a quantity (e.g. mass or size) varies from one planet to an-
other, the architecture of a system can be identiÔ¨Åed.
are actually estimating how qivaries with distance from the host
star.
In comparing a quantity, qi, with distance, four kind of vari-
ations emerge. In one scenario, a quantity could show little to no
variation. In another case, the value of a quantity may increase
with increasing distance or, conversely, the quantity could de-
crease from one planet to another. Finally, it is also possible for
a quantity to not have any clear variations from one planet to
another. We identify these four scenarios as the four classes of
architectures that can exist at the level of a single planetary sys-
tem. This idea is depicted in Fig. 2.
Mishra et al. (2021) suggested that the mass correlations
could originate from planet-formation physics and the correla-
tions of size and spacing could be derivative. Therefore, we Ô¨Årst
apply our framework using planetary masses (except in Sects.
5 and 6). As depicted in Fig. 2, when the masses of all planets
within a system are similar to each other, we label the architec-
ture of such systems as ‚Äòsimilar‚Äô. This architecture class corre-
sponds to the peas in a pod architecture reported in observations
(Weiss et al. 2018; Millholland et al. 2017). When the masses of
planets tend to increase inside-out, the architecture of such sys-
tems is labelled ‚Äòordered‚Äô. If the planetary mass tends to decrease
from the inner planet to the outer, we label the architecture of
these systems as ‚Äòanti-ordered‚Äô. Finally, if a large increasing and
decreasing variation in the planetary masses is present, we label
the architecture of such systems as ‚Äòmixed‚Äô. The mixed architec-
ture class is also useful in capturing all other architecture pat-
terns which do not fall under the other three architecture classes.
Kipping (2018), for example, has analysed some interesting re-
peating patterns. By introducing these architecture classes, our
framework organises the possibilities for system architecture.

One might wonder, at this point, why introduce such a con-
cept and the ensuing mathematical machinery? While part of this
work began as an inspired exploration to categorise our under-
standing of system architecture, it turns out that there are good
physical reasons to pursue this process. As is shown in this and
a companion paper, planetary systems that have the same archi-
tecture tend to have a host of other properties in common, such
as internal structures (core-mass, ice-mass) distributions. Most
importantly, systems with a common architecture tend to have
same formation pathways, initial conditions, and evolutionary
histories. Practically, this means that a quick glance at a system‚Äôs
architecture may reveal a lot more about its formation scenario.
Our architecture classiÔ¨Åcation framework utilises two quan-
tities ‚Äì the coe cient of similarity and the coe cient of vari-
ation, introduced in Sects. 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. These two
coecients allow us to quantify the conceptual ideas we have
presented above. Together, these coe cients deÔ¨Åne a new space
of possibilities for system architectures. In Sect. 3.5, we iden-
tify the regions of this architecture space that correspond to the
four architecture classes introduced above. As this framework
deals with the architecture of multi-planetary system, systems
with only one planet are not studied within this framework.
3.3. CoefÔ¨Åcient of similarity
The term ‚Äòcoe cient of similarity‚Äô is commonly used in the
Ô¨Åelds studying statistics of ecology and genetics (Gower 1971;
Dalirsefat et al. 2009). We borrow the term but develop our
own concept and deÔ¨Ånition.Let qbe a planetary quantity such
as mass, size, period ratios of adjacent planets, bulk density, ec-
centricity, and so on4. The value of this quantity for the ithplanet
in a system is denoted by qi. The coe cient of similarity, CS,
measures how qchanges from one planet to another, inside-out.
For a system with nplanets, it is deÔ¨Åned as:
CS(q)=1
n 1i=n 1X
i=1 
logqi+1
qi!
: (1)
There is a clear physical interpretation for CS(q): the coe cient
of similarity measures the average order of magnitude variation
in the quantity qfrom one planet to another. The deÔ¨Ånition of
the coe cient of similarity allows us to map the architecture of
a planetary system on a one dimensional axis. When CS(q)
0, then the system‚Äôs architecture could imply a similarity in q.
When CS(q) is positive, then planets within a system are ordered
inq. Conversely, CS(q) being negative, implies that the planets
are anti-ordered.
We have developed a mathematical formalism to study the
sensitivity of the coe cient of similarity. In Appendix C, we de-
rive the limiting values of the coe cient of similarity and present
the results here. For example, when the qivalues for all planets
in a system are within 10% of each other, then the maximum
possible value of CS(q) is 0:09 (see Eq. C.10). For maximum
tolerances of 20% ;40%;60%;and 80%, the maximum possi-
ble value of CS(q) are 0:18;0:37;0:60;and 0:95 respectively.
In Fig. C.1, we show the dependence of the max CS(q) ont.
The coe cient of similarity cannot distinguish between two
classes of architecture: similar and mixed. Systems which show
similarity will have CS(q)0. However, system with mixed ar-
chitecture have large increasing and decreasing variations, such
4For quantities which admit zero as a possible value, the coe cient of
similarity may become ill-deÔ¨Åned. This is a coordinate singularity and
can be dealt with an appropriate treatment (see Eq. 4 Sect. 5.4).that the log of ratiosqi+1
qicancels itself out. Such systems will also
have CS(q)0. We propose the coe cient of variation to distin-
guish these two architecture classes. The coe cient of similarity
depends on the actual order in which planets exist (inside-out) in
a system. As we go on to show, the coe cient of variation does
not depend on the ordering of planets in a system.
3.4. CoefÔ¨Åcient of variation
The coe cient of variation, CV, is a standard descriptive statistic
used to measure the magnitude of variation in a set of numbers
(Katsnelson & Kotz 1957; Sharma et al. 2010; Abdi 2010). It is
deÔ¨Åned as the ratio of the standard deviation with the mean:
CV(q)=(q)
¬Øq: (2)
The coe cient of variation is a positive quantity. When all
qihave the same value then CV(q)=0. Planetary systems con-
sisting of planets that have a small (or large) variability in their
qivalues will have a small (or large) value of the coe cient of
variation. Now, the distinction between systems showing simi-
larity and mixed architecture is clear. While similar systems will
have a low value of the coe cient of variation, mixed systems
will have a high value of coe cient of variation.
Since this coe cient is a well known statistical measure,
there are some derivations for its limit. A classical result from
Katsnelson & Kotz (1957) shows that, for a set of nnumbers,
the maximum value of the coe cient of variation isp
n 1.
However, this result is only a particular case in our setup. In Ap-
pendix C, we develop a mathematical formalism to understand
the limits of the coe cient of variation and present the results
here. When the qivalues for all planets in a system are within
10%;30%;50%;70%;and 90% of each other, the absolute the-
oretical upper limit of CV(q) is 0:10;0:31;0:58;0:98;and 2:06
respectively. Figure C.1 shows how this upper limit varies with
the maximum tolerance, t, for a system.
3.5. Classifying the architectures of planetary systems
We are interested in obtaining a mapping from the scale-
invariant coe cients to an architecture class. In Appendix D,
we present some considerations that motivate the selection of
boundaries between the four classes. The selected boundaries
were additionally tested on thousands of mock planetary systems
to check their ability to correctly classify the four architecture
classes. We propose the following boundaries for identifying the
architecture class based on planetary masses.
Architecture class Condition
Anti-ordered CS(M)< 0:2
Ordered CS(M)>+0:2
Similar jCS(M)j0:2 and CV(M)p
n 1
2
Mixed jCS(M)j0:2 and CV(M)>p
n 1
2(3)
A natural (and welcome) outcome of these criteria is that a
two-planet system can never have a mixed class architecture. The
boundary between similar and mixed class is half the maximum
possible value of the coe cient of variation. For the solar sys-
tem, CS(M)=0:36 and CV(M)=1:85. This framework robustly

coecient of variation (mass). The shaded regions show the allowed parameter space for planetary systems. The white gaps (between two shaded
regions) mark the mathematically forbidden regions of this architecture space. Di erent parts of this parameter space are identiÔ¨Åed with four
architecture classes, in accordance with Eq. 3. Each point corresponds to an individual planetary system. For visual clarity, the shaded and
unshaded regions are drawn only for systems hosting up to Ô¨Åfteen planets. Left: Planetary systems from the Bern model and observations. Right:

identiÔ¨Åes the architecture of the solar system as ordered5. This
classiÔ¨Åcation is in line with the historic understanding of the so-
lar system architecture: small rocky planets on the inside and
giant planets on the outside. If, however, Neptune were replaced
with an Earth-like planet, the architecture of the solar system
would be classiÔ¨Åed as mixed. Considering only the inner four
planets of the solar system, CS(M)=0:10 and CV(M)=0:85,
would make the architecture of the inner solar system belong to
the similar class. The architecture of the outer four giants in the
solar system is anti-ordered and we have CS(M)= 0:42 and
CV(M)=1:11.
Figure 3 shows the CS(M) versus CV(M) space for plane-
tary systems from several catalogues. The Bern model planetary
systems occupy all four regions of this architecture space. Ob-
served planetary systems, however, span only a limited region
of this parameter space, given the low multiplicity of observed
planetary systems. The architecture space spanned by the ob-
served planetary systems (shaded contour) is in agreement with
the synthetically observed planetary systems from Bern Com-
pact Multis, Bern KOBE Multis, and Bern RV Multis.
The architecture for the systems in the synthetically observed
catalogue was calculated based only on the planets that were de-
tected (for RV /KOBE) or included (for Bern Compact Multis) in
the above-mentioned catalogue. It is theoretically possible for a
single Bern model system to exhibit di erent architectures de-
pending on the planets which are detected or included. The re-
verse is also true ‚Äì the architecture of an observed planetary sys-
tem may change if new planets are discovered or old controver-
sial candidates are rejected. While the ground truth architecture
for observations seems elusive, a comparison with synthetic ob-
5Even if the masses of each solar system planet were randomly varied
within 85% of their original values, the emerging architecture is still
ordered. With 1M trials, varying the masses randomly within 90% of
their original values lead to ordered (for 99:45% trials), mixed (for
0:55% trials), and similar (for 0:001% trials) architectures.servations can bring forth patterns which are unexpected. With
this in mind, we consider the following example.
Detection biases, in both radial velocities and transits, gen-
erally disfavour the discovery of less-massive and small planets
at larger distances. This implies that anti-ordered architectures
are di cult to detect. In fact, we have no known example of a
planetary system showing anti-ordered architecture in our obser-
vations catalogue. This is surprising for two major reasons: (a)
theory suggests their existence: there are several synthetic plan-
etary systems from the Bern Model whose architecture is anti-
ordered; (b) theory suggests their discovery: all three syntheti-
cally observed catalogues contain some (albeit few) anti-ordered
planetary systems. Since the number of systems in our catalogue
is too low, we refrain from making any conclusions and, instead,
we await the discovery of anti-ordered architectures in the future.
However, if such architectures are not found despite considerable
eorts, this result will become a strong indicator for shaping our
understanding of planet formation.
Another aspect of this new architecture space is the underly-
ing mathematical structure6. In Fig. 3, the shaded areas shown
regions where a planetary system, with n2[2;15] planets, is al-
lowed. A system with two planets, for example, can only occupy
the shaded region labelled ‚Äò n=2‚Äô. All non-shaded regions (in
white ‚Äì except the shaded regions for 16 or more planets which is
not drawn), on this architecture space, is mathematically forbid-
den. These are parts of the architecture parameter space that no
planetary system, irrespective of its conÔ¨Åguration, can occupy.
6Visualizing this structure is easy (not shown). (a) Construct mock
planetary systems with masses, for each mock planet, randomly drawn
from a uniform distribution with suitable limits. (b) It is suggested to
vary the number of planets in these mock systems randomly. (c) Calcu-
late the CS(M) and the CV(M) using equations 1 and 2. (d) Plot CS(M)
versus CV(M) for this mock population. For large number of systems
the plot should be symmetric about CS(M)=0.
Article number, page 7 of 28A&A proofs: manuscript no. 43751corr
This strong result stems from the mathematical limits that were
derived for this work (see Sects. 3.3, 3.4, and appendix C).
For clarity and future convenience, we introduced some ter-
minology to the method. When the architecture framework (i.e.
CSandCV) is applied on planetary bulk masses, the resulting in-
formation tells us the mass architecture of a system, namely, the
arrangement and distribution of masses in said system. Similarly,
when this framework is applied on radii, it gives us the radius ar-
chitecture (arrangement and distribution of radii) for the system
(Sect. 5.1). Similarly, we can obtain the bulk-density architecture
(Sect. 5.2), core-mass architecture (Sect. 5.3), water mass frac-
tion architecture (Sect. 5.4), period-ratio or spacing architecture,
eccentricity-architecture, and so on. In this series of papers, we
identify a system‚Äôs architecture based on its bulk mass ar-
chitecture. Thus, when a system is said to be similar, we are
referring to the similarity in terms of the mass architecture.
4. Characteristics of architecture classes
4.1. General comments
In earlier studies on the peas in a pod architecture, the strength of
population-level (i.e. across many planetary systems) trends was
quantiÔ¨Åed using Pearson correlations coe cient (Weiss et al.
2018; Zhu 2020; Chevance et al. 2021; Millholland & Winn
2021; Mishra et al. 2021). The correlation coe cients were cal-
culated using planetary quantities in the log space (i.e. by Ô¨Årst
taking the log10of all quantities). This resulted in higher values
of the correlation coe cient since quantities have limited range
to perambulate in the log space. Consider planetary masses. We
calculated the correlation coe cient between the mass of adja-
cent inner and outer planets in the Bern model population (see
Fig. 7 in Mishra et al. 2021). The value of the coe cient is 0:66
in the log space and 0 :16 in the linear space. This highlights that
the planetary masses are more closely clustered in log than in
linear space.
We tested the same correlation for all systems in each ar-
chitecture class. We expect planetary masses in mixed, ordered,
and anti-ordered systems should (by deÔ¨Ånition) have low cor-
relations. On the other hand, similar class architecture should
exhibit a strong correlation. Surprisingly, in log space all archi-
tecture classes show strong correlations. The coe cient value
is 0:67 for similar class, 0 :69 for mixed class, 0 :50 for ordered
class, and 0 :58 for anti-ordered class architectures. However, in
the linear space the coe cient values reÔ¨Çects our expectation:
0:61 for the similar class, 0 :20 for the mixed class, 0 :16 for or-
dered class, and 0 :05 for anti-ordered class. This underscores
that strong correlations in the log space may not be indicative of
substantive architecture trends. It also shows that our framework
is capable of identifying systems in which the ‚Äôpeas in a pod‚Äô
architecture is discernible even in the linear space.
For all 41 observed planetary systems in our catalogue, we
report their architecture classes in Table 2. Figure 6 shows the
architecture of all observed multi-planetary systems in our cat-
alogue. The systems are sorted by their coe cient of similarity
values. The Ô¨Ågure also shows the four classes of architecture for
a few randomly selected synthetic planetary systems. To under-
stand the characteristics of the di erent architectures, we study
the distribution of planetary masses, radii, and semi-major axes
as well as the multiplicity distributions. For planetary systems
across all catalogues, this is shown in Fig. 7. We describe the
characteristics of di erent architectures in the following subsec-
tions. The discussion in the next subsection involves results de-
rived from both observed and synthetic planetary systems. In ad-Table 2. Architecture type of known multi-planetary systems (see Table

dition, we present a gallery of mass-distance diagrams showing
the four architecture classes in Appendix E.
Figure. 4 shows the coe cient of similarity of masses as a
function of the total planetary mass in a system for all synthetic
planetary systems from the Bern model. This Ô¨Ågure shows sev-
eral key aspects. Firstly, it illustrates the four architecture classes
as separate clouds of scattered points strengthening the proposed
four classes of planetary system architecture. Secondly, it shows
that the architecture framework is scale-invariant, that is, the
system architecture is sensitive only to the relative distribution
of a quantity ‚Äì and not its absolute value. For example, while
most similar system have /100Mmass in their planets (sug-
gesting a lack of giant planets), there are some similar systems
with mass values of 2000 Mfor their planets and host giant
planets. Likewise, most ordered systems host giant planets and
have'2000 Mmass in their planets, there is an ordered sys-
tems without any giant planets. Also, it illustrates that the coe -
cient of similarity partitions planetary systems into three groups:
anti-ordered, similar and mixed in one group, and ordered. This
demonstrates that the coe cient of variation is necessary to dis-
tinguish between the similar and mixed systems. Finally, the di-
agram shows that the architecture class of a system has strong
links with the total mass of planets in the system. This hints that
there must be general patterns in the formation pathways of sys-

tems of the same architecture. This topic is discussed in Paper II,
from this series.
4.2. Frequency of architecture
The frequency of each architecture class across all catalogues is
shown in Fig. 5. Similar systems are the most common archi-
tecture classes emerging from simulations, with a frequency of
80:2%. About8% of synthetic systems show mixed and
anti-ordered architectures. Ordered architecture is a rare out-
come in simulations ( 1:5%). In observations, similar class is
the most common architecture ( 59%). Fifteen observed exo-
planetary systems (out of forty-one) are part of the ordered ar-
chitecture class (37%). About5% of observed planetary
systems show mixed architecture. There are no known examples
of observed system with anti-ordered architecture.
Comparing the frequency of architecture classes for ob-
served systems with synthetically observed systems brings out
some peculiar features. Firstly, theoretical catalogues seem to
suggest that observations should Ô¨Ånd more similar systems and
fewer ordered systems. The frequency of similar (ordered) sys-
tems in our observed catalogue is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower (higher).
Secondly, while the frequency of mixed systems seems to be in
agreement with synthetic observations, this agreement is not sta-
tistically signiÔ¨Åcant.
These discrepancies probably arise from the incompleteness
prevalent in our observations catalogue. Transit surveys are con-
ducted in a manner which allows the completeness and reliability
of these survey to be estimated. The completeness of RV surveys,
on the other hand, is very di cult to estimate. Further, the obser-
vation techniques used to Ô¨Ånd the exoplanets in our observations
catalogue are heterogeneous, consisting of RV , transits, transit-

timing variations, and direct imaging; this complicates the es-
timation of completeness. The PLATO mission is an upcoming
space mission that is equipped to allow for statistical estimates
of cosmic occurrence rates of planetary system architecture in
our galaxy (Rauer et al. 2014). If more exoplanetary systems are
uniformly detected and characterised, then it would be possible
to estimate the occurrence rate of the di erent classes of system
architecture. While such a result would constitute an important
knowledge about our Universe, it could also become an excel-
lent way of constraining our knowledge of initial conditions for
planetary formation and the physical processes which shape the
system architecture. The frequency of architecture class in sim-
ulations is a direct consequence of the initial conditions and the
physical processes modelled in the Bern model.
4.3. Architecture class: similar
Planetary systems have a similar architecture when all planets in
the system have masses that are approximately similar to each
other. These planetary systems are the archetypical examples of
the peas in a pod trend. There are several well-known planetary
systems exhibiting similar architecture, such as Trappist-1 (Agol
et al. 2021), TOI-178 (Leleu et al. 2021), Kepler-20 (Buchhave
et al. 2016), and so on. This architecture is the most common
outcome of planetary formation and is also the most frequent
architecture class in our observed catalogue.
Similar systems in the Bern model are composed of several
low-mass planets. They tend to have limited diversity in plan-
etary masses when compared with the observed systems. The
mass distribution, for similar systems in the Bern model, shows
that there are many low-mass ( <1M) planets in these systems.
This peak is missing in observations as well as synthetic observa-
tions as low mass exoplanets are di cult to observe. This could,
however, be remedied in future as current radial velocity spectro-

Fig. 7. Characteristics of the architecture classes. These plots show the distribution of various quantities (columns) as function of di erent cata-
logues (rows). Left to right: Distributions of mass, radius, distance, and multiplicity in the following catalogues (top to bottom): Bern model, Bern
RV Multis, Bern KOBE Multis, Bern Compact Multis, and observations. All catalogues are described in Sect. 2. Some notable features from these
plots are discussed in Sect. 4. All individual distributions are normalised such that the area under each curve sums to unity. The dotted vertical line
in the radius distributions marks 1 :75R‚Äì approximately, the location of the well-known gap in the radius distribution (Fulton et al. 2017). Since
there are only two mixed systems with the same multiplicity ( n=4) in our observations catalogue, a vertical line replaces the density kernel. The
Gaussian density kernels in all other cases were estimated using Scott‚Äôs rule (Scott 2015).
Article number, page 11 of 28A&A proofs: manuscript no. 43751corr
The Bern RV Multis show a bimodal planetary distance dis-
tribution for similar systems (as well as for mixed and ordered).
The approximate location of the gap is 0 :28 au or 55 d (for a solar
mass star). This bi-modality is not visible in our observed cata-
logue. Planets in similar and mixed systems in the Bern Model
also show a dip around this location. In the Bern Model, in-
wardly migrating giant planets ( &100M) tend to stop around
0:4 au or 100 d. Inside this region, low-mass planets are popu-
lous. We attribute this bi-modality to these two populations of
planets. This bi-modality probably arises because planets switch
their orbital migration from type I to type II depending on their
masses (Emsenhuber et al. 2021a). This bi-modality cannot be
seen in Bern Compact Multis because we only include planets
with periods less than 100d. For Bern KOBE Multis, the com-
pleteness of the Kepler mission for large distant planets is poor
(see Fig. C.2 in Mishra et al. 2021). However, a dip at this loca-
tion in Bern KOBE Multis is visible. It would be interesting to
see if such a bi-modality is also present in the Kepler catalogue.
We tested the signiÔ¨Åcance of this bi-modality with Hartigan‚Äôs dip
test (Hartigan & Hartigan 1985). The dip test is suggestive of the
bi-modality for the Bern RV Multis and Bern KOBE Multis (p-
value <0.05) and insigniÔ¨Åcant for the other catalogues.
A system‚Äôs architecture is sensitive only to the relative distri-
bution of a quantity (such as mass) amongst its planets and not
the absolute distribution. HR 8799 o ers an example (Marois
et al. 2008) as a relatively young system with four directly im-
aged giant planets. Our framework identiÔ¨Åes the architecture
of this systems as similar. Most observed similar systems are
composed of low-mass planets ( .100M), making HR 8799 a
unique exception. This shows that the architecture framework is
sensitive only to the relative variations in the mass. Additionally,
there are only two systems (out of 1000) in our simulated cata-
logue where a similar architecture arises from only giant planets.
Even then, these two synthetic systems have only two giant plan-
ets much closer to the star than the HR 8799 planets. The Bern
Model does not produce many HR 8799-like systems. This sug-
gests that a system with similar architecture made up of only
giant planets is probably rare. One possibility could be that sys-
tems (e.g. HR 8799) with such architecture are probably di -
cult to form via core accretion pathway (Konopacky & Barman
2018). Such systems may require additional formation mecha-
nisms such as protoplanetary disk instabilities (Schib et al. 2021;
Boley et al. 2010; Kratter et al. 2010).
4.4. Architecture class: mixed
Planetary systems where the planetary masses (inside-out) show
broad increasing and decreasing variations have mixed archi-
tecture. GJ 876 and Kepler-89 host planetary systems with a
mixed class architecture. GJ 876 is an M dwarf low luminous
(0:01L) star hosting four planets with masses between
8 888M. The outer three planets are in a Laplace mean-
motion resonance (Millholland et al. 2018). Kepler-89, on the
other hand, is an early F, highly luminous ( 3:5L) star. It hosts
a compact four planet system with masses between 10  100M.
Despite the starkly di erent stellar properties, the architecture
of these two systems is analogous: CS(M)=0:12 and 0:17,
CV(M)=1:2 and 0:9, respectively. While the coe cient of simi-
larity is low for both systems, the coe cient of variation is larger
thanp
3=2, which helps us identify the architecture of these sys-
tems as mixed class. Indeed, Fig. 6 indicates that this identiÔ¨Åca-
tion is correct.The frequency of this architecture class in the Bern model
is8:2%. The Bern model‚Äôs synthetic mixed architecture
planetary systems (Fig. 6 right) tend to have numerous Earth-
mass planets outside 10 au. This parameter space (mass-distance
plane, Fig. 1), however, remains inaccessible to most exoplanet
detection techniques. These systems are also composed of super-
Earths, sub-Neptunes, Neptunes, and Jovian planets. The bi-
modality in distance distribution (discussed before) is prominent
for these architectures in Bern RV Multis. We found a Harigan‚Äôs
dip statistic of 0.03 and p-value of 0:2 (Hartigan & Hartigan
1985).
4.5. Architecture class: anti-ordered
Planetary systems where the planetary mass shows an overall
decrease with distance have an anti-ordered architecture. There
are no observed examples of this architecture class in our cata-
logue. The frequency of this architecture class in the Bern model
is8:4%. About4% of systems in Bern KOBE Multis,
3:2% of systems in Bern Compact Multis, and 1:2% of
systems in Bern RV Multis have this architecture. This shows
that it is an observationally challenging system architecture to
detect. However, even if 1% of observed exoplanetary systems
are Anti-Ordered we should already have found about 30-40
such systems. More work is necessary to identify the handful
of these systems from the already observed systems. Many cur-
rently known single hot Jupiter systems may host additional
small, distant, and as yet undetected planets ‚Äì revealing these
potentially anti-ordered systems.
Anti-ordered systems in the Bern Model are mostly com-
posed of low mass planets .5Mand giants&100M. In
the Bern Model, the radius distribution of this architecture class
peaks for Rocky and Super-Earths planets. It decreases for sub-
Neptunes and Neptunes and then increases again for Jovian plan-
ets. Many of the low-mass planets that make up this architecture
class are outside 10au, making their detection very challenging.
The multiplicity distribution shows that these systems tend to
have fewer planets than similar or mixed architecture. This is
an indication that the formation pathway of these architectures
diers considerably from the other two types of architecture.
Planets from anti-ordered architectures show a weak distance bi-
modality feature (discussed earlier in this work). This is under-
standable since these architectures consist of massive planets in
the inner parts and less massive planets in the outer parts of the
system. The distance bi-modality seems to arise from low mass
planets (migrating via type I) inside 0.28au or 55 days and giant
planets (migrating via type II) outside 0.28au or 55 days. This
adds further strength in attributing the distance bi-modality to
planetary migration.
4.6. Architecture class: ordered
Planetary systems where the planetary masses shows an overall
increase with distance have an ordered architecture. The increas-
ing mass may be monotonic (e.g. TOI-561, HD 20781, DMPP-
1,HD 160691, HD 164922) or non-monotonic (e.g. the Solar
System, Kepler-11, 55 Cnc, Kepler-48, Kepler-65). Ordered ar-
chitecture is a rare outcome for the Bern model. Observations
are generally biased against discovering small and less massive
planets which are farther away from their host star. Such biases,
however, make ordered systems the second most common archi-
tecture class. Fifteen systems in our catalogue exhibit this archi-
Article number, page 12 of 28L. Mishra et al.: Architecture Framework I ‚Äì Four classes of planetary system architecture
tecture. Unsurprisingly, the most notable known example of this
architecture class is the Solar System.
The mass and radius distributions of ordered architecture in
the Bern Model shows considerable di erence from other archi-
tecture. The mass distribution peaks around 1000 M. Most of
the Bern model‚Äôs ordered systems tend to have at least one gi-
ant planet. These systems are also composed of sub-Neptunes,
Neptunes, and Jovian planets.
5. Internal composition across architecture classes
So far we have seen the new architecture framework (Sect. 3) and
some characteristics of the four classes of architecture (Sect. 4).
In this section, we study the connection between the bulk mass
architecture classes and the internal composition of the planets.
This section demonstrates that the same architecture framework
can be used to study the multi-faceted nature of planetary sys-
tem architecture ‚Äì from bulk mass architecture to density archi-
tecture. We study several di erent aspects of the planetary in-
ternal composition: (a) radius architecture (Sect. 5.1); (b) bulk
density architecture (Sect. 5.2); (c) Core /Envelope mass archi-
tecture (Sect. 5.3); and (d) fraction of volatiles and water ice in
core architecture (Sect. 5.4). We explore these connections for
planetary systems in the simulated (Bern model) and syntheti-
cally observed catalogues (Bern RV Multis, Bern KOBE Mul-
tis, Bern Compact Multis). All results in this section are derived
from synthetic planetary systems only.
5.1. Radius architecture
Weiss et al. (2018) showed that the size of adjacent exoplanets
were similar ‚Äì coining the phrase ‚Äòpeas in a pod‚Äô to describe this
architecture. Millholland et al. (2017); Wang (2017) extended
these ideas to planetary masses, showing that the masses of ad-
jacent planets are also correlated. In Mishra et al. (2021), we
suggested that the peas in a pod trends in terms of size e ec-
tively emerge from the mass trends. Here, we attempt to set our
assumption on Ô¨Årmer ground.
Figure 8 (top) shows the coe cient of similarity for radii as
a function of the coe cient of similarity of masses, for systems
with two or more planets. This allows us to compare the system-
level radius architecture with the system-level mass architecture.
We easily see that most systems seem to follow a linear rela-
tionship. The Pearson correlation coe cient is 0.89, indicating
a strong positive correlation between the mass and radius archi-
tecture. The coe cient value increases to 0.96, when systems
with only three or more planets are considered. Since the mass-
radius relation is not a bijective function (i.e. one-to-one corre-
spondence), there are some systems that show a strong deviation
from the linear relation.
Figure 8 (bottom) shows the radii architecture for the syn-
thetic planetary systems8. This shows that most systems that
are ordered (or anti-ordered) in mass are also ordered (or anti-
ordered) in terms of radius. The Ô¨Ågure also shows that systems
which are similar or mixed in mass architecture have CS(R)0.
Systems with mass similarity have lower CV(R) compared to sys-
tems with mass mixture, suggesting that for most systems, the
8A future study could investigate the boundaries for robust architec-
ture identiÔ¨Åcation, as in Eq. 3, but based on radius instead of mass.
Such a classiÔ¨Åcation is readily applicable since radius measurements
tend to be uniformly available and are better agreed upon amongst sev-
eral observers. Data-driven approaches such as machine learning could
be useful in such an endeavour.

Fig. 8. Radii architecture. Top: The diagram shows the coe cient of
similarity of radii as a function of the coe cient of similarity of masses,
for synthetic and observed planetary systems. The dashed line shows the
corresponding linear Ô¨Åt. Bottom: Radius architecture of synthetic plane-
tary systems contrasted with the mass architecture. In the bottom panel,
the marker colour and shape indicates the bulk mass architecture of a
system and its position on the diagram suggests its radii architecture.
radius architecture closely follows the mass architecture. At the
planetary level the radius of a planet is correlated with its mass
via the planet‚Äôs chemical composition (Lopez & Fortney 2014).
Our architecture framework shows that such relationships also
exist at the system level. A few mass-ordered systems show sim-
ilarities in radius. These few systems have the following com-
mon features: two mass-ordered giant planets with similar sizes
(massesseveral MJ‚Äôs, and radius1RJ). This illustrates that
Article number, page 13 of 28A&A proofs: manuscript no. 43751corr
while mass architecture and radius architecture are related, they
are not always identical.
We conclude that the peas in a pod radius correlations gen-
erally arise from the underlying mass architecture. We consider
the mass architecture primal because planets, foremost, accrete
mass from the protoplanetary disk and, consequently, are char-
acterised by a size that is in accordance with their internal struc-
ture.
5.2. Density architecture
Bulk density (or simply density) is a directly measurable quan-
tity which is sensitive to the internal structure of a planet.
This makes density an important characteristic for understand-
ing planetary structure. The density of a planet depends on
many parameters and many physical processes. For example, a
planet‚Äôs mass may depend on its accretion history, starting loca-
tion, amount of material in disk, competition with other planets,
and so on. Giant impacts may also a ect a planet‚Äôs density, as
explained in Bonomo et al. (2019). In this section, we study the
arrangement and distribution of planetary density around their
host star, namely, the density architecture of a system.
Figure 9 (left) shows the density of a planet, simulated via the
Bern model, as a function of its mass and starting location. The
Ô¨Ågure also shows the density of solar system planets and few ob-
served exoplanets (from our catalogue). The plot can be roughly
divided into two halves: (a) planets with a mass of <100Mand
(b) planets with a mass of >100M. In our simulations, most
planets which started inside the ice line tend to have terrestrial
Earth-like densities. These planets are 0 :5 3Rand/10M.
Planets starting around or outside the ice line generally accrete
more volatile rich material and H /He gas. These planets have
lower densities due to their larger sizes. Planet which started
outside the ice line (3-10 au) show a broad diversity in their den-
sities. As they accrete more gases, their density decreases fur-
ther. These planets are roughly 2  10Rand are characterised
by masses that vary by four orders of magnitude. Planets more
massive than 100 Mseem to lie on a single curve. Since the size
of these planets remains the same ( 1RJor 11 R,), their densi-
ties increases linearly with their masses. Planets that started in
the outer regions (30-40 au) cluster on the density-mass plane.
These planets have low densities ( <2g=cm3) and low masses
(/1M).
The density architecture for simulated systems in the Bern
Model is shown in Fig. 9 (middle). An important relation be-
tween mass architecture and density architecture is seen. Some
systems which are ordered (or anti-ordered) in mass are also or-
dered (or anti-ordered) in density, that is, these systems have
large positive (or negative) CS(). In other words, simulations
suggest that planetary systems can also be ordered or anti-
ordered in density. A system is ordered in density when the in-
ner planets have small densities and the outer planets have larger
densities ‚Äì and vice-versa for density anti-ordered systems. Sys-
tems with mass architectures of similar and mixed are strongly
clustered around CS()0 and CV()<1. The inset shows
that similar mass systems tend to have small CV();while mixed
mass systems have larger CV(). This implies that some systems
that are similar (or mixed) in mass show some similarity (or mix-
ture) in density. A system with a similar density architecture will
host planets that have approximately similar densities. However,
the region CS()CV()0 is empty, indicating the absence
of planetary systems where the density of planets (inside out)
is approximately the same. While there are exceptions, overall,for many systems, the density architecture seems to follow their
mass architecture.
This approximate link between the mass and density archi-
tecture stems from massive planets ( >100M) whose densities
increase with their mass (see 9 (left)). Systems which do not host
any massive planet are mostly similar in their mass architecture
and have CS()0. The inset shows that the Aryabhata‚Äôs num-
ber increases as a system approaches the CS()CV()0
region (see Paper II for the deÔ¨Ånition of Aryabhata‚Äôs number). If
a system has more surviving planets that started from inside the
ice line, then the densities of these planets will be more similar to
each other. This means that the density architecture of a system
shows some dependence on the starting location of a planet.
We also investigated if the relation between the mass and
density architectures is observable. Figure 9 (right) shows the
density architecture for systems from our synthetically observed
catalogues. Also shown is the density architecture of some ob-
served exoplanetary systems for which the mass and radius mea-
surements were available. The density architecture of syntheti-
cally observed catalogues shows a trend which is quite unlike
Fig. 9 (middle). There is an unexpectedly good agreement be-
tween the synthetically observed systems and the observed plan-
etary systems. We attribute the peculiar shape of this plot to the
diculty of detecting distant planets. Transit and RV observa-
tions favour the detection of planets within 1 au. Many close-
in planets tend to have Earth-like densities, while planets far-
ther out have lower densities (due to either their volatile rich or
gaseous composition). Overall, this would lead to an observed
density architecture where inner planets have higher densities
and outer planets have lower densities. A situation such as this
will be characterised by negative CS(), which is readily seen
from Fig. 9 (right).
In summary, many synthetic systems show a relationship be-
tween their mass architectures and their density architectures.
Bern model systems that are ordered or anti-ordered in their
mass also tend to be ordered or anti-ordered in their densities.
The dispersion of planetary bulk densities in similar class sys-
tems is lower than mixed class systems. This relation seems to
emerge from massive planets whose densities increases linearly
with their masses (since they cannot grow their sizes any more).
These relations can be considered as a prediction from this work.
As future observations probe the outer parts of an exoplane-
tary system, we may anticipate the discovery of several systems
whose mass and density architectures are closely linked.
5.3. Core and envelope mass architecture
In this section, we show that (a) most simulated planetary sys-
tems inherit their architecture from the underlying core mass
architecture; (b) the accretion of gases tends to accentuate the
underlying core mass architecture, and (c) the observed mass ar-
chitecture of a planetary system is a gateway to studying the core
mass architecture of the system, since the two are strongly cor-
related. Exceptions to the Ô¨Årst two statements tend to arise for
those systems undergoing strong, multi-body dynamical e ects
such as planet-planet scattering.
The fraction of mass which is partitioned into a planet‚Äôs core
and its envelope is governed by planetary formation physics. The
end result is dictated by an interplay of several concurrent pro-
cesses (see Emsenhuber et al. 2021a; Mordasini et al. 2012b,
for discussion). In the core-accretion scenario, giant planets are
formed when planetary cores can undergo run-away gas accre-
tion (Pollack et al. 1996; Alibert et al. 2004, 2005). Proto-planets
that have failed to trigger runaway gas accretion comprise a di-

Fig. 10. Mass architecture as a function of core-mass architecture. Panels compare the mass architecture with the core-mass architecture via the
coecient of similarity (left) and coe cient of variation (middle). In the left panel, the points corresponding to similar systems are very tightly
clustered on the y=xline and are not visible due to over-plotting of points from other architectures. This signiÔ¨Åes the core-mass architecture is
very strongly correlated with the mass architecture for similar systems. The sum of mass in the envelope of each planet in a system is indicated in
colour. The right panel plots the coe cient of similarity for masses and core masses for systems in the synthetically observed catalogues.
verse group of planets: Earths, Super-Earths, mini-Neptunes, and
Neptunes.
The bifurcation of a planet‚Äôs mass into its core and its enve-
lope can probe the formation history. For example, in our sim-
ulations, most giant planets ( '1MJ) have about 1% of their
mass in their cores and the rest is in their gassy envelope. On
the other hand, low mass planets ( /10M) hardly accrete any
gaseous envelope. However, the mass in a planet‚Äôs core and en-
velope is not an observable. Even for the solar system planets,
internal structure models guide our knowledge of core and enve-
lope masses (see Helled et al. 2020, for a review on Uranus and
Neptune).
As giant planets dominated by their H /He envelopes are rare,
we expect a strong correlation between the mass architecture (i.e.
the arrangement and distribution of planetary masses) and the
core-mass architecture (i.e. the arrangement and distribution of
core-masses) to exist also at the system level. In Fig. 10, we show
the coe cient of similarity and the coe cient of variation of
planetary mass as a function of the coe cient of similarity and
the coe cient of variation of core mass. The colour indicates the
total mass of envelope accreted by all planets in a system.
Comparing the coe cient of similarity for planetary masses
and core masses (Fig. 10, left panel), we observe that a large frac-tion of systems ( >90%) follow the y=xline. This implies that for
most planetary systems, the arrangement and distribution of core
masses is imprinted on the mass architecture of the system. Sys-
tems which show large deviations from the y=xline have gener-
ally accreted a large amount of gaseous envelope. This suggests
that the formation of one or more giant planet is partly responsi-
ble for the deviations. We also observe another important feature.
Planetary systems that are ordered in mass are also often ordered
in their core-masses. Conversely, mass anti-ordered systems tend
to be anti-ordered in their core masses as well. In addition, or-
dered systems are either on or above the y=xline, whereas anti-
ordered systems are either on or below this line. This suggests
that the accretion of gases generally accentuates the underlying
core mass architecture.
Considering the coe cient of variation for masses and core
masses (Fig. 10, middle), we see that most of the planetary sys-
tems lie either on or above the y=xline. The CVvalue measures
the amount of variation in a set of numbers. This suggests that
the variation in total masses, for most systems, is either similar
or larger than the variation in the core masses. This is under-
standable, since the amount of gas accreted by a planet shows
a strong correlation with the mass of the planet‚Äôs core. How-
ever, there are a handful of systems where the variation in total
Article number, page 15 of 28A&A proofs: manuscript no. 43751corr
mass is less than the variation in core masses. Systems that are
similar in the mass architecture are strongly clustered over the
y=xline. This stems from the low amount of gas (0  20M)
accreted by planets in these systems. Figure 10 (middle) shows
that mixed class systems, as opposed to similar systems, form
a separate cluster. Physically, this di erence is arising from the
larger amount of gas (50  5 000 M) accreted by planets in these
systems.
Here, the question arises as to whether the strong correlation
between mass architecture and core-mass architecture is observ-
able. In Fig. 10 (right), we show CS(M) as function of CS(Mcore)
for the three synthetically observed catalogues. All three cata-
logues probe the inner regions of a planetary system. The Ô¨Ågure
shows that the correlation between mass architecture and core
mass architecture is strong in all three catalogues. This suggests
that the observed mass architecture of a planetary system can be
used to study the underlying core-mass architecture of the sys-
tem. This is potentially useful to distinguish among competing
models of planet formation.
5.3.1. Role of embryo starting location
We have seen that the core mass architecture of a system strongly
governs the overall architecture of the system. The arrangement
of planets in a system also reÔ¨Çects the Ô¨Ånal distances of these
planets. It is, therefore, instructive to understand some key as-
pects which shape these two important properties. The core mass
and the Ô¨Ånal distance of a planet are strongly inÔ¨Çuenced by,
among other e ects, the distance at which an embryo starts in
our simulations. Figure 11 shows the core mass (left) and the
Ô¨Ånal distance (right) as a function of the starting distance. In
the Bern model, lunar mass (0 :01M) protoplanetary embryos
are initialised with a random starting location between the inner
edge of the disk and 40 au. We also recall that failed embryos
(objects with a total masses <0:1M) are removed from our
analysis.
Emsenhuber et al. (2021a); Burn et al. (2021) analysed the
nature of planetary migration using migration maps. Both stud-
ies show the existence of so-called convergence zones. Within
these zones, planets can migrate outwards. However, outside this
zone inward migration is prevalent. The existence of such con-
vergence zones suggests that there ought to be regions of planet
over-densities; this are essentially regions where planets are ra-
dially ‚Äòstuck.‚Äô These studies attribute the presence of these zones
to dust opacity transitions and disc structures, Ô¨Ånding that these
zones evolve with the disc. For a 0 :01Mdisc, around a solar
mass star at 1Myr, these zones are: (a) for low-intermediate mass
planets (/1M) extending from disk inner edge to about 1au and
(b) for intermediate mass planets (1  10M) around 2-3 au.
Figure 11 (left) shows that even for embryos that start at
the same initial distance, the mass accreted by a planetary core
can di er by two to three orders of magnitude. These di er-
ences arise from (a) varying solid disc masses; (b) competition
for accretion in the feeding zone (Alibert et al. 2013); (c) dy-
namical state of solids in the disc resulting from planetesimal-
planetesimal, planetesimal-protoplanet, planetesimal-gas disc
interactions, and so on. Nevertheless, the starting distance seems
to play a signiÔ¨Åcant role in this scenario. The ice line seems to
divide the parameter space into two regions: fewer planets inside
the ice line have low mass cores ( /1M), while many planets
outside the ice line have low-mass cores.
Inside the ice line, most planets have cores of 1  10M. Plan-
ets that start very close to the star ( /0:1au) are unable to accrete
a lot of material owing to their small Hill spheres. This explainstheir small cores masses. Inside the ice line, planets belonging to
systems of mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered architecture tend to
have more massive cores than planets belonging to similar sys-
tems. Around the ice line, planets show a large variety of core
masses ranging from 0 :1Mto 100 M. Outside the ice line we
see the same trend as before: planets that are in similar systems,
for the same starting location, usually have less massive cores
than planets which belong to systems of other architectures.
The Ô¨Ånal distance of a planet depends on several factors such
as: (a) migration type (type I or type II), (b) planet‚Äôs mass, (c)
local disc properties, and (d) multi-body e ects such as N-body
scattering. The joint distribution of a planet‚Äôs Ô¨Ånal and starting
locations shows an intriguing trend. Generally, for many plan-
ets, the Ô¨Ånal distance strongly correlates with their starting loca-
tion. Orbital migration allows planets to move (mostly) inwards
‚Äì positioning many planets below the y=xline. N-body e ects
(such as planet-planet scattering or outward migration) may scat-
ter some planets further away from their host star. These planets
are located above the y=xline. Curiously, many planets which
end up farther away than their starting location were initialised
around the ice line and are mostly low massive ( /20M). We
attribute this over-density to the outward migration convergence
zone around the ice line discussed above.
Another important Ô¨Ånding is that planets inside the ice line
in similar systems probably formed in situ. Fig. 11 (right) shows
that most planets, inside the ice line, which did not migrate in-
wards are part of similar architecture systems. Conversely, most
of the planets which have migrated inwards seem to belong to
systems that have mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered architectures.
Outside the ice line, many planets have migrated inwards. Most
planets starting around 20 au (or more) accrete little mass in their
cores and show little radial displacement (Hansen & Murray
2012; Chiang & Laughlin 2013). The properties of these em-
bryos may draw some inÔ¨Çuence from our modelling choice as
well. The N-body integrator in this model is used for 20 Myr.
Longer integration times may allow some embryos to have more
massive cores via giant impacts.
5.4. Core water-ice mass fraction architecture
Our model calculates the internal structure of a planetary core
(for details see Emsenhuber et al. 2021a; Mordasini et al. 2012a).
We solved 1D di erential equations demanding mass conser-
vation and hydrostatic equilibrium, with a modiÔ¨Åed polytrope
equation serving as the equation of state (Seager et al. 2007).
The chemical composition of each planetary core is also tracked.
This is accomplished by tracking the chemical makeup of the
accreted planetesimals and other colliding planets. The underly-
ing chemical models have thirty-two refractory and eight volatile
species (Thiabaud et al. 2014; Marboeuf et al. 2014a,b). These
dierent chemical species are grouped into three di erent ma-
terials which make the planet‚Äôs core, in our model: (a) iron, (b)
silicates, and (c) ice. All refractory species (except iron) make
up the silicate mantle and all volatile species contribute to ice.
Since H 2O constitutes 60% of all ice by mass, we label this
latter component as water ice. The water mass fraction ( fice) of
each planetary core is computed.
We assume that inside the H 2O ice line, only refractory ele-
ments contribute to the solid phase of a planetesimal. Outside
this evolving ice line, due to their condensation, volatile ele-
ments also contribute to the solid phase of a planetesimal. Fig-
ure 12 (left) shows the water mass fraction of a planet‚Äôs core as
a function of its initial location. Most planets which start inside
the ice line have little to no volatiles in their cores. A jump in

ficeis seen around the ice line. Outside the ice line, most plan-
ets have at-least 40% ficein their cores. This suggests that the
history of formation and evolution of a planet is imprinted on its
water mass fraction.
We are interested in studying the ice mass fraction architec-
ture of a planetary system. However, we cannot directly apply
our framework (Eqs. 1, 2) because the water mass fraction is
a quantity that admits 0 as a value. While this can lead to ill-
deÔ¨Åned numbers, this issue has a simple remedy. For quantities
that can be 0, we propose the following modiÔ¨Åcation to Eq. 1:
CS(q)=lim
!01
n 1i=n 1X
i=1 
logqi+1+
qi+!
: (4)Numerically, we calculated the coe cient of similarity with
=10 10. We veriÔ¨Åed this step by calculating the coe cient
of similarity for quantities which do not admit zero (such as
masses). In a bootstrapped numerical experiment of 10,000 tri-
als, the coe cient of similarity for mass was calculated using
both equations (1 and 4). The relative di erence between the
two outcomes ranged between 10 12to 10 10.
The ice mass fraction architecture of Bern Model systems is
shown in Fig. 12 (middle). A prominent feature from this Ô¨Åg-
ure is that most systems have CS(fice) either close to 0 or posi-
tive. A system with CS(fice)0 and low CV(fice) will be com-
posed of planets whose core water mass fraction is similar to
one another. A system with positive CS(fice) will be composed
of planets whose core water mass fraction increases inside out.
Article number, page 17 of 28A&A proofs: manuscript no. 43751corr
Figure 11 (right) tells us that many planets that started outside
the ice line, and are water rich have not su ered any major ra-
dial displacement. Thus, a positive CS(fice) should be a default
scenario for most planetary systems. About 74% systems in the
Bern model have CS(fice)>0:1. Almost 97% of systems have
CS(fice)>0. We propose the ‚ÄòAryabhata formation scenario‚Äô to
explain the ‚Äònon-default‚Äô systems. This scenario and the related
quantity ‚ÄòAryabhata‚Äôs Number‚Äô are described in Paper II.
5.5. Frequency of dry, moist, and wet planets
We are interested in exploring the link between the water mass
fraction architecture and the mass architecture of a system. To
this end, we divide planets into three categories based on their
water mass fraction. A planet is called ‚Äòdry‚Äô if fice1%, ‚Äòmoist‚Äô
iffice2(1;40]%, and ‚Äòwet‚Äô if fice>40%. These labels serve to
simplify our analysis and allows us to see general trends between
system architecture and planetary composition. The distribution
of water mass fraction across systems of di erent architecture
classes is shown in Fig. 12 (right). While all three planet classes
are present in all four architecture classes, there are some ob-
servable trends.
Figure 12 (right) shows that similar architectures host many
of the dry planets produced in the Bern model and anti-ordered
architectures are mostly composed of wet planets. This tells us
that many of the planets that start inside the ice line become part
of similar architecture systems. Conversely, systems with anti-
ordered architecture are mostly composed of planets that started
outside the ice line. Mixed architecture systems are generally
composed of more planets that started outside the ice line than
inside, as compared to similar architecture systems. Moist plan-
ets are present in all architecture classes. We quantify the fre-
quency of dry, moist, and wet planets as a function of mass archi-
tecture class (similar, mixed, ordered, or anti-ordered), metallic-
ity (low or high), and source catalogues (Bern model, Bern Com-
pact Multis, Bern KOBE Multis, and Bern RV Multis). Figure 13
shows the planets per star (i.e. the number of each planet type di-
vided by the number of stars) across these forty sub-categories.
Overall, compared to synthetically observed catalogues,
Bern model simulations demonstrate more wet planets. This
is understandable since we are looking at the entire underly-
ing population, which includes planets from the outer parts of
these systems. Likewise, synthetically observed catalogues tend
to have more dry planets. Systems around low-metallicity stars
(regardless of the catalogue) generally tend to have a higher
frequency of dry planets as opposed to systems around high-
metallicity stars. The frequency of wet planets shows a notice-
able increase for systems around high-metallicity stars. Amongst
the di erent catalogues, Bern Compact Multis have the highest
frequency of dry planets, followed by Bern KOBE Multis, and
Bern RV Multis. Low-metallicity environments have a slightly
higher average planet per star (8835 =54116:3) than high-
metallicity environments (6722 =45514:8).
Similar systems: Systems in the underlying Bern model that
are characterised by a similar architecture tend to have many wet
planets (10 per star) and few dry or moist planets ( 3 4
per star). However, synthetically observed catalogues seem to
have a bias against the discovery of many wet planets. For the
similar class of compact multi-planetary systems, dry planets
are more common around a low-metallicity star. However, for
a high-metallicity star, the frequency of dry and wet planets is
roughly the same. For transiting systems, in the Bern KOBE
Multis, low-metallicity environments favour more dry planets
and equal proportions of wet and moist planets. Conversely,in high-metallicity environments, wet planets occur more fre-
quently than dry or moist planets. For RV systems, the fre-
quency of each planet class is approximately the same in a low-
metallicity environment. High-metallicity environments almost
double the frequency of wet planets. The average planet per star
is similar around both low metallic ( 16:8) and high metallic
environments (17:3).
Mixed systems: Mixed class systems generally have many
wet planets. It is only for compact systems around high-
metallicity stars, the frequency of dry planets is higher than wet
planets. In all other cases, the frequency of wet planets is greater
than the frequency for dry or moist planets. The average planet
per star is similar around both low-metallicity ( 15:2) and high
metallicity environments ( 15:3).
Anti-Ordered systems: Systems with anti-ordered architec-
ture have a distinct core water mass fraction architecture. These
systems are rich in wet planets. In fact, about 80% of these sys-
tems follow the Aryabhata formation scenario described in Pa-
per II. Compact anti-ordered systems may have some dry plan-
ets. For transit and RV surveys, the frequency of dry planets is
zero in our simulations. The total number of planets per star
in anti-ordered systems is slightly higher around low metallic-
ity stars (159 =198:4), as compared to high metallicity stars
(504=657:8). In the future, if an anti-ordered architecture
planetary system is to be discovered, it would be interesting to
study its core water mass fraction architecture as well. The cur-
rent work suggests that the Aryabhata‚Äôs number for these sys-
tems should be close to 0 and, irrespective of the detection tech-
nique, the system should would be expected to have many wet
planets (see Paper II); this is one of the main predictions arising
from this work.
Ordered systems: Juxtaposed directly to the anti-ordered sys-
tems, ordered systems in synthetically observed catalogues tend
to be rich in dry planets. These systems are distinct not only
because of their frequent dry planets, but also due to a low fre-
quency of wet planets. For all synthetic catalogues, moist plan-
ets occur more frequency than wet planets, which is a unique
distinguishing feature for these systems. For the Bern model,
these systems have low average planets per star: 5 around low-
metallicity stars and 3.1 around high-metallicity stars.
In summary, we note some salient features of these sys-
tem architectures. Generally, wet planets survive more fre-
quently around high-metallicity stars. One detection technique
that favours the discovery of close-in planets also favours the de-
tection of dry planets. The comparative frequency of planet (dry,
wet, or moist) per star seems to be intimately connected with
the mass architecture of the system. Similar and mixed systems
can host lots of dry or wet planets, depending on the metallicity
of the systems and detection technique. Anti-ordered systems,
forming prominently via the Aryabhata formation scenario, are
rich in wet planets. Ordered systems, in simulated observations,
are rich in dry planets and have more moist planets than wet
planets. The physical connection between the average planet per
star and the star‚Äôs metallicity is sensitive to the formation path-
ways that a system undergoes.
6. Habitability as a function of system architecture
In this paper thus far, we have described a new framework for
studying the architecture of planetary systems (Sect. 3), the char-
acteristics of the four classes of system architecture (Sect. 4),
and the relation between the mass architecture of a system and
its internal structure and composition architecture (Sect. 5). In

this section, we speculate on the idea of studying habitability as
a function of system-level architecture.
Mankind has pondered the existence of other biotic life-
forms beyond Earth, as well as outside our own Solar System.
Our current understanding of habitability stems from and is fo-
cused at an individual planetary level. We consider whether hab-
itability could be correlated with other properties of a plane-
tary system, namely, whether habitability could be a system-
level phenomenon. In this section, we speculate on the role of
planetary-system level information on the existence of habit-
able worlds in such systems. The framework we present here
for studying the system-level architecture of a planetary sys-
tem brings to light several novel questions, probing the depen-
dence of habitability and occurrence of habitable worlds (and
related concepts) on the architecture of a said system. For ex-
ample, we wonder how the occurrence rate of habitable planets
in the galaxy depends on the occurrence of the four architecture
classes.
In this section, we address this question on three levels: sys-
tem, planet, and planet ratio. We use the concept of empirical
Habitable zone (EHZ) planets from Quanz et al. (2022); Koppa-
rapu et al. (2014). Planets with masses between [0 :1;5]Mand
stellar insolation within [1 :776;0:32]Sare considered to be in-
side the EHZ. The stellar Ô¨Çux limits correspond to ‚Äòrecent Venus‚Äô
and ‚Äòearly Mars‚Äô scenarios and include the luminosity evolution
for a 1 MSolar-twin. At the system level, we note the frequency
of systems of a particular architecture to host at least one planet
in the EHZ. At the planet level, we count the frequency of planets
in the EHZ across each system architecture class. At the planet
ratio level, we show the fraction of all EHZ planets across their
architecture class. Figure 14 shows the frequency of EHZ plan-
ets, at all three levels, as a function of their system architecture
for both synthetic and observed exoplanetary systems.
Out of all synthetic systems with a similar class architec-
ture,77% host at least one EHZ planet. This is remarkably
higher than any other architecture class. 10% of systems with
mixed architecture host at least one EHZ planet. The frequency
drops to1% for anti-ordered architecture systems and 0%for ordered systems. One way to interpret these numbers could
be to look at the multiplicity distribution across each architecture
class in Fig. 7. The frequency of at least one EHZ planets across
architecture class seems to follow the multiplicity trends. Sim-
ilar and mixed architectures have comparably high number of
planets. The distribution of the Aryabhata‚Äôs number shows that
similar systems usually have higher Aryabhata‚Äôs number than
mixed systems, implying that similar systems tend to host more
planets which started from inside the ice line (see Paper II for
Aryabhata‚Äôs number). This may account for the large frequency
of similar systems which host at least one EHZ planet. The mul-
tiplicity distribution shows that anti-ordered systems often host
less planets than similar and mixed class systems, while ordered
systems have the lowest multiplicities. We see in Sect. 4.2 that
the similar class architecture is perhaps the most common archi-
tecture for planetary systems in our galaxy. These results from
the Bern model simulations suggest that observation campaigns
to detect habitable planets will Ô¨Ånd more EHZ planets in similar
class architectures.
For the observed multi-planetary systems in our catalogue,
about13% of similar class systems have at least one EHZ
planet. About 7% of ordered class exoplanetary systems in our
catalogue host at least one EHZ planet. In the mixed class ob-
served systems in our catalogue, none of them have EHZ planets
and there are no known anti-ordered class systems in our cata-
logue. These frequencies are quite di erent from their theoretical
counterparts. While the lack of a complete and reliable obser-
vations catalogue may explain the discrepancy for similar class
systems ‚Äì it does not completely explain the discrepancy for or-
dered systems. Our own planet resides in the ordered class sys-
tem of the Solar System, which is not supposed to be inÔ¨Çuenced
by issues such as completeness or detection biases. This reÔ¨Çects
the inability of Bern models to simulate a Solar System analogue
‚Äì pointing to a gap in our understanding of the physics that goes
into planetary formation and evolution. In addition, many ob-
served ordered class systems may have a di erent architecture
when more planets in these systems are detected.

Fig. 14. Planets inside the empirical habitable zone (EHZ). The left-most plot shows the frequency of planetary systems, of a given architecture
class, which host at least one planet inside the EHZ. The central-left plot shows the fraction of planets inside a given architecture class which are
in the EHZ. The central-right plot shows the fraction of all EHZ planets within a given architecture class. The rightmost plot shows the distribution
officefor EHZ planets across the architecture classes. The cartoon sketch of Earth emphasises that the only known life-harbouring planet resides
in an ordered system. The length of error bars visualises the total number of systems or planets in respective bin as: 100 =p
bin counts. The lengths
of the error bars represents the number of planetary systems (left-most panel) and the number of planets (two middle panels) which are inside
the bin. Large error bars in the leftmost panel, for example for anti-ordered architecture emerges from their low count (see Fig. 5). The Gaussian
kernel is estimated using Scott‚Äôs rule (Scott 2015)
At the planet level in our simulations, out of all synthetic
planets that exist in similar class systems, about 10% are inside
the EHZ. This frequency is, again, remarkably higher for any
other architecture class. About 1% of all simulated planets in a
mixed system are inside the EHZ. Close to 0% of all planets in
anti-ordered and ordered class architectures are inside the EHZ.
From our observational catalogue, while 5% of observed exo-
planets in similar class systems are inside the EHZ. About 3%
of observed exoplanets in ordered class systems are inside the
EHZ.
The planet ratio level shows the fraction of all EHZ planet
that belong to a particular architecture class. In the Bern model,
we see that out of all EHZ planets, about 99% are in the simi-
lar class. The share of EHZ planets by other architecture classes
is negligible. Amongst the observations, three-quarters of EHZ
planets are in similar class and the remaining are in ordered
class. The observations and theory are quite misaligned in this
scenario. We attribute this discrepancy to the absence of a com-
plete and reliable catalogue of observations.
Our observations catalogue has only 41 multi-planetary sys-
tems, of which only four host planets inside the EHZ. These
systems are Trappist-1 (three planets in EHZ), GJ 667 C (two
planets in EHZ), Solar System (two planets in EHZ), and Tau
Ceti (one planet in EHZ). The occurrence of architecture classes
and the frequency with which they host EHZ planets might be
better constrained with future observations. This may allow us
to have a better estimate of the occurrence rate of EHZ planets
as a function of architecture class.
Simulations suggest that ordered architecture is a rare out-
come of planet formation (about 1.5% of systems out of 1000
were deemed to be ordered) and yet, we live in an ordered sys-
tem. These two statements can shed new light on the rarity of life
in the galaxy. We foresee that the famous Drake equation may be
suitably modiÔ¨Åed to take into account the occurrence rate of dif-
ferent architectures and thereby set more optimal constraints on
(Sarkar 2022).
Since water plays a fundamental role for life forms on Earth,
it is interesting to probe the core water-ice fraction for the EHZ
planets. Figure 14 also shows the ficedistribution for EHZ plan-
ets in the Bern model. As we see before, most of the EHZ plan-
ets are in the similar class and 1% of EHZ planets are in the
mixed class. EHZ planets in similar systems are ‚Äòdry‚Äô, ‚Äô‚Äòmoist‚Äô,and ‚Äòwet‚Äô. In stark contrast, EHZ planets in mixed class are only
‚Äòwet‚Äô planets. We hope these results may be useful in guiding
future missions in Ô¨Ånding EHZ planets that have the potential to
harbour life.
7. Summary, conclusions, and future work
In this paper, we introduce and explore a new framework for
studying the architecture of planetary systems. Our new frame-
work allows us to study, quantify, classify, the global architecture
of an entire planetary system at the system-level; and compare
the architecture of one planetary system with another. In Sect. 3,
we detailed the new architecture framework and presented an in-
depth discussion comparing our framework with other works in
the literature. We present the coe cient of similarity and the co-
ecient of variation as two quantities that quantify our concep-
tual ideas. Our framework gives rise to a new parameter space
(theCSversus CVplane) in which individual planetary systems
can be compared with one another. Throughout this paper, we
applied this framework to study the distribution and arrange-
ment of several planetary quantities within a planetary system,
thereby understanding the system architecture for that quantity.
In this manner, we studied the mass architecture, the radius ar-
chitecture, the core mass architecture, the core water mass frac-
tion architecture, and the density architecture of synthetic and
observed planetary systems.
To study some consequences of this framework, we applied
our method to several catalogues of planetary systems (intro-
duced in Sect. 2). We curated, especially for the purposes of this
study, a catalogue of observed multi-planetary systems that have
four or more planets and include mass measurements for at least
four planets. For engendering further studies, additional stellar
and planetary properties were collected and presented in Table 1.
We also used synthetic planetary systems simulated via the Bern
model. To facilitate a comparison of theory with observations,
we prepared three synthetic observed catalogues by applying the
detection biases on the simulated planetary systems. This led to
the Bern RV Multis, Bern KOBE Multis, and the Bern Compact
Multis catalogue. We note that there are caveats present in the
datasets we used. The model-dependent results we present here
may be improved upon in future studies using better theoretical

PLATO).
Summary of architecture framework:
1. The architecture framework is model-independent and there-
fore does not su er from any caveats emerging from planet
formation theory or observations.
2. The same architecture framework can be used to study the
multi-faceted aspects of planetary system architecture. When
the framework is applied to study planetary masses, the
framework informs us of the mass architecture of the sys-
tem, namely, the arrangement and distribution of masses in
the planetary system. In this way, we can use this framework
to study the mass architecture, radii architecture, eccentricity
architecture, and so on for the same system. In this series of
work, we identiÔ¨Åed the architecture of a system with its bulk
mass architecture.
3. Planetary system architecture can be one of four classes that
are derived from our framework: similar, mixed, ordered, and
anti-ordered.
4. A planetary system‚Äôs architecture is of similar class when the
masses of all the planets within such a system are similar to
each other. This architecture class corresponds to the ‚Äòpeas
in a pod‚Äô architecture trend reported in the literature.
5. The architecture class of a planetary system is ordered (or
anti-ordered) when the planetary masses in such systems
tend to increase or decrease from inside-out.
6. Planetary systems of mixed class architecture host planets
whose masses show broad increasing and decreasing varia-
tions.
Our key model-dependent Ô¨Åndings are as follows:
1.Frequency of architecture class: Systems with similar bulk
mass architecture are the most common outcome of simula-
tions, followed by the other three architecture classes. Our
model suggests that similar architecture should be the most
common exoplanetary system architecture in our Galaxy and
beyond. This explains why radius similarity in exoplanets
was already detected from the Ô¨Årst four months of Kepler
data (Lissauer et al. 2011).
2.Distance bi-modality: We found hints of a bi-modality in
the exoplanetary distance distribution arising from the two
dierent modes of orbital migrations. This bi-modality is
readily visible (see Fig. 7) for similar and mixed mass ar-
chitecture exoplanetary systems observed via RV .
3.Core mass architectures: We found that for most systems,
the bulk mass architecture is inherited from the core mass ar-
chitecture. In addition, the accretion of gases tends to high-
light the underlying core mass architecture by amplifying it.
In this way, the observed mass architecture of a system could
serve as a gateway for studying the distribution and arrange-
ment of the planetary core masses, which tends to be simpler
for theoretical modelling.
4.In situ formation: We found that most planets belonging to
the similar bulk mass architecture class form in situ inside
the ice line. In contrast, planets inside the ice line belong-
ing to mixed, anti-ordered, and ordered show large inward
migrations.
5.Core water-ice mass fraction architectures: Synthetic
planetary systems were found to have two scenarios for their
core water mass fraction architecture. The default scenario
consists of relatively more dry planets in the inner parts of
a system and more wet planets in the outer parts of the sys-
tem. This is probably a direct consequence of the startinglocation of planets: planets starting inside (or outside) the
ice line tend to be dry (or wet). About one-Ô¨Åfths of simulates
systems do not follow the default scenario described above.
We propose the ‚ÄòAryabhata formation scenario‚Äô to explain
their core-water mass fraction architecture (see Paper II).
6.Linking architecture and internal composition: We found
that wet planets are more likely to survive around high-
metallicity stars. Among other predictions, we showed that
anti-ordered observed systems should be rich in wet worlds,
while ordered observed systems are expected to have many
dry planets (based on the core-accretion planet formation
paradigm).
7.Density Architectures: Synthetic systems that are ordered
(or anti-ordered) in mass tend to also be ordered (or anti-
ordered) in their bulk densities. Some mass similar systems
may also have low dispersion in their planetary bulk densi-
ties. The density architecture is sensitive to the Aryabhata‚Äôs
number (i.e. the starting location of various surviving plan-
ets; see Paper II). The density architecture of observed sys-
tems is in good agreement with the density architecture of
synthetically observed simulated systems. Detection biases
seem to favour the discovery of planetary systems where the
densities show anti-ordering, mixing, or similarity.
8.Radius architectures: The radius architecture of most plan-
etary systems closely follows their mass architecture. There-
fore, most mass similar systems also show similarity in ra-
dius (also for mass mixed, ordered, or anti-ordered systems).
However, this is not always true. Future studies can calibrate
a classiÔ¨Åcation scheme based on planetary radii.
9.Habitability as a system-level phenomenon: We reÔ¨Çected
on the prospect of studying habitability as a function of
system-level properties such as system architecture. Similar
architecture systems represent an excellent observation tar-
get for Ô¨Ånding life outside the solar systems because these
systems tend to host many more planets inside the empirical
habitable zone that other architecture classes.
10. The current version of the Bern model seems to have dif-
Ô¨Åculty in producing planets inside the EHZ of an ordered
architecture system. Nevertheless, more data is required to
conclude whether the existence of Earth, an inhabited planet
in an ordered system, is an exception or whether there are
additional gaps in our understanding of planet formation.
This paper is the Ô¨Årst in a series. The current work presents a
new testing ground, the architecture space, for theoretical mod-
els and for comparing observations with theory. We can now
constrain our understanding of planet formation not only on the
level of an individual planet ‚Äì but at the global systemic level.
This is a multi-faceted approach, since the system architecture
of several quantities can now be uniformly assessed and com-
pared with observations. In our next paper (Paper II), we show
another important aspect emerging from this architecture frame-
work which asserts that systems with comparable architecture
often have the same formation pathways. We present ideas to
further the nature versus nurture debate around planet forma-
tion. While similar architectures are usually a product of their
starting conditions, stochastic multi-body e ects are responsible
for shaping the other three architecture classes. This work leads
to several future studies which will be presented in other papers
in this series. Davoult et al. (in prep.) explore how the present ar-
chitecture framework can be employed for an e cient usage of
telescope time to hunt for habitable worlds. Other possible ex-
plorations that emerge from this work include: (a) a data-driven
approach to classifying planetary architecture based on radii and

(b) a suitable modiÔ¨Åcation to Drake‚Äôs equation that accounts for

Appendix A: Bern Model: Additional details
In this section, we provide some additional details on the physics
included in the Bern model and how it is utilised to simulate syn-
thetic planetary systems. Finally, we give an overview on com-
parisons between the output of the Bern Model and observed
planetary systems. For the historic development, we refer to Al-
ibert et al. (2004, 2005); Mordasini et al. (2009); Alibert et al.
(2011); Mordasini et al. (2012a,b); Alibert et al. (2013); Fortier
et al. (2013); Marboeuf et al. (2014b); Thiabaud et al. (2014);
Dittkrist et al. (2014); Jin et al. (2014) and reviews in Benz et al.
(2014); Mordasini (2018).
The Bern model is based on the core accretion paradigm
of planetary formation (Pollack et al. 1996). The model in-
cludes stellar evolution for a solar-mass star, using evolution
tracks from Bara e et al. (2015). The star interacts with the
protoplanetary disk and inÔ¨Çuences its thermodynamical proper-
ties. The protoplanetary disk has two phases: gas and solid. We
model this disk using the approaches of viscous angular momen-
tum transport (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; Veras & Armitage
2004; Hueso & Guillot 2005). Turbulence is characterised by the
Shakura & Sunyaev (1973) approach, with =210 3. Gas
from the disk is accreted by planets, host star, and lost via photo-
evaporation. The 1D geometrically thin disk evolution is studied
up to 1000 au. The initial mass of this gas disk and its lifetime
are randomly drawn for each run of the simulation. The solid
phase of the disk is composed of a swarm of planetesimals. The
solid disk is modelled as a Ô¨Çuid which evolves via (a) accretion
by growing planets; (b) interaction with the gaseous disk; (c) dy-
namical stirring from planets and other planetesimals; and so on
(Fortier et al. 2013). The initial mass of the solid disk depends
on the metallicity of the star and also on the condensation state
of the molecules in the disk (Thiabaud et al. 2014). The host star
metallicity is randomly drawn for each run of the simulation.
We added 100 protoplanetary embryos to the protoplanetary
disk. The initial location of each embryo was varied from one
simulation to another. It was also ensured that no two embryos
start within 10 hill radii of each other (Kokubo & Ida 1998,
2002). Embryos accrete from their feeding zones and any over-
lap may lead to competition (Alibert et al. 2013). The accretion
rate depends on the collision probability between a protoplanet
and a planetesimal, which in turn is inÔ¨Çuenced by the dynamical
state of the solid disk.
Gas accretion occurs in several phases (Mordasini et al.
2012b). Initially, the gas disk smoothly transitions as a gaseous
envelope around all planets ‚Äì the attached phase. For planets that
are massive enough to undergo runaway gas accretion, the rate
of gas supply from the disk may not be enough. In these scenar-
ios, the planet detaches from the gas disk and rapidly contracts
toRJ. After the gas disk dissipates, all planets are in the isolated
phase. Gas accretion from the disk is no longer possible and in
this phase, the planets contract and cool. For all the planets, their
internal structure is modelled at each time step. We assume plan-
ets are spherically symmetric and composed of accreted materi-
als that arranges itself in layers: iron code, silicate mantle, water
ice, and H /He gaseous envelope (if accreted).
Next, we use these recipes to simulate several thousands of
planetary systems in an approach called population synthesis
(Emsenhuber et al. 2021b). We start 1000 star-disk-embryo sys-
tems with some Ô¨Åxed as well as some randomly drawn proper-
ties. The initial properties are inspired by observations of disks
Tychoniec et al. (2018). The then numerically modelled these
systems, endowing them with additional physics at the same
time. Numerically, we incorporated multi-body dynamical in-teractions via N-body simulations. Planet-disk interactions lead-
ing to orbital migration and eccentricity and inclination damping
were also incorporated in the N-body Coleman & Nelson (2014);
Paardekooper et al. (2011); Dittkrist et al. (2014). We followed
these numerically intensive steps for 20 Myrs and then stopped
theN-body calculations. The model then continued to evaluate
the internal structure of all planets in the system for 10 Gyrs.
The recent version of these simulations has been published
in the New Generation Planetary Population Synthesis (NGPPS)
series of papers (Emsenhuber et al. 2021a,b; Schlecker et al.
2021a,b; Burn et al. 2021; Mishra et al. 2021). The output of
these models have been compared with observations in several
works. Drazkowska et al. (2022) compares the occurrence rates
of synthetic systems with observations. Schlecker et al. (2021a)
studies the warm Super Earth and cold Jupiter correlation in the
synthetic systems. Mishra et al. (2021) analyse the ‚Äôpeas in a
pod‚Äô architecture and compare synthetic systems with observa-
tions from Weiss et al. (2018). Mulders et al. (2018) present a
detailed comparison of the synthetic models with Kepler obser-
vations.

Fig. C.1. Maximum value of the coe cient of similarity (blue) and the
theoretical maximum value of the coe cient of variation (orange) is

Appendix C: Derivation of limits
We consider a set Qof quantities q, namely,Q=fqigwhere
qicould be the mass, radius or other parameter of a planet, and
the index, i2[1;n];identiÔ¨Åes a planet (with 1 being the inner-
most planet). We assume that all qi0. The quantities qiare
expressed as:
qi=q0(1ti): (C.1)
The quantities, qi, are decomposed around some value q0such
that all tiare minimised; tiis a measurement of the fractional
dierence (or tolerance) between q0andqi. Since all individual
tolerances are a positive quantity, they will satisfy the following
relation:
0tit: (C.2)
Appendix C.1: Mean
Let us consider the mean of the quantities, ¬Ø qi:
¬Øqi=Q
n=P
iqi
n
=q0
n nt1t2 tn: (C.3)
The mean takes its maximum value only when all individual ti
values take their maximum and are added up. This gives:
max ¬Øqi=q0 1+t: (C.4)
Similarly, the minimum value of the mean is:
min ¬Øqi=q0 1 t: (C.5)
The extreme value of the mean occurs when all the individual
quantities are extremised. However, in this scenario, since all
quantities are equal, the coe cient of variation is identically 0.Appendix C.2: CoefÔ¨Åcient of similarity
We start with the deÔ¨Ånition of the coe cient of similarity,
CS(q)=1
n 1i=n 1X
i=1 
logqi+1
qi!
: (C.6)
Inserting Eq. C.1, in the deÔ¨Ånition, we get:
CS(q)=1
n 1i=n 1X
i=1 
log1ti+1
1ti!
: (C.7)
This formulation shows that the coe cient of similarity depends
only on the fractional di erences (tolerances) between qivalues
‚Äì and not on their actual values. This is a desirable property.
Next, we evaluate the max CSas,
maxCS(q)=max"1
n 1i=n 1X
i=1 
log1ti+1

;

n 1max"i=n 1X

log1ti+1
1ti!#
;
=1
n 1i=n 1X
i=1logmax"1ti+1
1ti#
: (C.8)
In the Ô¨Årst step, we commuted the max operator with the frac-
tion ( n 1) 1because we are interested in the maximum for a
constant n. Next, knowing that the maximum of a sum occurs at
the sum of maximum summands and that logis a monotonically
increasing function, we further commute the max operator.
We observe the following:
max"1ti+1
1ti#
when(
ti+1!+t
ti! t)
: (C.9)
This implies that
max CS(q)=log1+t
1 t;
min CS(q)= max CS=log1 t
1+t; (C.10)
where the second equality can be similarly derived. Fig. C.1
shows the variation of max CSas a function of tolerance t. We
note that the limits of the coe cient of similarity do not depend
onn, and we veriÔ¨Åed our results with numerical simulations. 
Appendix C.3: CoefÔ¨Åcient of Variation
We start with the deÔ¨Ånition of the coe cient of variation,
CV(q)=(q)
¬Øq; (C.11)
and we note that the minimum value of the coe cient of vari-
ation is zero and it occurs when all qivalues are equal, thereby
giving no variance.
In the literature, we can Ô¨Ånd some derivations for the max-
imum value of the coe cient of variation (Katsnelson & Kotz
1957; Sharma et al. 2010). Katsnelson & Kotz (1957) show that
the upper limit of the coe cient of variation isp
n 1 when all
but one qiis zero. However, this limit is only a particular case
of our formulation (speciÔ¨Åcally, q1=q0andqi,1=0). Here, we
derive the limits for a more general scenario.
Article number, page 25 of 28A&A proofs: manuscript no. 43751corr
We consider that:
C2
V=1
ni=nX
i=1
1 qi
¬Øq| {z }
=A2
: (C.12)
Here, we have squared the deÔ¨Ånition of CVand used the def-
inition of the standard deviation (q). As an aside, we note
that the equation above shows that the coe cient of variation
is zero when all qi=¬Øq, as noted before. We note that the max-
imum value of C2
Voccurs when the term A(in parenthesis) is
maximised. DenotingP
i=1qibyQ, we consider the term in the
parenthesis,
A=1 nqi
Q=Q nqi
Q: (C.13)
The condition for the general maxima of the coe cient of
variation, in our formulation, is when one of the quantity (say q1
takes the largest possible value, while all others take the smallest
possible value):
q1=q0(1+t)
qi,1=q0(1 t): (C.14)
The mean in this scenario becomes (marked with00):
¬Øq00=q0(1+t)+(n 1)q(1 t)

coecient of variation becomes:
maxCV(q)=00(q)
¬Øq00=2tp

n(1 t)+2t: (C.18)
This expression recovers the particular case derived in lit-
erature when we set t=1. From this expression, we note that
the upper limit of the coe cient of variation does not depend on
the actual values of the quantities, but it depends on the number
of quantities in the set, Q;and the maximum tolerance, t. This
new formulation allows us to extract the upper limit of the co-
ecient of variation for any set whose maximum tolerance, t;is
known. Interestingly, the above expression gives appropriate re-
sult when absurd inputs are considered. For example, when there
are no planets in a system, max CVn=0=p
 1, and when there
is only one planet in a system, max CVn=1=0. For a system of
two planets, the upper limit is exactly the fractional di erence
(or tolerance), that is, max CVn=2=t.
Furthermore, varying over n, and assuming t2[0;1), allows
us to derive the theoretical maximum possible value for the co-
ecient of variation. This occurs at n=2
1 tand gives:
max CV(q)n=2
1 t(q)=tp

Figure C.1 shows the variation of the theoretical max ;CV, as a
function of tolerance t.Appendix D: ClassiÔ¨Åcation boundaries for
architectures classes
In this section, we present some considerations that motivate
the boundaries between the four architecture classes for plan-
etary masses. In the current formulation (Eq. 3), there are two
boundaries that need to be identiÔ¨Åed. We deal with the distinc-
tion between similar and mixed class Ô¨Årst, and then distinguish
ordered /anti-ordered architecture classes.
Appendix D.1: Similar versus mixed
We saw in Sect. 3.2, it is di cult to distinguish between mixed
and similar architecture classes using the coe cient of similar-
ity alone. Mixed systems are characterised by large increasing
or decreasing variations, which may cancel each other out and
lead to small values of CS(M). Nevertheless, the coe cient of
variation can distinguish between large variations in values. Fig-
ure D.1 shows the CV(M) as a function of the number of planets
in a planetary system. The left panel shows all synthetic sys-
tems from the Bern model, while we only show systems with
jCS(M)j0:2 in the right panel.
Clearly, there are two clusters of planetary systems. The clus-
ter on the lower right-hand side corresponds to similar class sys-
tems. Mixed systems, having large values of CV(M), are spread
over the top left region. It is clear that the boundary between
similar and mixed classes depends on the number of planets. The
black line (corresponding to y=p
n 1
2) neatly separates the two
clusters. We have chosen this equation to disentangle similar ar-
chitectures from the mixed class. This equation has, incidentally,
two key properties: 1) it ensures that no two planet system can
be of mixed architecture and 2) it happens to be exactly half of
the maximum possible value of the coe cient of variation.
Appendix D.2: Ordered and anti-ordered
Having motivated the boundary between similar and mixed
class, we are now left with three groupings of architecture
classes. These three groupings correspond to CS(M)<<0 (anti-
ordered), CS(M)0 (similar /mixed), and CS(M)>>0 (or-
dered). This suggests that we require two boundaries to distin-
guish these three groups. However, we posit that the boundaries
between ordered and anti-ordered should be symmetric around
0. Thus, we are left with only one boundary.
ordered (or anti-ordered) systems di er in their architec-
ture from similar /mixed classes in that the quantity (mass here)
continues to show an increasing (or decreasing) trend with dis-
tance. For all planetary systems in the Bern model, we measure
the Spearman correlation coe cient, R;between the planetary
masses and their distance from the host star. The Spearman R,
measuring the monotonicity between two datasets, varies from
-1 to +1, with 0 indicating no correlation. A positive correlation
implies that as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations im-
ply that as x increases, y decreases.
Figure D.1 shows the CS(M) of synthetic systems as func-
tion of their Spearman correlation R (mass and distance). We
note that there is a large cluster of points towards CS(M)0.
This group corresponds to the similar and mixed architecture
classes. There are some points to the top right (including those
with R= +1 ‚Äì corresponding to planetary systems in which plan-
etary masses are monotonically increasing with distance). There
is a scatter of points towards the bottom-left (including some
systems with R= 1).

lassiÔ¨Åcation boundaries for architecture classes. Left: Boundary between similar and mixed class. The panel show the coe cient of
variation for synthetic planetary systems as a function of the number of planets in a system for systems with jCS(M)j0:2. Two
clusters are clearly distinguishable, allowing us to Ô¨Åx the boundary between the similar and mixed architecture classes. Right:
Boundary between ordered and anti-ordered. This plot shows the coe cient of similarity of synthetic planetary systems as a
function of the Spearman correlation coe cient between the planetary masses and distances of that system. Thick horizontal lines
correspond to potential boundaries.
First, we note that the comparison of the coe cient of sim-
ilarity with Spearman R fulÔ¨Åls some expectation. For example,
there are no points in bottom-right or top-left sections of this
plot. Second, our objective is to isolate the central cluster of
points from all other scattered points. We note that jCS(M)j=0:1
fails as a boundary, since it does not include the full central clus-
ter. BothjCS(M)j=0:2 and 0:3 could succeed. Going beyond,
a value of 0.3 would add many unnecessary points to the central
cluster.
To further motivate our choice of boundary, namely,
jCS(M)j=0:2, we show the mass-distance diagram of 12 ran-
domly selected systems with  0:3<CS(M)< 0:2 (out of 19)
in Fig. D.2. We note that all systems show the qualitative fea-
tures of an anti-ordered system, namely, massive planets in the
inner region and small planets in the outer region. Since all of
these planets have their CS(M)< 0:2, we usejCS(M)j=0:2
as a boundary between ordered, anti-ordered, and similar +mixed
architecture classes. Future works may explore improvements to
our selected boundaries using additional ideas from K-means or
hierarchical clusterings.
