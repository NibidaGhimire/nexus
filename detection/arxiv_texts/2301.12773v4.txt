Abstract  
Magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction could be a “game -changer ” for liquid hydrogen industry. Although heav y 
rare-earth based magnetocaloric materials show strong magnetocaloric effects in the temperature range required 
by hydrogen liquefaction (77 ~ 20 K), the high resource criticality of the heavy rare -earth elements is a major 
obstacle for upscaling this eme rging liquefaction techno logy. In contrast, the higher abundances of the light rare -
earth elements make their alloys highly appealing for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction. Via a mean -field 
approach, it is demonstrated that tuning the Curie temperature (TC) of an idealized light rare -earth based 
magnetocaloric material towards lower cryogenic temperatures leads to larger maximum magnetic and adiabatic 
temperature changes (ΔS T and ΔT ad). Especially in the vicinity of the condensation point of hydrogen (20 K), ΔS T 
and ΔT ad of the optimized light rare -earth based material are predicted to show significantly large values. Following 
the mean -field approach and taking the chemical and physical similarities of the light rare -earth elements into 
consideration, a method of designing light rare -earth intermetallic compounds for hydrogen liquefaction is used: 
tunning T C of a rare -earth alloy to approach 20 K by mixing light rare -earth elements with different de Gennes  
factors. By mix ing Nd and Pr in Laves phase (Nd,Pr)Al 2, and Pr and Ce in Laves phase (Pr, Ce) Al2, a fully light 
rare-earth intermetallic series with large magnetocaloric effects covering the temperature range required by 
hydrogen liquefaction is deve loped, demonstrating a competitive maximum  effect compared to the heavy rare -
earth compound DyAl 2.

1. Intro duction  
Discovered in 1917 by Weiss and Picard , magnetocaloric 
effect  is a cooling or warming effect of a magnetic material 
being exposed to a magnetic field  [1]. Soon after its discovery, 
magnetic cooling has been successfully applied to attaining 
extremely low temperature  [2, 3] . In 1949, the Nobel prize in 
chemistry was awarded to Giauque, who developed a 
magnetic refrigeration device to approach absolute zero  [4].  
Nowadays , global climate change caused by greenhouse -
gas emissions threatens human civilization with grave 
consequences. In order to achieve climate -neutrality, new energy concepts emphasizing technologies that improve 
energy efficiency, or replace fossil fuels ar e required  [5]. 
Ideally releasing no pollutants and greenhouse gases, green 
hydrogen is finally set to be the fuel for the future  [6–8]. 
Hydrogen liquefaction  is important for efficient storage and 
transportation of hydrogen energ y [7, 9, 10] . Howe ver, liquid 
hydrogen is expensive due to the low efficiency of the 
conventional liquefaction technologies  based on Joule -
Thomson expansion  [11, 12] . Recently, there is a growing 
interest in magnetocaloric liquefaction for hydrogen and other 
industrial gases  [13–25]. The emerging magnet ocaloric 
liquefaction technology is in principle more efficient  [5, 26 –Journal XX (XXXX) XXXXXX  W. Liu et al   
 2  
 32], making the promise of hydrogen fuel being affordable for 
the society to reach climate -neutrality.  
If pre -cooled by liquid nitrogen, the temperature range 
required by magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction is from 77 
(condensation point of nitrogen) to 20 K (condensation point 
of hydrogen). For the success of a practical application of 
magnetocaloric hydr ogen liquefaction on an industrial scale, 
affordable magnetocaloric materials with large isothermal 
magnetic entropy and adiabatic temperature changes ( Δ𝑆𝑇 and 
Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑) in the target temperature regime under affordable 
magnetic fields are needed  [33–38]. In this work, we focus on 
the criticality of raw elements, the two physical quantities Δ𝑆𝑇 
and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 in temperature range of 77 ~ 20 K under magnetic 
field changes such as 2 T, which can be realized by Nd -Fe-B 
permanent magnets  [5], or 5 T, which can be generated by 
commerc ial superconducting magnets  [32].  
Rare -earth  based magnetocaloric materials are one big 
family of the magnetocaloric materials for hydrogen 
liquefaction  [37, 39, 40] . Lanthanide rare -earth elements can 
be divided into two major groups: light rare -earth elements 
(La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and heavy rare -earth elements (Gd, Tb, 
Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu ). Putting aside the criticality of the 
raw materials  for a moment , heavy rare -earth  based 
magnetocaloric materials would be strong contenders for 
magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction in the context of 
performance. Materials such as HoB 2 [15, 41, 42] , ErCo 2 [43, 44], DyAl 2 [45], and ErAl 2 [45, 46]  show large Δ𝑆𝑇 and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 
due to the large magnetic moments of the heavy rare -earth 
ions, and they are often proposed to be used in an active 
magnetic regenerator for hydrogen liquefaction. Because of 
the excellent magnetocaloric properties, heavy rare -earth  
based materials are in tensively studied.  
In contrast, light rare -earth  based magnetocaloric 
materials for hydrogen liquefaction are less investigated  since  
their magnetocaloric effects are usually weaker due to their 
smaller magnetic moments  [45]. Figure 1 (a) shows the 
theoretical effective magnetic moment 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 and the de 
Gennes  factor (𝐺) of the rare -earth ions  [47]. The rare -earth 
ions are divided into three categories, namely the light rare -
earth ions, Eu3+, and the heavy rare -earth ions. Pr3+ has the 
highest theoretical 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 of 3.58 𝜇𝐵 among the light rare -earth 
ions, whereas the heavy rare -earth ions from Gd3+ to Tm3+ 
have a theoretical 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 larger than 7.5 𝜇𝐵.  
However, the criticality of the raw materials cannot be 
ignored for a viable industrial -scale application. The 
consumption of H 2 in EU is predicted to reach 2250 TWh/year 
by 2050 according to Hydrogen Roadmap Europe  [48]. If 
about one -third of H 2 needs to be transported and stored in its 
liquid state, one would require about 13,000 small -scale 
liquefaction plants with a production capacity of 5 tons per 
day. Providing a potential hydrogen liquefier using

 magnetocaloric material HoAl 2 as the refrig erant for the final 
cooling state operating at 20 K at a frequency of 1 Hz in fields 
of 7 T, about 1 ton of holmium would be needed  [49]. This 
means a total of 13,000 tons for the EU alone, and the total 
holmium production is a measly 10 tons  per year  [50].  
Heavy rare -earth elements belong to the highly critical 
elements  [51, 52] . One contribution to the high criticalities is 
their poor abundances on the earth’s crust. Figure 1 (b) shows 
the relative abundances of Ni, Co, Cu, and the rare -earth 
elements on the earth’s crust  [53]. Heavy rare -earth elements 
such as Tb, Ho, Tm, and Lu are not abundant, wh ereas light 
rare-earth metal Ce is even more abundant than Cu, and light 
rare-earth elements  La and Nd , and Y  are more abundant than 
Co. The total abundances of the heavy rare -earth elements 
combined are not as rich as that of Nd alone. Figure 1 (c) plots 
the prices (always volatile)  of the rare -earth oxides in year 
2018 and 2021 for Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, and Dy  
[54, 55] . The prices of the heavy rare -earth oxides, namely for 
Tb, Dy, are over 400 $/kg in 2021, whereas the prices of the 
Pr and Nd oxides are around 50 $/kg, and the prices of Y, La, 
Ce, Sm oxides are just several dollars per kg. Eu and Gd 
oxides are also relatively cheap in comparison with Tb and Dy 
oxides. This is because they are not as largely used in industry 
as Tb and Dy.  
It needs to be emphasized that criticality is much more 
than just simple geological abundances. Factors such as 
mining , beneficiation, hazardous by -products, separation (and 
their social and ecological consequences along this value 
chain) , geopolitics , trade restrictions and monopolistic supply 
in terms of demand vs. supply, need to be understood and 
quantified in terms of LCA (Life -Cycle -Analysis) and LCC 
(Life -Cycle -Costing)  [56]. Nevertheless, the discussion above 
points out that the high criticality of the heavy rare -earth 
elements questions the feasibility of using heavy rare -earth  
based magnetocaloric materials for hydrogen liquefaction in a 
viable industrial scale  [57, 58] . Taking the dominant 
abundance of the light rare -earth elements over the heavy rare -
earth elements into consideration, it is more feasible to use 
light rare -earth  based magnetocaloric materials for hydrogen 
liquefaction. In this work, we aim at developing a light rare -
earth  based  material system with sufficient magnetocaloric 
effects covering a full temperature range (77 ~ 20 K) required 
by magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction.  
It is worth mention ing that much  work has been done on 
tuning the transition temperature of heavy rare-earth 
magnetocaloric materials . Mixing two different heavy rar e-
earth elements on the rare -earth sites is a widely used method. 
Examples are several works on heavy rare -earth  Laves phas es 
RNi 2, RAl 2, and RCo 2 (R: rare-earth element ) systems : the 
Dy1−xErxNi2 (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75)  [59], the Tb 1-xErxNi2 (x = 
0.75, 0.5, 0.25 )[60], the Tb 1-xHo xNi2 (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 )[61], 
the Ho 1-xErxNi2 (x =0. 25, 0.5, 0.75 ) [62], the Tm xDy 1-xAl2 
(0≤x≤1 )[13], the (Er xR1−x)Co 2 (R=Ho, Dy ; 0≤x≤1 ) [63] and the ErxDy 1-xAl2 (x = 0.45, 0.67,  0.9) [64]. Following these 
studies,  we apply  this method to the light rare -earth Laves 
phases : mixing different light rare -earth elements on the rare-
earth sites  to tune the transition temperature within 20 ~ 77 K 
for magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction .  
2. Mean -field Approach  
Inspired by the sharply increas ing trends of Δ𝑆𝑇 and 
Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 with decreasing 𝑇𝐶 in the vicinity of the condensation 
point of hydrogen (20 K) for heavy rare -earth  based 
magnetocaloric materials  demonstrated by a mean -field 
approach  from  our previous work  (Ref. [45] ), we focus in this 
work on the light rare -earth  based magnetocaloric materials. 
We continue to develop the mean -field approach used in the 
aforementioned work, where the detailed description can be 
found  [45]. It is worth mentioning that  using the mean -field 
model to describe  the magnetocaloric properties is a well -
known method , as used in Ref. [65–69]. In some studies , also 
effects related to the crystal line electric  field are taken  into 
consideration  [70–72]. In this work,  we aimed at providing a  
simple  way to understand the sharply increasing feature of 
magnetocaloric effect of  the light  rare-earth magnetocaloric 
materials with a Curie temperature in the vicinity of hydrogen 
condensation point . 
The total entropy change 𝑆 of a magnetocaloric material 
is contributed by three items, namely the magnetic entropy 
𝑆𝑚, the lattice entropy 𝑆𝑙, and the electronic entropy 𝑆𝑒: 
 𝑆=𝑆𝑚+𝑆𝑙 +𝑆𝑒 , (1) 
The equation to calculate the magnetic entropy is given 
as [73]: 
 𝑆𝑚=𝑁𝑀𝑘𝐵[ln(sinh2𝐽+1
2𝐽𝑥
sinh1
2𝐽𝑥)−𝑥𝐵𝐽(𝑥)], (2) 
with 𝑥=𝜇𝜇0𝐻+3𝐽
𝐽+1𝑘𝐵𝑇𝐶𝐵𝐽(𝑥)
𝑘𝐵𝑇. 𝐻 is the magnetic  field,  𝐽 the 
total angular momentum, 𝑁𝑀 the number of “magnetic 
atoms”, 𝑘𝐵 the Boltzmann constant,  𝜇 the atomic magnetic 
moment, 𝑇𝐶 the Curie temperature, 𝜇0 the vacuum 
permeability, and 𝐵𝐽(𝑥) the Brillouin function. A m ore 
detailed descri ption on Equatio n (2) can be found in Ref. [73]. 
The lattice entropy is given as  [73]: 
   𝑆𝑙=−3𝑁𝑘𝐵[1−exp (−𝑇𝐷
𝑇)] 
          +12𝑁𝑘𝐵(𝑇
𝑇𝐷)3
∫𝑥3
exp(𝑥)−1𝑑𝑥.𝑇𝐷

0 (3) 
where 𝑇𝐷 is the Debye temperature, 𝑁 the total number of 
atoms, and 𝑥 can be regarded as a variable in the range of 0 ~ 
𝑇𝐷/T. The electronic entropy is given by  [73]  
 Journal XX (XXXX) XXXXXX  W. Liu et al   
 4  
  𝑆𝑒=∫𝐶𝑒
𝑇𝑑𝑇𝑇
0=𝛾𝑇 , (4) 
where 𝛾 is the Sommerfeld coefficient and 𝐶𝑒 is the electronic 
heat capacity ( 𝐶𝑒=𝛾𝑇). In the present work, 𝑆𝑒 is neglected 
out of simplification , since  mostly  𝐶𝑒 is dominant  only at 
sufficiently low temperatures  [74]. 
Constructing the total entropy  𝑆(𝑇,𝐻) curves by 
summing 𝑆𝑚 and 𝑆𝑙, the isothermal magnetic and adiabatic 
temperature change s (Δ𝑆𝑇 and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑) are given by  [73]  
 Δ𝑆𝑇(𝑇,𝐻)=𝑆(𝑇,𝐻)−𝑆(𝑇,0) , (5)  Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑(𝑇,𝐻)=𝑇(𝑆,𝐻)−𝑇(𝑆,0), 
where 𝑇(𝑆,𝐻) is the inverse function of 𝑆(𝑇,𝐻). More details 
on Equation (1)~(5) can be fou nd in Ref. [73]. 
We assume an idealized Nd - alloy family with the T C of 
its alloys varying from 300 K to 10 K and the other 
parameters, namely 𝐽, 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓, and 𝑇𝐷, staying constant. For 
comparisons , we assume an idealized Dy - alloy family  
correspondingly . For the light rare -earth alloy series, 𝐽 and 
𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 are taken to be  4.5 and 3.52 𝜇𝐵 respectively , 
corresponding to the Nd3+ ion. For the heavy rare -earth  alloy 
series, 𝐽 and 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 are taken to be 7.5 and 10 𝜇𝐵 respectively , 
corresponding to the Dy3+ ion. 𝑇𝐷 of the light rare -earth alloy 
series is  assumed to be  352 K, which corresponds to  Laves 
phase  LaAl 2 [75]. For the heavy rare -earth  alloy  series , 𝑇𝐷 is 
assumed  to be  384 K, which corresponds to  Laves phase  
LuAl 2 [75]. Δ𝑆𝑇(𝑇,𝐻) and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑(𝑇,𝐻) can be calculated by 
Equation  (5). 
Figure 2 (a) shows the Δ𝑆𝑇(𝑇) of the Nd - alloy family, 
and the maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 of the Dy - alloy family  in magnetic 
fields of 5 T . In the temperature range of 77 ~ 20 K,  the 
maximum  Δ𝑆𝑇 of the light rare -earth alloy  series  are large.  
Especially in the vicinity of the condensation point of 
hydrogen (20 K), “giant” values are observe d, being almost 
two times  larger than those of the heavy rare -earth alloys  with 
a 𝑇𝐶 near room temperature . Figure 2 (b) shows the Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑(T) 
of the Nd - alloy family, and the maximum Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 of the Dy - 
alloy family  in magnetic fields of 5 T . Near 20 K,  the light 
rare-earth alloy series  shows a considerable maximum Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑, 
which is larger than or comparable to  that of  the heavy rare -
earth alloys with a 𝑇𝐶 near room temperature . Both Δ𝑆𝑇 and 
Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 show  an increasing maximum value with a decreasing 
𝑇𝐶 in the temperature range of 77 ~ 20 K. As predicted by the 
calculations, we can see that the light rare -earth series also 
achieve a large Δ𝑆𝑇 and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 at low cryogenic temperatures , 
especially in the vicinity of the condensation point of 
hydrogen.  
The calc ulations above point out a way of designing a 
fully light rare -earth  based magnetocaloric materials for 
hydrogen liquefaction: tune the 𝑇𝐶 down to 20 K. Though 
there are no such idealized alloy families where only 𝑇𝐶 varies, the chemical and physical similarities of the light rare -
earth elements, namely Ce, Pr, and Nd, makes it easy to tune 
the 𝑇𝐶 of their alloys by mixing different rare -earth elements 
with different  de Gennes factors on the rare -earth sublattices  
[76–78], as 𝑇𝐶 of rare -earth  based alloys usually scales with 
de Gennes factor following the equation  
 𝑇𝐶= 2𝑍𝒥𝐺
3𝑘𝐵 , (6) 
where Z is the nearest neighbors, 𝒥 is the Heisenberg 
exchange constant,  and G is the de Gennes  factor  [47].  
It has been reported that Laves phase s NdAl 2 with a 𝑇𝐶 
near 77 K and PrAl 2 with a 𝑇𝐶 near 30 K are two 
magnetocaloric materials with a large Δ𝑆𝑇 and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑[70]. 
However, these two compounds are unable to cover the full 
temperature range of 77 ~ 20 K. As s hown in Figure 1 (a), the 
de Gennes  factor of Nd, Pr, and Ce are significantly different, 
decreasing from 1.84 for Nd to 0.18 for Ce. Based on the 
analyses above, we predict that a light rare -earth RAl 2 (R: rare-
earth elements) Laves phase series that covers the full 
temperature range (77 ~ 20 K) required by magnetocaloric

 hydrogen liquefaction can be realized by tuning the 𝑇𝐶 via 
mixing Pr and Nd in (Nd,Pr)Al 2, and Pr and Ce in (Pr,Ce)Al 2. 
3. Experiment  
Polycrystalline Nd xPr1-xAl2 (x = 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25)  and Pr xCe1-
xAl2 (x = 1, 0.75, 0.5)  sample s were synthesized by arc melting 
high-purity elements Ce (99.5 at. %), Pr (99.5 at%), Nd (99.5 
at. %), and Al (99.998 at. %)  under Ar atmosphere . We did not 
synth esize Pr0.25Ce0.75Al2 and CeAl 2 since the later 
magnetization measurements show that the transition 
temperature of Pr 0.5Ce0.5Al2 is already below 20 K. To ensure 
good homogeneity, all the samples were melted three  times. 
The ingots were turned upside down before each melting step. 
Evaporation of the rare -earth elements was negligible.  Powder 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at room 
temperat ure with an x -ray diffractometer (Stadi P, Stoe & Cie 
GmbH) equipped with a Ge[111] -Monochromator using Mo -
Kα-radiation in the Debye -Scherrer geometry. The XRD data 
were evaluated by Rietveld refinement with the FullProf 
software packages  [79]. Backscatter electron (BSE) images 
were collected with a Tescan Vega 3 scanning electron 
microscope  (SEM). A Physical Properties Measurement 
System (PPMS) from Quantum Design was used to measure 
the magnetization of the samples in magnetic fields up to 5 T. 
Heat capacity in magnetic fields of 0, 2, and 5 T was measured 
in the same PPMS with the 2 τ appro ach.  4. Results and discussions  
4.1 Phase characterization  
The Laves phases NdAl 2 and PrAl 2 crystallize in the MgCu 2 
cubic structure (space group: 227). Figure 3 (a) shows the 
XRD patterns of the (R 1,R2)Al 2 (R1: Nd, Pr, R 2: Pr, Ce) 
samples. Detailed Rietveld refinements are included in the 
supplementary. The Rietveld refinements confirm that 
(Nd,Pr)Al 2 and (Pr,Ce)Al 2 does not change their crystal 
structures with the variation of Nd, Pr, or Ce content. Phase 
fraction analyses demonstrate the high quality of all the 
samples since the impurities are undetectable. The lattice 
constants of (Nd,Pr)Al 2 and (P r,Ce)Al 2 samples are plotted in 
Figure 3 (b). The lattice constants increase almost linearly 
with increasing Pr content in (Nd,Pr)Al 2 series and increasing 
Ce content in (Pr, Ce)Al 2 series, respectively. This is coherent 
with the fact that CeAl 2 has the largest and NdAl 2 has the 
smallest lattice constant  [78]. The quality of all the samples is 
further confirmed by SEM imaging. Figure 3 (c) shows an 
example of the microscopy using BSE contrast, proving phase 
purity of the Pr 0.75Ce0.25Al2 sample.  
4.2 Paramagnetic Curie temperature  
Figure 4 (a) plots the magnetization measurements of the 
Laves phases (R1,R2)Al 2 (R1: Nd, Pr, R 2: Pr, Ce) as a function 
of temperature  in magnetic fields of 5 T  to check the saturation 
magnetization . The samples were firstly cooled down to 7 K 
in magnetic fields of  5 T, and then heated up with their 
Figure 3 (a) XRD patterns of the Laves phases (R1,R2)Al 2 (R1: Nd, Pr, R 2: Pr, Ce)  measured at room temperature. (b) Lattice constants of all the samples given 
by Rietveld refinement. The red dashed line is the linear fitting for (Nd, Pr)Al 2 samples, and the black line dashed line is the linear fitting for (Pr, Ce)Al 2 
samples. (c) BSE image of Pr 0.75Ce0.25Al2. The black dots are holes.  Journal XX (XXXX) XXXXXX  W. Liu et al

 magnetization measured  in parallel . Under the same cooling 
and heating procedures, m agnetizatio n measurements in 0.1 T 
were done, the results  are included in the supplementary.  The 
saturated magnetization at 7 K of (Nd,Pr)Al 2 and 
Pr0.75Ce0.25Al2 samples is rather close, in the range between 64 
and 71 Am2/kg.  Pr0.5Ce0.5Al2 is the only exception having a 
significantly lower magnetization of around 40 Am2/kg.  
Figure 4 (b) shows the Curie -Weiss fits of all the 
samples in magnetic fields of 1 T. To reduce the deviation of 
the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility from the Curie -Weiss 
behavior, which may be associated with intrinsic factors such 
as the van Vleck effect, or extrinsic factors such as impurities  
[80–82], we performed the Curie -Weiss fit i n 1 T. The 
paramagnetic Curie temperature can be determined by the 
intercepts of the Curie -Weiss fit with the x -axis [45]. The total 
effective magnetic moment 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 can be calculated by  
 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓=1
𝜇𝐵  √3𝑘𝐵𝑀𝑅
𝑁𝐴𝛼  , (7) 
where 𝑀𝑅 is the molecular mass, 𝑁𝐴 the Avogadro constant, 
and 𝛼 the slope of the linear fitting for 𝜇0𝜒−1 𝑣𝑠.  𝑇 [45].  
Figure 4 (c) plots the 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 of all the samples. The total 
effective magnetic moment 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 of (Nd,Pr)Al 2 increases 
roughly linearly with Pr content, whereas 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 of (Pr,Ce)Al 2 decreases with  increasing Ce content. This observation can be 
explained by the fact that Pr3+ has the largest magnetic 
moment of 3.58 𝜇𝐵 and Ce3+ has the smallest magnetic 
moment of 2.54 𝜇𝐵 among the three light rare -earth ions.  
Figure 4 (d) plots the paramagnetic Curie temperature 
𝜃𝑝 and the de Gennes  factor 𝐺 of all the samples. The 
paramagnetic Curie temperature of (Nd,Pr)Al 2 decreases 
almost linearly with increasing Pr content, from 78.5 K for 
NdAl 2 to 32. 6 K for PrAl 2 , and it is the same case with 
(Pr,Ce)Al 2, from 32. 6 K for PrAl 2 to 13. 2 K for Pr 0.5Ce0.5Al2. 
This agrees  with the decreasing  trend of  the de Gennes  factor 
from NdAl 2 to Pr 0.5Ce0.5Al2 since as Equation (6) indicates, 
smaller de Gennes  factor, lower Curie temperatu re. The 
paramagnetic Curie temperature is in good agreement with the 
values of the Curie temperatures of NdAl 2 and PrAl 2 given by 
Ref. [70]. The reported Curie temperature for NdAl 2 varies 
from 65 to 82 K, and that for PrAl 2 varies from 31 to 38.5 K 
[70, 78, 83 –85]. 
In conclusion, by tuning de Gennes  factors via mixing 
different rare -earth elements, a fully light rare -earth  based 
magnetocaloric material  system  with a paramagnetic Curie

 4.3 Magnetocaloric effect  
According to the theoretical calculations above, the maximum  
Δ𝑆𝑇  of the light rare -earth  based magnetocaloric materials are 
expected to be large in the vicinity of the condensation point 
of hydrogen (20 K). Figure 5 (a) ~ (g) plot the Δ𝑆𝑇 of all the 
samples  in magnetic fields  of 2 and 5 T. Δ𝑆𝑇(𝑇,Δ𝐻) is 
determined by two methods: (1) heat capacity measurement s 
under constant applied field s via the thermodynamic equation 
𝑆(𝑇,Δ𝐻)−𝑆(𝑇,0)=∫𝐶𝑝(𝑇,Δ𝐻)−𝐶𝑝(𝑇,0)
𝑇𝑇
0𝑑𝑇  (𝐶𝑝 is the 
isobaric heat capacity ) [73, 86] , (2) magnetization vs. fields 
measurement s via the Maxwell relation Δ𝑆𝑇(𝑇,Δ𝐻)=
 ∫𝜕𝑀(𝐻,𝑇)
𝜕𝑇 𝑑𝐻𝐻1
𝐻0 [37, 87, 88] . An example  of how the Δ𝑆𝑇 is 
calculated by these two methods for PrAl 2 is included in the 
supplementary. Both methods fit well, as the points of the Δ𝑆𝑇 
from magnetization measurements mostly lie on the lines of  
the Δ𝑆𝑇 from heat capacity measurements. Besides, the 
temperature s where Δ𝑆𝑇 peaks are close to the paramagnetic 
Curie temperatures , consiste nt with the feature that second -
order magnetocaloric materials  show a ma ximum Δ𝑆𝑇 near 
their Curie temperature s [36, 65] . In agreement with the calculations in Figure 2 (a) above, 
the maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 increases from 7.21 J kg-1 K-1 for NdAl 2 to 
18.53 J kg-1 K-1 for Pr 0.75Ce0.25Al2 in magnetic fields of 5 T, 
and from 3.67 J kg-1 K-1 for NdAl 2 to 10.48 J kg-1 K-1 for 
Pr0.75Ce0.25Al2 in magnetic fields of 2 T. We observe an 
exception in this material series that Pr 0.5Ce0.5Al2 has a smaller  
maximum  Δ𝑆𝑇 than that of PrAl 2 and Pr 0.75Ce0.25Al2. Similar 
observations were reported in RNi 2 (R: Gd, Tb , Dy, Ho, Er)  
[45, 71]  and RAl 2 (R: Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm)  [72] series. 
One contribution to this decrease is the reduction of the 
effective magnetic moment 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓. As revealed in Figure 4 (c), 
Pr0.5Ce0.5Al2 has the lowest 𝜇𝑒𝑓𝑓 in the series. Another 
contribution might be due to the fact that crystalline electric 
field has a considerable  influence on the magnetocaloric effect 
in low temperatures  [45]. In the case of Pr 0.5Ce0.5Al2, the 
crystalline electric field may decrease the magnetic entropy 
change. However, this speculation needs to be val idated.  
Figure 5 (h) and ( i) compares the maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 of the 
light rare -earth RAl 2 series in this work to some of the other 
light rare -earth magnetocaloric materials  [89–94] and the 
heavy rare -earth RAl 2 (R: Tb, Dy, Ho, Er)  and Tb xHo 1-xNi2 (x 
= 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)  series  [45, 95, 96] . Form the plot s, we see

 that the light rare -earth RAl 2 series is highly competitive  
compared to the other light rare -earth magnetocaloric 
materials. Pr0.75Ce0.25Al2 exhibits  the largest maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 
among all  the light rare -earth magnetocaloric materials in 
Figure 5 (h) and (i) . The rest light rare -earth RAl 2 samples 
show a maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 that is larger than or comparable to the 
other light rare -earth compounds with a similar ordering 
temperature  (except PrSi which shows a Δ𝑆𝑇 larger than PrAl 2 
and Pr 0.75Nd 0.25Al2 samples).  
Although the heavy rare -earth series RAl 2 (R: Tb, Dy, 
Ho, Er) shows an obvious larger maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 than their 
light rare -earth counterparts in the vicinity of their ordering  
temperatures, the light rare -earth RAl 2 series  exhibits large  
Δ𝑆𝑇 near hydrogen condensation point (20 K), with 
Pr0.75Ce0.25Al2 having a larger Δ𝑆𝑇 than DyAl 2, and PrAl 2 
having a significantly larger Δ𝑆𝑇 than TbAl 2. Compar ed to 
other heavy rare -earth Laves phases such as Tb xHo xNi2 (x = 
0.25, 0.5, 0.75 , 1) [45, 95, 96] ,  Pr0.75Ce0.25Al2, PrAl 2 and 
Pr0.75Nd 0.25Al2 show a maximum Δ𝑆𝑇 that is larger than or 
comparative to that of Tb xHo 1-xNi2.  
Adiabatic temperature change Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 is as important as  
Δ𝑆𝑇 for magnetocaloric effect. Figure 6 (a)~(g) plot the Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑  
of the light rare -earth RAl 2 samples determined by  equation (5) via constructing the 𝑆(𝐻,𝑇) curves from the heat  capacity 
measurement s in magnetic fields of  0, 2, and 5 T . In agreement 
with the theoretical calculations above, the maximum Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 of 
the light rare -earth  RAl 2 series  is large in the vicinity of the 
condensation point of hydrogen (20 K), with all the three 
(Pr,Ce)Al 2 samples showing a maximum Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 over 2 K in 
magnetic fields of 2  T. In 5 T, all the three (Pr,Ce)Al 2 samples 
have  a maximum adiabatic temperature change over 4 K, and 
Pr0.75Ce0.25Al2 even shows a value close to 5 K. Figure 6 
(h)~(i) compares the  maximum  Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 of the light - and heavy 
rare-earth RAl 2, and the Laves phases Tb xHo 1-xNi2. The light 
rare-earth RAl 2 shows a  maximum  Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 which is about 1/3 ~ 
1/2 of the maximum values of the heavy rare -earth RAl 2 in the 
vicinity of  their ordering  temperature s. Compared to TbxHo 1-
xNi2 [45, 95, 96]  in magnetic fields of 2 T , PrAl 2 and 
Pr0.75Nd 0.25Al2 show a maximum Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 that is about half of the 
values of HoNi 2 and Tb 0.25Ho0.75Ni2, but comparative to that 
of Tb0.5Ho 0.5Ni2 and Tb0.75Ho 0.25Ni2. 
In summary, the light rare -earth RAl 2 alloy series show s 
a large Δ𝑆𝑇 being comparable to the other light rare -earth  
based materials in Figure 5 (h) and (i).  Both  of their  Δ𝑆𝑇 and 
Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 show a large maximum value  near 20  K. Despite 
showing a smaller Δ𝑆𝑇 and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑 than their heavy rare -earth

 counterparts in the vicinity of their  ordering temperatures , we 
see a high potential of the light rare -earth  RAl 2 series  for 
magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction, especially near 20 K, 
the condensation point of hydrogen.   
5. Conclusion s 
The relatively high abundance of light rare -earth 
elements in the earth’s crust makes their alloys appealing for  
magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction on an industrial scale. 
In this work, we aim ed at designing a fully light rare -earth  
based magnetocaloric material system covering the full 
temperature range from 77 to 20 K required by hydrogen 
liquefaction.  
In order to formulate a  strategy  for alloy design, the 
mean -field approach shown in our prev ious work is further 
developed to be applied to the light rare -earth alloys. From the 
theoretical analysis, we see that if 𝑇𝐶 of a light rare -earth  
based magnetocaloric material is tuned towards lower 
cryogenic temperature, the magnetocaloric effect is supposed 
to become stronger. Especially in the vicinity of the 
condensation point of hydrogen, the mean -field approach 
predicts significantly large Δ𝑆𝑇 and Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑. Based on these 
observations and taking the chemical and physical similarities 
of the light  rare-earth elements, a design strategy for  
developing  light rare -earth  material series  for hydrogen 
liquefaction  is used : tune the 𝑇𝐶 by mixing the light rare -earth 
elements with different de Gennes factors.  
Consequently , a light rare -earth  RAl 2 Laves  phase series  
with the ordering temperatures  covering the temperature range 
from 77 to 20 K  is successfully developed . This material s eries  
exhibits large Δ𝑆𝑇. Especially near  20 K  (condensation point 
of hydrogen ), the (Prx,Ce1−x)Al2 (x = 0, 0.75, 0.5)  samples 
show a Δ𝑆𝑇 that is larger than or  comparable to  that of  DyAl 2, 
a heavy rare-earth  based magnetocaloric material which is 
often proposed to be used in an active regenerator for 
hydrogen liquefaction  [32]. Large Δ𝑇𝑎𝑑  in the vicinity of 20 
K are achieved in the (Pr1−xCex)Al2 (x = 0, 0.75, 0.5 ) 
samples , which show a value that is more than two third of 
that of DyAl 2.  
This design strategy for  designing  the light rare -earth 
RAl 2 Laves phase series  for magnetocaloric hydrogen 
liquefaction may be applied to other light rare -earth alloys to 
tailor the ir magnetocaloric effects for the liquef action of  
industrial gases, inclusive but not limited to hydrogen gas.  In 
addition, our work is also helpful for designing 
magnetocaloric composite s, since tuning the Curie 
temperature  in layered structures with a cons tant Δ𝑆𝑇 over a 
wide temperature range is important for applications  [60, 62] .
