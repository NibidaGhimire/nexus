Abstract. Recently, the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray satellite has detected six Giant Molecular
Clouds (GMCs) located in the Gould Belt and the Aquila Rift regions. In half of these objects
(Taurus, Orion A, Orion B), the observed gamma-ray spectrum can be explained using the
Galactic diffused Cosmic Ray (CR) interactions with the gas environments. In the remaining
three GMCs (Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, Cepheus), the origin of the gamma-ray spectrum is still
not well established. We use the GEometry ANd Tracking (GEANT4) simulation framework
in order to simulate gamma-ray emission due to CR/GMC interaction in these three objects,
taking into account the gas density distribution inside the GMCs. We find that propagation
of diffused Galactic CRs inside these GMCs can explain the Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray
spectra. Further, our estimated TeV-PeV fluxes are consistent with the HAWC upper limits,
available for the Aquila Rift GMC. As last step, we compute the total neutrino flux estimated
for these GMCs and compare it with the IceCube detection sensitivity.

1 Introduction
Cosmic Rays (CRs) are relativistic particles, mainly protons and ions, that fill our Galaxy.
Their spectrum spans from some MeV to 1020eV with a Galactic component contributing at
least up to ∼3×1015eV or 3 PeV [1]. The transition energy where the source class changes
from Galactic to extra-galactic is still debatable, and it is expected to be in between 1017
to 1019eV [1]. SNRs are one of the most plausible sources of Galactic CRs, mainly because
they can supply the required energy budget for Galactic CRs (GCRs) and are the perfect
environment for first-order Fermi acceleration mechanisms. One of the main channels to
confirm CR origin is non-thermal High Energy (HE) gamma-ray emission that, however, can
be produced both by electrons, via Bremsstrahlung or Inverse Compton (leptonic processes),
and by protons, via p−pinteractions (hadronic processes). The necessary but not sufficient
condition for a source to be a CR accelerator is gamma-ray emission above 100 TeV (corre-
sponding to a particle of PeV energies) but in all known SNRs, a cutoff or break has been
observed at E < 100 TeV [2], which makes them less optimistic candidates for PeVatrons.
Binary systems in our Galaxy can inject CR particles above PeV via magnetic induction,
but they do not provide a sufficient energy budget to explain the observed CR flux on Earth
[3–5]. As per the population of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries, [6] found that the
contribution of these objects to the TeV CR spectra is 50 % and the contribution in the PeV
regime is still uncertain. Massive stars and pulsar wind nebula can be other prototype Galac-
tic sources of CRs [7, 8]. Investigations of all these Galactic sources provide us with unique
opportunities to study and reveal their capability as potential CR accelerators. One of the
main problems is that gamma-ray emission above 100 TeV could be due both to electrons and
– 1 –protons, consequently, this is not a sufficient condition to define a source as CR accelerator.
In this context, the operation of neutrino detectors becomes fundamental. Neutrino detection
from Galactic sources is the key to revealing CR sources because neutrinos are produced only
by hadronic processes (CR interaction with target material). Multi-messenger observations
and modelling of Galactic sources are important to identify potential CR sources [9–15]. So
far there are no confirmed detection of neutrino events from Galactic sources [16] because of
the low sensitivity of current detectors but with the future IceCube-Gen2 [17] the detection
statistics will be enhanced.
One of the main chances to detect hadronic gamma-ray emission at E > 100 TeV are
Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) that provide us with a laboratory to investigate CRs due
to their large gas density environments. Indeed, their very high-density value enhances the
interaction probability of CRs with the target material, and their multi-messenger observa-
tions can be used to identify any nearby CR accelerator and to analyse and understand CR
transport in the Galactic environments [18]. Sources like MAGIC J1837-073 [19], SNR W28
[20, 21], and SNR G35.6–0.4 [22] are some of the examples where Molecular Cloud (MC)
association with a CR source has been identified. Moreover, the gamma-ray emission from
isolated MCs are useful for studying the nature of the diffused spectrum of CRs at various
locations in the Galaxy [23, 24].
In this work, we focus on the interaction of the diffuse component of GCRs with some
local isolated GMCs (listed in Table 1) and we investigate how gas distributions affect the
produced gamma-ray emission. Re-accelerated particles could also affect the spectral shape of
the observed gamma-rays from the MCs [25], but we ignore these effects here. Our starting
point is the recent work by [26] where they analysed the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray spectra
detected from six nearby GMCs, it was found that the computed gamma-ray spectra in
some of them cannot be interpreted using AMS-like spectrum and additional CR sources are
required to interpret the excess. In their analysis, they use an analytical model assuming a
constant gas density in the whole cloud. Nevertheless, they postulated that several 100 T-
Tauri stars in GMC environments could inject an extra component of CRs that, interacting
with the gas medium, can produce additional gamma rays. In our work, we not only consider
the impact on the π0decay gamma-ray flux due to primary diffused GCRs but also include
the additional contribution due to the secondary CR nuclei produced inside the GMCs. Their
total contribution towards π0decay gamma-rays is calculated using GEometry ANd Tracking
(GEANT4) simulation. Further, we have selected a gas distribution model for the GMCs by
assuming their spherical morphology.
The outline of this paper is the following. In Section 2, we describe the properties of the
three GMCs analysed (Rho Oph, Aquila Rift and Cepheus) and their known observations.
In Section 3 We describe the CR spectrum, gas density model of GMCs and propagation
of CRs through this gas distribution and production of secondary particles using GEANT4
simulation. We further, discuss our results in Section 4 and conclude it in Section 5.
2 Gamma-ray Excess from Local GMCs
In [26], the authors analysed the gamma-ray spectra of six nearby GMCs detected by Fermi-
LAT i.e., Aquila Rift, Taurus, Rho Oph, Orion A, Cepheus, and Orion B. Their spectrum
follows a power-law in the range, 3 GeV - 1 TeV and they try to fit it using GCR interactions
with the gas density available inside these GMCs. They have used a constant gas-density
model and the value of the CR injection is the same used to analyse the GCR proton distri-
– 2 –bution measured by Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) [27]. The observed gamma-ray
spectral distribution from Taurus, Orion A, and Orion B GMCs agreed well with their model
but it significantly differs both in the spectral index and total flux for the remaining three
objects, Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, and Cepheus. In Rho Oph, Aquila Rift, and Cepheus GMCs,
the gamma-ray spectra cannot be explained by pion-decay model, if the CRs injected inside
GMCs are based on the detection by AMS-02 experiment [26].
In this work, our primary interest is the comprehension of the origin of this gamma-ray
excess reported by Fermi-LAT in these three GMCs. The main features of these objects will
be discussed in the following subsections, but the relevant information is listed in Table 1,
where their coordinates are tabulated in the second and third columns. The GMC radius
is calculated from their apparent angular area. The mass is calculated from the factor
A=M5/D2
kpc, where M5=M/105M⊙andM⊙is the Solar Mass, computed using data from
the observation of Planck dust opacity map at 353 GHz [28]. The systematic uncertainty
associated with the calculated mass (14%) comes from the observations [26, 28]. Since the
gamma-ray flux from the GMCs is directly proportional to M/D2times the incident GCR
flux [29], accurate measurements of the mass (M) and distance (D) of the GMCs are crucial.
The value of M/D2for the Aquila Rift is higher than that of the other GMCs, as shown
in Table 1, and as a result, the observed gamma-rays on Earth from this GMC is larger
compared to other two objects.

Area are taken from [26], and the remaining parameters are derived.
2.1 Rho Oph
The Rho Oph MC is a region in the constellation Ophiucus and is composed of gas and dust
grains. It is one of the nearest star-forming regions, located at a distance ∼125 pc covering
an angular area of 24 degree2in the sky. The total mass of the cloud is ∼6.22×103M⊙.
This GMC is an active star-forming region and more than hundreds of young T-Tauri stars
were observed inside it [30]. These stars are typically pre-main-sequence stars younger than
10 million years, with strong stellar winds, powerful magnetic fields and frequent flares [31].
The gamma-ray emission in the cloud region has been well studied by several space- and
ground-based gamma-ray detectors like COS-B [32], Fermi-LAT [26, 33], and HAWC [24].
Owing to the observation, several authors claimed a gamma-ray excess in correspondence of
the cloud [24, 26, 34] and the work by [26] concluded that this excess should come from the
several hundreds of young T-Tauri stars contained within the clouds. However, they admit
that the energy released from those stars is less than that necessary to explain the detected
gamma-ray flux, hence a contribution from other sources is required to explain the excess.
In addition, radio and X-ray observations [34] didn’t find any strong source near the cloud
core that could contribute to the excess, and the scenario remains still not well understood.
– 3 –2.2 Aquila Rift
Aquila Rift is another dense MC located very close to the Galactic plane and spanning
through the constellation of Aquila andSerpens . Its total mass is ∼8.11×104M⊙and it
is located at a distance of ∼225 pc with an angular area of 104 degree2. For this object,
Fermi-LAT observations in the energy range 3 – 1000 GeV [26] and HAWC upper limits in
the energy range 1 – 100 TeV are available [24]. The observation revealed that the expected
limits on the gamma-ray flux observed by the HAWC at 95% confidence level are about
ten times higher than the expected gamma-ray flux. The gamma-ray excess detected from
the Aquila Rift region cannot be explained by star-forming regions located inside the cloud
because most of them are excluded from the analysis template of Fermi-LAT observation
[26]. The gamma-ray observations are available for this object from GeV to PeV range and,
consequently, we extend our calculations to PeV energies for this object.
2.3 Cepheus
Cepheus is another MC located very close to the Galactic plane. This cloud, situated in the
constellation of Cepheus at a distance of ∼860 pc, is the largest among the three GMCs
studied in this work with a radius of ∼45.6 pc. Its mass is around ∼2.76×105M⊙. The
diffuse emission of gamma-rays from this region also shows a clear excess as calculated by
[26]. Its gamma-ray spectrum shows slightly steeper flux levels compared to the other two
objects discussed above [26]. The origin of gamma-ray excess could be due to the injection
of CRs by stellar winds as expected for this source [26]. In the vicinity of this object, three
OB-association are present [35]. However, in this work, we have not included the injection
of these CRs inside Cepheus cloud, and only diffuse GCR propagation is investigated.
3 Interactions of Galactic Diffused CRs with GMCs using GEANT4
GEANT4 is a Monte Carlo toolkit to simulate the interactions of particles with matter [36]. It
is a very versatile tool that is widely used in many different fields of physics including nuclear
physics, medical sciences, detector development, etc. Here, we have used this toolkit to
simulate the gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes from local GMCs, taking into account a realistic
three-dimensional mass model of the MC, physical interaction cross-sections, and primary
GCR Local Interstellar Spectrum (LIS). Figure 1 shows a simplistic flow chart diagram of
the simulation framework, and different models used in the simulation are described below.
3.1 GMC Geometry Model
The inherent properties of MCs, such as mass, radius, composition, etc., have a significant
impact on the gamma-ray fluxes produced in them. Consequently, we need an accurate model
of the cloud. In the simulation, the GMCs were constructed using five spherical concentric
shells (Figure 2), each of which is composed of neutral hydrogen ( H2) molecules. We assume
a gas temperature of ∼10 K, at which most of the gas molecules will be in the neutral state.
Inside the GMC, the gas density variation with radius R, i.e., nH2(R), can be approximated
using the relation [37]
nH2(R) =n0
1 + R
R0η, (3.1)
where n0is the density of the molecular hydrogen at the central core of the cloud, and
R0is the radius of the central core. In this simulation, we fixed R0= 0.5 pc. The number

for the Taurus cloud to reproduce the gamma-ray flux of [26] and corresponding plot is shown in the
Appendix B.
density of hydrogen molecules in each shell of different GMCs is chosen in such a way that the
total mass of every GMC reflects the total mass listed in Table 1 and is different for individual
clouds due to differences in their total mass and radius. The variation of gas densities in
each GMC shell is shown in Figure 2, where the density is calculated at R= (R1+R2)/2,
where R1andR2are inner and outer radii of the shells.
The parameter η(0≤η≤2) basically controls how rapidly the density of the clouds
falls [37]. Therefore, a GMC with a higher value of ηhas a higher value of molecular density
in its central region and a lower value of density in its outer region, compared to the same
GMC with a lower value of η. Due to this fact, the value of ηhas a significant effect on the
– 5 –gamma-ray flux coming from the GMC core but can not effectively modify the flux from the
whole GMC, as pointed out by [37]. In this work, the simulations were carried out for two
cases with η= 1 and η= 2, but here we have shown the analyzed results only for the value
ofη= 2 because the obtained gamma-ray fluxes are very similar in the two cases (see Figure
A.1 in the Appendix). We don’t consider the η= 0 scenario here to save the computation
time and also the constant density case is already discussed by [26].
3.2 Physical Interaction Models
In GEANT4 a lot of different physical interaction models are available through a set of
physics lists which handles the particle interactions and decay channels [38]. Depending on
the types and energy of the projectile particles and target materials, the type of interac-
tions can vary. Typically, the electromagnetic physics lists include the Photoelectric effect,
Compton scattering, Gamma conversion, Rayleigh scattering, Coulomb scattering, Pair pro-
duction, Ionisation, Bremsstrahlung, Annihilation, etc. The hadronic physics lists include
different types of Elastic/Inelastic scattering, Capture, and Fission processes. For the current
simulation purpose, the p−pinelastic interaction up to very high energy is highly important.
This interaction produces π0that eventually decays into two gamma-rays. In this simulation,
we used EmStandardPhysics option4 [39] from the available physics lists in GEANT4, which
can handle electromagnetic interactions up to PeV energies. However, none of the physics
lists available in GEANT4 can simulate hadronic interaction above 100 TeV. Consequently,
in order to simulate the hadronic interaction at E > 100 TeV, we used the GEANT4-CRMC
interfacing [40]. The implementation of this interface utilizes the GEANT4 inbuilt hadronic
physics list FTFP BERT [41] up to ∼10 TeV and then switches to QGSJETII-04 physics
list [42] which is valid up to ∼10 PeV.
3.3 Primary Particle Generation Model
The GCRs are omnipresent in our Galaxy and are considered to be isotropically distributed in
local ISM. In 2012, the Voyager 1 spacecraft made the first-ever observation of the distribution
of unmodulated CRs in the local ISM [43]. Combined with the observation of AMS-02 [27]
and PAMELA [44] space-based CR detectors a new form of primary GCR LIS was proposed
by [50] as shown in Equation 3.2.

where N is the normalization factor (2.7 Particles m−2sr−1s−1MeV−1for proton), E is the
kinetic energy (in GeV) of the particle, βis particle velocity/speed of light, and αis the
spectral index (3.93 for proton).
The distribution of primary GCR protons measured by various space-based detectors
is shown in Figure 3, along with the calculated LIS. Though the primary GCR is mainly
composed of protons, it also contains a small percentage of alpha particles and other heavy
elements (HZ). In order to find out the gamma-ray emission from the interaction of alpha and
heavy elements we also simulated the interaction of primary GCR alpha particles with the
GMCs including an extra contribution of 0.3 fraction added to the primary alpha nucleon
flux due to other HZ elements [51, 52]. We used the spectral distribution for the alpha
particles described in Equation 3.2 — modifying the parameters — with α= 3.89, and
the normalization factor divided by the nucleon number of alpha particles. The material

distributions in the GMCs are then irradiated by the primary particles using the above-
mentioned energy distributions in the kinetic energy range of 10−1– 107GeV from a spherical
surface surrounding the GMC geometry. The angular distribution of the particle momenta
is done using the cosine-law to ensure the isotropic irradiance of the molecular clouds [53].
The entire input energy spectrum was divided into four energy intervals (10−1–101–103–105–
107GeV) in order to maintain better simulation statistics at the high energy end where
particle flux is lower. We simulated ∼8×108incident particles in the whole energy range,
i.e.,∼2×108particles in each energy interval. We need to normalize the emitted gamma-
ray luminosity (ΦS
γ) from the simulation with a normalization factor ( NF) to compare the
simulation results to the observed one. Thus the normalized gamma-ray luminosity at the
GMC location (ΦGMC
γ) [54–56] is given by

over the considered energy range, the area of the surface generating the particles, and the
solid angle of the angular distribution.

Now, to compare the normalized gamma-ray luminosity (ΦGMC

4 Results and Discussion
The total gamma-ray flux produced from the interaction of primary GCR protons with each
of the individual GMCs is displayed in Figure 4. The figure shows that a primary GCR
proton with an energy of 10 PeV can readily create a PeV gamma-ray from GMCs, where
the Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) for each GMC are quite similar both in terms of
spectral shape and intensity. This could be due to the fact that the GMCs are irradiated with
the same particle flux and comparable densities between their outer shells, with the exception
of Aquila Rift and Cepheus which have relatively few molecules per cubic centimetre. Because
of fewer target molecules available for interactions in their outer shells, the contribution of
these to the total gamma-ray flux is small relative to the high-density shells. The larger
error bars at around 102, 104, and 106GeV energy come from our choice to divide the whole
simulated energy range into four sub-energy ranges. The error bars are not exactly at the
incident energy divisions (i.e., 10−1–101–103–105–107GeV) because the secondary photons
get∼10% of the kinetic energy of primary protons in π0decay process.
From our simulation study, we have also shown that almost all of the gamma-rays
created in our energy range of interest (100 MeV to 10 PeV) are through the π0decay
process and that the contribution of Bremsstrahlung emission from the electrons generated
byp−pinteractions are insignificant. This is shown in Figure 4.
The contributions from the HZ elements in the total observed gamma-ray flux has
already been studied by several authors [57–61]. They found that a Nuclear Enhance Factor
(NEF) in the range of 1.45 to 2.1 (above GeVs) needs to be multiplied by the gamma-ray
flux produced from the primary GCR proton to find the total gamma-ray emission due to
all CR nuclei. It is generally used as an energy-independent constant factor, but it can vary
depending on the energy of incident particles. Using this simulation framework, we have also
tried to find out the NEF for heavy elements in hydrogen molecular targets. In Figure 5, the
total gamma-ray flux due to CR protons and also due to heavy nuclei is shown for Aquila
Rift GMC. [61] assumed hydrogen as the only target element and found the value of NEF
∼1.3 at CR energy 10 GeV/nucleon. Based on our simulation, we have found the average
NEF from the heavy elements in the energy range of Fermi-LAT observation (i.e., 3–1000
GeV) is ∼1.32. However, it should be noted that heavy elements present in the ISM also
contribute to the total gamma-ray flux. But this has not been considered in this simulation.
So, in order to include the effect of this contribution too, we consider a total NEF of 2.09,
as suggested by [58].

p−pprocess is accompanied by the emission of neutrinos. These neutrinos are mainly pro-
duced from the decay of charged pions and muons. For this reason, we expect the flavour
ratio at the position of the source to be νe:νµ:ντ= 1 : 2 : 0. However, due to the neutrino
oscillation, the flavour ratio at the observation location here on the Earth will be modified
intoνe:νµ:ντ≈1 : 1 : 1 [62]. In Figure 8, the sensitivity of the IceCube detector for 5 σ
discovery potential at the celestial equator over ten years of observation is shown (orange
line) along with the total simulated neutrino fluxes from the three GMCs. The total neutrino
fluxes shown here include both the contributions from νe,µ+ ¯νe,µ, but we do not find any
contributions from ντ+ ¯ντ. It is also evident from the figure that the current generation of
IceCube detectors is not sensitive enough to detect neutrino signals from GMCs. However,
the sensitivity of the proposed future-generation IceCube-Gen2 detectors (teal line) will be
sufficient enough to detect the signals from some of the large and nearby GMCs.
5 Summary and Conclusions
We have discussed the total gamma-ray and neutrino flux produced in three particular Galac-
tic GMCs through the interaction of GCRs. The gamma-ray spectrum estimated in this work
can explain the Fermi-LAT data for all GMCs quite satisfactorily. However, for the Rho Oph
and Aquila Rift GMCs the spectra are harder in between 30–100 GeV, and its origin might
be due to primary Proton/Helium particle spectra above ∼200 GeV [63, 64], which has
also been reported by [26]. Nevertheless, our model can explain the gamma-ray spectra
of Cepheus GMC quite well. Another probable origin of this hardening in the gamma-ray
spectra of GMCs could be due to CR re-acceleration in the vicinity of GMCs [25]. In the
future, we can study the impact of these physical scenarios by including them in the current
simulation framework.
Future observations with the next-generation Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Tele-
scopes, as ASTRI Mini-Array [65–69] or Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) [70, 71] would
be important to reveal any point source populations that can contribute to gamma-rays
above a few GeV from these GMCs. The estimated neutrino flux in this work for the GMCs
under consideration has been compared with the current IceCube sensitivity in Figure 8.

Cepheus MCs. The IceCube sensitivity is also shown for its first and second-generation (orange and
teal line) telescopes. [17].
The Aquila Rift source looks like a potential candidate for the second-generation IceCube
neutrino observatory, due to its larger mass and its relatively short distance (hence larger
– 11 –M/D2value) as given in Table 1. Its neutrino flux is comparable to the sensitivity of the
second-generation IceCube neutrino observatory in the range of 1–10 TeV.

A APPENDIX: Effect of ηon the Secondary Gamma-ray Flux
We have simulated the interaction of the primary GCR protons with Rho Oph GMC for two
different values of ηin Equation 3.1 to find out how the variation in density of each shell of
a GMC could modify the production of gamma-rays from the whole GMC. The simulated
gamma-ray fluxes, as shown in Figure A.1b, however, do not show any significant difference
for the two values of η. This is also mentioned in [37], that the change in the density profile
could not significantly modify the emission of gamma-rays from the whole cloud. This could
be due to similar densities in the outer shells of the GMCs (see Figure A.1a).
