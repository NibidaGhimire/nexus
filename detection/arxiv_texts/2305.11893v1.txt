Abstract
Exact solutions describing Rossby waves and vortices in oce an
propagating along the zonal direction at a constant velocit y are con-
sidered for the (3 + 1) -dimensional nonlinear Charney - Obuk hov
equation. In the ﬁrst part of our work, we give examples of sol utions
of the Charney-Obukhov equation that satisfy the nonlinear bound-
ary conditions of the ocean, for a special case that correspo nds to the
”separation” of variables.
In recent papers [1], [2], [3], exact solutions of the Charney–Obukho v
equation for the ocean were obtained in the form of synoptic-scale waves
and eddies against the background of a zonal ﬂow depending on the vertical
coordinate z. Thezonal ﬂowinthese solutionsisitself a solutiontotheChar-
ney–Obukhov equation, while waves and vortices are not. These so lutions
are of physical interest, since they demonstrate the inseparable connection
between the emerging motion of the ocean and the zonal ﬂow. It sh ould be
notedthat for solutions describing drift inthe zonal direction with a constant
velocityV, Charney–Obukhov equation can be reduced to solving a linear
Helmholtz-type equation. This reduction is well known in hydrodynam ics
and was used to obtain solutions in [1], [2], [3]. To describe the processe s in
theocean, theCharney–Obukhov equations aresupplemented wit hnonlinear
boundary conditions at the bottom and on the surface of the ocea n. Taking
into account the connection of the Charney-Obukhov equation wit h a linear
equation, the Charney–Obukhov equation itself without taking into account
the boundary conditions has a large set of solutions and a superpos ition of
solutions. An interesting property of the considered model is the p ossibility
of fulﬁlling nonlinear boundary conditions for a wide class of solutions o f the
1Charney-Obukhov equation. In the ﬁrst part of our work, we give exam-
ples of solutions of the Charney-Obukhov equation that satisfy th e nonlinear
boundary conditions of the ocean, for a special case that corres ponds to the
”separation” of variables.

equation. We consider the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear Charney–O bukhov
equation in the form

east, the y-coordinate is north, and the z-coordinate is up.
We consider for equation (1) the boundary conditions for an ocean with
a ﬂat bottom and a rigid lid. Such boundary conditions are often used
to model waves and vortices in the ocean, a detailed discussion of th ese
boundary conditions is given, for example, in the book [4]. The bounda ry
condition operator has the form

whereU(z;V) is the velocity of the steady zonal background ﬂow which
depends on the velocity V. Thus, the ﬁrst term of the formula (32) can
be represented as the product of the horizontal coordinate fun ction and the
vertical coordinate function, this is a case of ”separation” of var iables.
