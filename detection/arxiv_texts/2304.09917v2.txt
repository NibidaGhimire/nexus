In this paper, we consider a cosmological model in f(R, G) gravity in a flat space-time, where R
is the Ricci scalar and Gis the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The function f(R, G) is taken as a linear
combination of Rand an exponential function of G. We analyze the observational constraints under
a power law cosmology which depends on two physical parameters: the Hubble constant H0and
the deceleration parameter q. We constrain these two dependent parameters using the latest 77
points of the OHD data, 1048 points of the Pantheon data, and the joint data OHD+Pantheon
and compare the results with the ΛCDM. Also, we speculate constraints using a simulated data
set for the future JDEM (Joint Dark Energy Mission)/Omega, supernovae survey. We see that
H0is in very close agreement with some of the latest results from the Planck Collaboration that
assume the ΛCDM model. Our work in power law cosmology better fits the Pantheon data than
the earlier analysis [1, 2]. However, the constraints obtained on Haverage, < H 0>andqaverage,
< q > using the simulated data set for the future JDEM/Omega, supernovae survey are found to
be inconsistent with the values obtained from the OHD and the Pantheon data. Additionally, we
discuss statefinder diagnostics and see that the power law models approach the standard ΛCDM
model ( q→ − 1). This model satisfies the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics. Finally,
we conclude that the power law cosmology in f(R, G) gravity explains most of the distinguished
attributes of evolution in cosmology.

I. INTRODUCTION
Current standard observations including type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation, large scale structure (LSS), the Planck satellite, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the Wilkinson
microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP) provide strong evidence about the accelerated expansion of the universe. It
is noticed that modified gravity may describe the accelerated expansion of the universe in a better way. As we
know, the modified gravity model is a simple gravitational alternative to the dark energy model. The idea behind
these approaches to dark energy consists of adding additional gravitational terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action,
which changes the universe’s evolution in early or late times. Many examples of such models in modified gravity
abound in the literature [3–5]. During the inflationary era, the Universe expanded at an extremely rapid rate. The
inflationary era came to light during the late 70′sin the early 80′s, which solved some of the problems of the Big
Bang model. Bouncing cosmological models may be an acceptable description of the universe at early and late times
and fit observations. This can be described by modified gravity in a unified way. To explain the accelerated expansion
in standard general relativity, a phantom fluid or field is required. This phantom field eventually leads to a big rip,
i.e., to a crushing type of singularity. [6].

The late-time acceleration of the universe can also be described by modified gravity. If we replace the scalar
curvature Rin the Einstein-Hilbert action by f(R), where f(R) is arbitrary, then we get f(R) gravity. This theory
is simple, viable, and quite successful. There are many modifications of general relativity. If the Lagrangian is a
function of both Rand the trace Tof the energy momentum tensor, then we get f(R, T) theory [7–19]. The Tterm
is introduced to take into account quantum effects, viscosity, and heat conduction. The late-time cosmic acceleration
can also be explained in this gravity theory. f(R, T) gravity has been subjected to observational constraints. On the
other hand, an interesting alternative to f(R) gravity is f(R, G). Here Gis the Gauss-Bonnet invariant constructed
from the invariants RµνRµνandRµναζRµναζ, where Rµνis the Ricci tensor, and Rµναζ is the Riemann tensor. In the
literature, it is found that f(R, G) gravity is capable of describing inflation and late-time acceleration [20–34]. Here,
our main interest is to analyze the physical parameters of the universe in f(R, G) gravity.
The standard cosmological model has been incredibly successful in explaining the large-scale structure and history
of the universe. However, it still has a major mystery such as the cosmological constant problem. This means we
do not understand why the universe seems to be constantly expanding at an accelerating rate. Nevertheless, in the
literature, many different models explain the main fearures of the universe. Models based on a power-law of the scale
factor are quite successful in solving the age, horizon, and flatness problems that occur in the standard model [35–
42]. Sethi et al. discussed an open linear coasting cosmological model based on a power law model [43]. Shafer used
observation data and studied a robust model using a power law [44]. Some remarkable works on other types of modified
theories have been carried out by several authors. Recently, many excellent works have been accomplished by several
authors in the alternative theory of gravity [45–59]. Overall, power-law cosmology offers a promising alternative to
the standard model, potentially addressing some of its shortcomings. However, further research is needed to explore
its full implications.
The present work is organized as follows: In Sec.II, we evaluate the Einstein field equations for f(R, G) gravity
and using a power law cosmology, we have calculated the pressure and energy density in terms of the deceleration
parameter q. In Sec. III, we constrain the best-fit values of H0andqusing MCMC simulation. Also, we predict
constraints employing a simulated data set for the future JDEM, supernovae survey [60, 61] and perform Statefinder
analysis of the obtained results. In Sec. IV, we discuss the cosmological parameters one by one and also observe the
viability of the energy conditions. In the same section, the Statefinder and Omdiagnostics are studied. In Sec. V,
we measure the total entropy and Hawkings temperature for this model. And Finally, we summarize the outcomes of
the obtained model.
II. THE ACTION AND COSMOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS
A. Field Equations
The action of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity in four dimension space-time is: [6, 34]
S=Zf(R, G)
2κ√−gd4x+Sm, (1)
where κ= 8πG, and Smis the matter Lagrangian, which depends upon gµνand matter fields. The Gauss-Bonnet
invariant Gis defined as G=R2+RµναζRµναζ−4RµνRµν. The Gauss-Bonnet invariant is obtained from Rµναζ,
Rµν=Rζ
µζνandR=gαζRαζ. From the equation of action (1), the gravitational field equations are derived as

ν=κTm
µν,(2)
where Tm
ijis the energy momentum tensor arising from Sm. The flat FLRW space-time metric is:
ds2=−dt2+a2(t)(dx2+dy2+dz2), (3)
where the symbols have their usual meanings. Now, we calculate the Einstein field equations using Eqs. (2) and (3)
as:3
F(G) + 6H2−GF′(G) + 24 H3˙GF′′(G) = 2 κρ, (4)
6H2+ 4 ˙H+F(G) + 16 H˙G(˙H+H2)F′′(G)−GF′(G) + +8 H2¨GF′′(G) + 8 H2˙G2F′′′(G) = −2κp, (5)
Here H=˙a(t)
a(t)is the Hubble parameter and ˙ a(t)≡da
dt. Also, we have
R= 6(2 H2+˙H), (6)
G= 24H2(H2+˙H). (7)
In the present model, we are taking F(R, G) =R+αe−Gand this term denotes the difference with general relativity.
Here, αis an arbitrary positive constant and if α= 0 then it will return to GR theory.
B. Power law cosmology
To implement power-law cosmology, we take the scale factor a(t) as [1, 2]
a(t) =a0(t
t0)ζ, (8)
where a0is the value of a(t) at present, and ζis a parameter which is dimensionless. Now, the Hubble parameter can
be described using the scale factor as
H≡˙a
a=ζ
t. (9)
Also
H0=ζ
t0. (10)
Now, since we know the relation between the scale factor and redshift i.e. a(t) =a0
1+z, where zis the redshift, H
can be in terms of ( z) as
H(z) =H0(1 +z)1
ζ. (11)
To understand the history of the universe, we consider cosmological parameters like pressure, energy density, EoS
parameter, Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, etc. The acceleration or deceleration phase of the universe can
be measured by a dimensionless quantity which is known as the deceleration parameter. The deceleration parameter
qis defined as:
q=−¨a
aH2. (12)
Now if q >0, we have a decelerating universe, if q <0, then it indicates acceleration phase and if q= 0, then the
expansion will be at a constant rate. Eqs. (8), (9) and (12) yield
q=1
ζ−1. (13)
Thus, we represent the Hubble parameter in terms of deceleration parameter qand redshift as4
H(z) =H0(1 +z)(1+q). (14)
The energy density and the pressure can be obtained by solving Eqs. (4) and (5) which are given as
ρ=αe24H4

For further analysis, we take αandκequal to unity and constrain the model parameters H0andqusing recent
observational data sets.
III. OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS
In this section, observational data sets are used to constrain the value of H0andqwhich appear in the tilted
Hubble parametrization. In the present model, we use the H(z), Pantheon datasets, and their joint data set.
A. OHD Data set
Here, we use OHD (77 points) as compiled by Shaily [56]. Now, best-fit values of H0andqare obtained from the
usual chi-square test. Chi-square is given by:
χ2
HD(H0, q) =77X
i=1[H(H0, q, z i)−Hobs(zi)]2
σ2zi, (18)
where HobsandH(H0, q, z i) are the observed and theoretical values, respectively and σ(zi)is the standard deviation
atH(zi).
B. Pantheon Data set
We use Pantheon compilation, which consists of 1048 data points in the redshift range 0 .01< z < 2.26. This
data is collected from different supernovae survey e.g.CfA 1-4, CSP, SDSS, SNLS, PS1, and high-z in the redshift
range 0 .01≤z≤2.26 according as the Table I. The SNIa data plays a key role in investigating the expansion rate of
the universe [62].
We compute the value of distance modulus µth(zi) using the predicted apparent magnitude (m) and absolute
magnitude (M) w.r.t. the color and stretch as
µth(z) =−M+m=µ0+ 5 log DL(z), (19)
where DL(z) is the luminosity distance, and µ0is the nuisance parameter. These are given by:

C. Joint Data set (OHD+Pantheon)
By performing joint statistical analysis using H(z) and Pantheon data sets, we can obtain stronger constraints.
Therefore, the chi-square function for joint data sets can be written as

D. ΛCDM
In standard cosmology, the cosmological constant Λ known as ΛCDM is the simplest dark energy candidate whose
energy density remains constant w.r.t. time given by ρΛ≡Λ
8πG=−pΛ, and ωΛ=−1 is its equation of state (EoS).
The Hubble parameter for ΛCDM model for flat FLRW Universe is given by
H(z) =H0[Ωm0(1 +z)3+ (1−Ωm0)]1/2. (25)
Here, Ω m0andH0are the present matter density and Hubble parameter respectively.
E. JDEM: Simulated SNIa data
In addition, we use a simulated dataset based on the upcoming JDEM SN-Survey with around 2300 SNIa data
points in the redshift range from 0 ≤z≤1.7 to analyze our future accomplishment [60]. We consider a simplified7

error of σ= 0.13 magnitude, as expected from JDEM-like future surveys [61]. A set of 500 data points has been
generated using the latest specifications [78], taking ΛCDM model as our standard model with Ω m0= 0.3. The
best-fit parameters H0,q,r, and swere calculated using 500 data points. Finally, we computed the mean values of
H0,q,r, and sdenoted as < H 0>,< q > ,< r > , and < s > respectively [2]. The numerical results are given in
Table III.
IV. PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE MODEL
For a flat universe, we evaluate the best-fit values of H0andqfor the H(z), Pantheon, and their joint data
sets, respectively. For this purpose, we perform the coding in Python, where we use the Monte Carlo Markov chain
(MCMC) method which is given in the Python module emcee , and plot the 2-D plots with 1 −σ, 2−σlikelihood
contours. In Fig. 1, the contours are closed but are not in proper oval shape. The convergence of this type of plot8

Bayesian inference to examine the convergence of the profile [59, 79, 80]. For the H(z) data set, the best fit values
areH0= 68.119+0.028

the best fit values are H0= 70 .5+1.3

H0= 69.103+0.019
−0.10andq=−0.132+0.014
−0.014, which is observed in Fig. 1c. In our work, we notice that q0differs from is
not very close to -0.5, which is the approximate value for the ΛCDM model. In the refs [81, 82], it is pointed out that
modified gravity theories could admit different values for q0. We plot the error bar plots for the Hubble and SNIa
data sets with these best-fit values. In Fig. 2, one can compare the present model with the ΛCDM model.
A. Physical Parameters
This section analyzes the changing behavior of energy density ρand pressure p. From Eqs. (15) and (16), it is
clear that the values of ρandpare in the terms of zand the value of ωis in terms of qonly, i.e., a constant. So, to
understand the evolution of these parameters we plot the graphs. Fig. 3a shows the evolution of the energy density
against the redshift. For high redshift ρis very large, and as zdecreases, ρalso decreases for the whole range of z
ans as z→ −1, the energy density ρ→0. Further, Fig. 3b shows the evolution of pressure pagainst redshift z, and
we observe that the pressure is negative, corresponding to accelerated expansion. From Eqs. (15), (16) and (17), we
calculate the value of the EoS parameter which is almost constant from high redshift to low redshift. The numerical
values of ωare measured as -0.406, -0.5, -0.421 for the H(z), Pantheon and their joint data sets, respectively. These
EoS parameter values show that our model is in the quintessence region.9
B. Energy Conditions
The energy conditions (ECs) are relevant to study the issues related to the space-time singularity and the behavior
of the null, space-like, time-like, or light-like geodesics. These conditions are discussed as a simple constraint on the
linear combination of the energy density and the pressure. We study the energy conditions for the f(R, G) modified
gravity [34]. This results in energy density not being negative and that gravity always indicates an attractive force.
ECs always inflict restrictions on the capability of the stress tensor to contract at each location of the space [83].
These energy conditions can be expressed in the geometric form in addition to the physical form which complies
with the Ricci tensor as the stress tensor in the Einstein field equation for different theories of gravity. The ECs are
explained in terms of the weak energy condition (WEC), the strong energy condition (SEC), the dominant energy
condition (DEC), and the null energy condition (NEC), which are given in Table IV, where tiandξjare co-oriented
time-like vectors and kiis a null (light-like) vector. These conditions are dependent on each other [84].
TABLE IV: Energy Conditions
Energy Condition Physical form Geometric form Perfect Fluid form
NEC T ijkikj≥0 Rijkikj≥0 ρ+p≥0
WEC T ijtitj≥0 Gijtitj≥0 ρ≥0, ρ+p≥0
SEC (Tij−T
n−2gij)titj≥0 Rijtitj≥0 ρ+p≥0,(n−3)ρ+ (n−1)p≥0
DEC T ijtiξj≥0 Gijtiξj≥0 ρ≥ |p|
In Table IV, it is noted that if WEC, SEC, and DEC hold then NEC holds, but if the NEC does not satisfy then
none of the ECs can be satisfied [85]. It is reviewed that the NEC is the viable condition for all of the stable models of
the universe. In a sensible model, other ECs can be violated by adding a suitable (positive or negative) cosmological
constant. If the stress-energy tensor violates the NEC, the system becomes catastrophically unstable, meaning the
presence of the ghost system. This occurs when the system either with wrong sign of the kinetic term or the system
contains tachyons [86], which are in the modes that expand exponentially with arbitrarily short wavelengths. The
modified gravity theories deviating from general relativity can be viewed as having a background of a scalar field with
a stress-energy tensor and serving as a reasonably cosmological constant. In such theories, the NEC can be violated.
As a result, the modified gravity theories may affect degenerating dispersion relations, enabling the breaking of the
NEC.
The NEC plays a prominent role among different ECs studied in general relativity. In the NEC, the energy-
momentum tensor for matter Tijsatisfies Tijkikj,∀ki,i.e., for any vector with gijkikj= 0. The main reasons why
the NEC is contemplated significant [87], (i) It was previously believed that the NEC could only be violated in a
theory that involves a scalar field with non-minimal coupling to gravity [88], (ii) the NEC is a fundamental assumption
in the Penrose singularity theorem [89], which is applicable in general relativity. The Penrose singularity theorem is
based on two conditions: (i) the NEC be upheld; (ii) the Cauchy hypersurface be non-compact. This theorem states
that a trapped surface exists in space, and a singularity will eventually occur. The trapped surface is defined as a
closed surface where the outgoing light rays converge (moving inward).
In Fig. 4, it is demonstrated that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, but the SEC is violated, indicating the universe’s
accelerated expansion.
C. Cosmographic parameters
To understand the universe’s expansion history, many cosmological parameters are studied, which are expressed
in the form of higher-order derivatives of the scale factor. Therefore, to explore the dynamics of the universe, these
parameters are very helpful. For example, Hubble parameter Hshows the expansion rate of the universe, the
deceleration parameter qtells about the phase transition of the universe, the jerk parameter j, the snap parameter s,
and the lerk parameter minvestigate dark energy models and their dynamics. These are defined as:10

Here j,s,l, and mare known as the cosmographic parameters. Using the obtained best-fit value of q, we find that
the present value of j=−0.085238 ,−0.125,−0.097152 for the OHD, Pantheon and OHD+Pantheon data sets,
respectively.
D. Statefinder Diagnostic
In the literature, we find that to understand the universe’s dynamics, geometric parameters play a vital role. When
we study the deceleration parameter, we get information about the phase transition of the universe from deceleration
to acceleration or vice versa. Therefore, it is required to study some additional higher-order derivatives of scale factor
aliker. To distinguish various dark energy models, we use a statefinder diagnostic technique defined in a pair {r, s},11

andrparameters from the observed values of q. Fig. 5a shows the time evolution of the statefinder pair {r, s}for the
power-law cosmological model. The model converges to the fixed point ( r= 1, s= 0) which corresponds to ΛCDM.
The point ( r= 1, s= 2/3) corresponds to HDE. Fig. 5b shows the time evolution of the statefinder pair {r, q}for
the said model. The point ( r= 1, q= 0.5) corresponds to a matter-dominated Universe (SCDM) and converges to
the point ( r= 1, q=−1) which corresponds to the de Sitter expansion (SS). The dots shown on the curves by arrows
are the best-fit values of r,s, and qobtained by the latest OHD, Pantheon, and joint data (OHD+Pantheon). Here,
our model approaches the ΛCDM model as q→ −1 and is consistent with [2].
E. Om Diagnostic
Here, we use the Omdiagnostic technique known to compare our model with the ΛCDM model. This helps us
distinguish various dark energy models without calculating the energy density and the EoS parameter. The pattern
of the trajectories in the Omdiagnostic plot indicates the various dark energy models. The definition of the Om
diagnostic in terms of zis:
Om(z) ={H(z)
H0}2−1
z3+ 3z2+ 3z. (29)
The plots of the Omdiagnostic help us to explain the nature of dark energy models. We know that if the curvature is
positive z, then the model is a ghost dark energy model, if the curvature is negative concerning z, we have quintessence,
and if it has zero curvature, then the model represents the ΛCDM model. Fig. 6 shows that in late times, we have
quintessence since the curvature is negative w.r.t. z[91, 92].12

V. THERMODYNAMICAL STATUS OF THE MODEL
This section delves into applying the generalized second law of thermodynamics to our model. It is crucial to
recognize that thermodynamics posits the entropy of isolated systems cannot decrease. We explore the calculation
of the total entropy for this model, presuming that the apparent horizon is linked to temperature and entropy in a
manner analogous to the black hole event horizon. According to the law, it mandates that the total entropy includes
the entropy of all sources. As the Universe progresses, the rate of entropy change for both the contained fluid and
the horizon must either stay constant or increase. To calculate the entropy on the boundary, we imagine a kind of
spherical border around the universe, defined by its radius ( Rh). This radius is linked to the expansion rate of the
universe ( H), which we have written in equation (14) as [93–97]
Rh=1
H=1
H0(1 +z)(1+q). (30)
Now, we calculate the amount of entropy at the edge of the horizon using the formula
Son=πκbR2
h
l2p, (31)
where κbandlpare the notations used for Boltzmann constant and Planck’s length, respectively. Further, to investigate
the matter entropy inside the horizon, the Gibbs relation is used as
ThdSin=d(ρV) +pdV=V d(ρ) + (ρ+p)dV, (32)
where pandρhave been obtained from Eqs. (11) and (12) and the volume enclosed by the horizon is V=4π
3R3
h.
Here, This the Hawking temperature on the edge of the horizon and can be calculated as
Th=1
2πRh(1−˙Rh
2HRh). (33)
And, the condition for the second law of thermodynamics in thermodynamic equilibrium is as
˙Stot=˙Sin+˙Son≥0. (34)
To analyze the nature of total entropy and Hawkings temperature, a graphical representation has been applied by
using the above relations and the value of H,ρ, and p, we plot the trajectories for total entropy and Hawkings13

temperature (see Fig. 7). Fig. 7a illustrates that The combined rates of the entropy change for matter and the
horizon are always non-negative. Therefore, the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics is consistently satisfied
for a spatially flat FLRW universe with pressureless dark matter within the apparent horizon. Also, Fig. 7b depicts
that the Hawkings temperature decreases from early to late times.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
The exactness of the cosmological observations extends the possibility of revealing the crucial properties of the
Universe. In this work, the power-law cosmology stated in Eq. 8 contains some outstanding features, making
it different compared to the other models of the Universe. If we consider ζ≥1 in Eq. 8, then it directs the
horizon, flatness, and age problems [98–100], and all these features are viable to the power-law cosmology to solve the
cosmological constant problem analytically. In this work, we used the most recent observational data sets from OHD
and Pantheon observations compiled in Table I. We have obtained the constraints on two important cosmological
parameters H0andqand compared our results with the earlier work [1, 2]. Additionally, We have predicted these
constraints with simulated data for large future surveys like JDEM. The numerical results have been concluded in
Tables II, and III.
The late-time behaviour of our flat FLRW model in f(R, G) gravity has been studied, where F(R, G) =R+αe−G
and the invariant GisG=R2−4RµνRµν+RµναζRµναζ. Since the field equations are difficult to solve in general, we
assume a power law for the scale factor a. We constrain Handqusing recent observational datasets with the MCMC
methodology and then proceed to study the behavior of the obtained model and the universe’s evolution. The model
has exhibited a singularity that is of the point type. The volume increases as tincreases. The Hubble parameter
monotonically decreases as z→ −1. The model is expanding with constant acceleration. The energy density of the
model monotonically decreases with an increase in time, starting from infinity, and at late times, it tends to zero.
Fig. 3, shows that our model is a quintessence dark energy model for all observational datasets.
The deceleration parameter is considered a free model parameter and its present values are constrained as q=
−0.109+0.014
−0.014,q=−0.25+0.15
−0.15, and q=−0.132+0.014
−0.014using OHD, Pantheon, and OHD+Pantheon data sets, respec-
tively, which deviate from the present day best-fit values (see Fig. 1). The NEC and DEC energy conditions are
satisfied, but the SEC does not hold for all the observational data sets, which support quintessence. The stability of this
model is verified by the parameters, as illustrated in (see Fig. 4). The late-time acceleration of the universe is supported
by a violation of the SEC. The present value of the jerk cosmographic parameter is j=−0.085238 ,−0.125,−0.097152
for the data sets OHD, Pantheon, and OHD+Pantheon, respectively. This deviates from that of the ΛCDM. Our
model has a quintessence type of behavior at late times. This is shown in the figure of Om(z) which is convex con-
cerning the z-axis and shows stability during the evolution of the universe up to late times except at present (see Fig.
6).
Now, by using the statefinder diagnostic approach, we investigated the behavior of the model and also checked the
divergence and convergence of our model concerning the SCDM and ΛCDM models. From the observed values of q,
we can calculate the values of sandrparameters. The best-fit values of r,s, and qare obtained by the latest OHD,14
Pantheon, and joint data (OHD+Pantheon) (see Fig. 5). The model approaches the ΛCDM model as q→ −1 and
is consistent with [2]. Furthermore, the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied in this model. And, we find the
decreasing behavior of temperature from early to late times (see Fig. 7). Also, We notice that the Hubble parameter
H0is best fitted whereas the deceleration parameter qdoes not fit well according to the recent observations. Thus,
after reviewing the obtained results of our model, we see that our model starts with a Point-type singularity and
behaves like an expanding accelerated dark energy model that is of the quintessence type and tends to the ΛCDM
model at late times.
According to the JDEM surveys, it can be concluded that the Universe is accelerating expanding but with smaller
values of Hubble constant within the structure of power law cosmology. Finally, we can conclude that the power-
law cosmology exhibits many outstanding features despite that it does not succeed in explaining the redshift-based
transition from deceleration to acceleration of the Universe because the deceleration parameter qdoes not depend on
the redshift and time. Thus, we can conclude that the power law cosmology does not fit well in dealing with all the
cosmological challenges despite having several prominent features.
