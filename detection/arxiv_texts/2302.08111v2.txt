ABSTRACT
Detection of hard X-ray spectrum (spectral index <2) from the kilo-parsec scale jet of active galactic nuclei
cannot be accounted to the synchrotron emission mechanism from the electron distribution responsible for the ra-
dio/optical emission. Alternate explanations are the inverse Compt on scattering of cosmic microwave background
photons (IC/CMB) or synchrotron emission from a second electro n population. When the X-ray emission is inter-
preted as IC/CMB process, the Compton spectrum often peaks a t GeV energy and many sources were predicted to
be the Fermi candidate sources. The absence of signiﬁcant gamma ray ﬂux from some of these galaxies by Fermi
disfavored the IC/CMB interpretation of the high energy emission. We extend this study to predict the very high
energy (VHE) gamma ray emission due to IC/CMB model which can be in vestigated by Cherenkov Telescope Array
Observatory(CTAO). The model parametersdeciding the broadb andspectral energy distribution are estimated using
analytical approximation of the emissivity functions. The emission mo del is extrapolated to VHE energy and then
compared with the CTAO sensitivity. For this particular study, we ha ve selected 18 knots with harder X-ray spectrum
and for which the IC/CMB model for X-ray emission was suggested.

1 INTRODUCTION
Localized brightness enhancements found in the kpc/Mpc
scale jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are commonly
termed as knots ( Harris & Krawczynski 2006 ). These knots
are well resolved in radio and optical wavebands. With
the advent of high spatial resolution Chandra Telescope,
the knots were resolved in X-ray bands too. This multi-
wavelength emission from AGN knots are generally mod-
eled using synchrotron and inverse Compton emission
mechanisms. The radio-to-optical emission is well estab-
lished as synchrotron emission from a relativistic elec-
tron distribution losing its energy in the jet magnetic
ﬁeld. On the other hand, the X-ray emission process is
either modelled as the high energy tail of synchrotron
spectrum ( Hardcastle et al. 2001 ;Sambruna et al. 2002 ;
Sahayanathan 2008 ) or as inverse Compton scattering of
soft photon ﬁeld ( Tavecchio et al. 2000 ;Schwartz et al. 2000 ;
Sahayanathan et al. 2003 ;Perlman et al. 2011 ).
The high energy emission from knots, when interpreted

†E-mail:sunder@barc.gov.inas the inverse Compton mechanism, the target photon
ﬁeld at these length scales can be either synchrotron pho-
tons (Schwartz et al. 2000 ); usually called as synchrotron
self Compton(SSC) or the ambient cosmic microwave back-
ground radiation ( Tavecchio et al. 2000 ;Sambruna et al.
2001); termed IC/CMB mechanism. The SSC interpreta-
tion is disfavored as it demands a magnetic ﬁeld that
largely deviates from equipartition ( Tavecchio et al. 2000 ;
Harris & Krawczynski 2006 ). The IC/CMB model; however,
requires the jets to be relativistic even at kpc scales so tha t
in the knot frame, the ambient photon ﬁeld is relativisti-
cally boosted to overpower the synchrotron photon energy
density. Nevertheless, this interpretation is capable of r epro-
ducing the observed X-ray ﬂux from the knots and satisﬁes
near equipartition magnetic ﬁeld ( Sahayanathan et al. 2003 ;
Schwartz et al. 2000 ;Tavecchio et al. 2000 ).
The X-ray ﬂux from the knots, when interpreted as
IC/CMB process, the Compton spectrum peaks at GeV
energy with signiﬁcant radiation at gamma-ray energies.
Hence,Fermiobservations play a crucial role to vali-
date this emission scenario ( Georganopoulos et al. 2006 ).
However, even with a decade of observations, Fermi
©2022 The Authors2Amal A. Rahman et al.
failed to detect any appreciable γ-ray photons from some
sources and the upper limits drawn fall signiﬁcantly be-
low the ﬂux predicted by the IC/CMB emission model
(Meyer & Georganopoulos 2014 ;Meyer et al. 2015 ). Partic-
ularly, the γ-ray studies of the Chandra detected sources
namely, 3C273(CDQ), PKS0637-752(CDQ), PKS1136-
135(LDQ), PKS1229-021(CDQ), PKS1354+195(CDQ)
and PKS2209+080(CDQ) ( Meyer & Georganopoulos 2014 ;
Meyer et al. 2015 ;Breiding et al. 2017 ) have strongly ruled
out the IC/CMB interpretation but favour a scenario where
synchrotron emission from a second population of relativis tic
electrons being responsible for the observed X-ray emissio n
(Liu et al. 2015 ;Tavecchio 2021 ;Harris & Krawczynski 2002 ;
Atoyan & Dermer 2004 ;Kataoka & Stawarz 2005 ). In our
recent work, we show that the advection of electrons from
the regions of particle acceleration can naturally produce two
distinct populations which can successfully explain the X- ray
emission from the kpc scale knots of 3C273 ( Rahman et al.
2022).
Though recent observational evidence, including γ-ray up-
per limits, disfavour the IC/CMB interpretation of X-ray
emission ( Breiding2018 ), it is still apreferred model for those
sources which are not yet ruled out by Fermiobservations
(Kharb et al. 2012 ;Godfrey et al. 2012 ;Stanley et al. 2015 ).
Zhang et al. (2010) present the analysis of 22 hotspots and
45 knots to conclude that IC/CMB model can explain the
X-ray emission from the majority of the jet components.
This study was then extended to a larger number of jet
components and the jet power is estimated under IC/CMB
and SSC emission scenarios for the observed X-ray ﬂuxes
(Zhang et al. 2018 ). The jet power estimated considering
IC/CMB strongly correlate with the jet kinetic power ob-
tained through radio studies. Whereas, the SSC interpreta-
tion didnotexhibitanysigniﬁcant correlation. These ﬁndi ngs
further supported the
IC/CMB as a promising mechanism to explain the high
energy emission from the knots.
Lucchini et al. (2017) revisited some aspects of the
IC/CMBmodeltoshowtherole ofelectroncoolinginshaping
the spectrum. They suggest, the overproduction of gamma-
rays can be avoided by suppressing the high energy end of
the emitting particle population. They applied this model f or
the case of PKS 0637-752 and demonstrated that IC/CMB
can still be a valid explanation for the high energy produc-
tion from the large scale knots of AGN. In this context, it
will be useful to explore the alternative techniques which c an
supplement the Fermi studies to test the plausiblity of the
IC/CMB interpretation for the high energy emission.
Modelling the X-ray emission from kilo-parsec scale jets
using IC/CMB model also suggests this spectrum can ex-
tend up to very high energies (VHE)( Meyer et al. 2021 ,2019;
Georganopoulos et al. 2006 ). Hence, future VHE observa-
tion of these sources can provide further constraints in ad-
dition to the ones drawn through Fermiobservations. The
operational ground-based VHE telescopes employing imag-
ing atmospheric Cherenkov techniques have already detecte d
six radio galaxies with mis-aligned jets at GeV/TeV ener-
gies (Aleksi´ c et al. 2012 ;Aharonian et al. 2009 ,2006;Holder
2011;Dyrda et al. 2015 ;Aleksi´ c et al. 2010 ;Rulten 2022 ).
Among these sources four belong to FRI class of radio galax-
ies (M87, CenA, NGC1275, and 3C264) while other two
(PKS0625-35 andIC310) show theproperties of radiogalaxyand blazar as well ( Wakely & Horan 2008 ). If IC/CMB is a
viableemission process for theX-rayknots, thenthissugge sts
many misaligned jets may be a potential TeV candidate. Al-
ternatively, VHE studies can also be a tool to validate this
emission scenario in tandem with the Fermiobservations.
Considerable advancement in the stereoscopic imaging at-
mospheric Cherenkov techniques have led to new generation
VHE telescopes whose sensitivity are appreciable even at fe w
tens of GeV. Particularly, with the inputs from the upcom-
ing Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), it may be possible to
verify the IC/CMB interpretation of the X-ray knots which
were not been ruled out through Fermiobservations. In the
present work, we selected all the kilo parsec scale X-ray jet s
for which IC/CMB emission process is favoured. We model
the radio and optical ﬂuxes from these sources as synchrotro n
emission from a broken power-law electron distribution. Th e
source parameters are constrained considering equipartit ion
between the magnetic ﬁeld and the particle energy density.
The IC/CMB spectrum is then extrapolated to VHE energies
and compared with the CTA sensitivity curves. The paper is
organised asfollows: Insection2, wedescribethesourcese lec-
tion and in section 3, the spectral models used in the paper.
In section 4 we present our results and discussion. Through-
out this work we consider a cosmology where H0= 71 km
s−1Mpc−1, Ωm= 0.27 and Ω Λ= 0.73.
2 SOURCE SELECTION
Chandra during its two decades operation was able to re-
solve nearly 150 X-ray extended features from AGN1. Many
of these extended jet features showed bright knots and
hotspots which are coincident (near-coincident) with ra-
dio/optical maxima. Spectral energy distribution (SED) of
these knots (and unresolved jet features) in radio, optical
and X-ray have been already analysed and reported in ear-
lier works ( Schwartz et al. 2006 ;Siemiginowska et al. 2007 ;
Wilson et al. 2001 ;Chartas et al. 2000 ). Due to less num-
ber of counts, spectral resolution at these energies cannot be
achieved and the ﬂuxes were reported only for one or few
energy bins ( Massaro et al. 2011 ,2018;Stuardi et al. 2018 ).
However, convoluting the X-ray instrumental response with
a power-law source spectrum, constraints on the spectral in -
dex can be obtained and this can be helpful in identifying the
emission process.
Among the sample of extended X-ray jets collected from
the literature, we selected 18 X-ray knots/components with
radio-optical-X-ray observations and a harder X-ray spec-
trum (spectral index less than 2 or the X-ray ﬂux value
larger than high-energy extension of the radio-to-optical syn-
chrotron spectrum). The X-ray emission from these knots
were interpreted as IC/CMB. Additionally, for these source s,
IC/CMB model were not ruled out by Fermi studies until
2023. In Table 1we provide the list of complete sources and
knots.

where,Kis the normalisation, γis the Lorentz factor of the

lose their energy through synchrotron and inverse Comp-

then the total emissivity from the knot can be obtained as

3.1 Source Parameters
The observed spectrum due to IC/CMB model is mainly gov-
erned by 8 source parameters with 4 of them K,p,qandγb
governing the electron distribution, and the rest are the si ze
of the emission region Rknot, magnetic ﬁeld B, jet Lorentz
factor Γ and the jet viewing angle θ. Besides these, the pa-
rameters γminandγmaxdonotgovern thesource ﬂuxesrather
decidethe lowand highenergy endofradiation spectrum(see
section4). Limited amount of information available in radio,
optical and X-ray bands do not let us to draw stringent con-
straints on these parameters. However, modest constraints
can be imposed by assuming equipartition between the mag-
netic ﬁeld and particle energy densities (equation 3) and the
emission region size of kilo-parsec scale order which is con sis-
tent with the typical radio contours of the knots.

The synchrotron ﬂux at radio/optical in combination with
equation 3can eﬀectively constrain BandKwhile, the spec-
tral indices can be used to identify pandq. The synchrotron
spectral peak frequency can be expressed in terms of the
source parameters as
νp,syn=δD

For a given δD,γbcan be estimated from the approximate
peak frequency. With these constraints we will be left with
the parameters Γ and θwhich can be ﬁne-tuned to reproduce
the X-ray ﬂux due to IC/CMB process. The approximate an-
alytical expressions for the synchrotron and IC/CMB ﬂuxes
are used only to estimate the source parameters. The ﬁnal
model spectrum is produced numerically using exact func-
tional form of the single particle emissivities and compare d
with the observed ﬂuxes.
An upper limit on the angle of the jet to the line of sight
(θ) can be drawn from the apparent superluminal motion ob-
tained through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
observations. Breiding et al. (2023) estimate the upper lim-
its onθfor 3C111, 3C120, PKS1045-188 and 3C454.3 to
be 13.50,12.60,10.50and 4.50respectively. An upper limit of
130is estimated for jet inclination angle of PKSB0106+013
(Kharb et al. 2012 ).Harris et al. (2017) using the apparent
superluminal proper motions of pc-scale jet estimate that
the kpc-scale jet of PKS 1354+195 is aligned at θ≤120.
Dulwich et al. (2009) calculate the viewing angle of 3C 346
to beθ= 14±80. The apparent velocity measurements of
3C 15 is not available. However, Leahy et al. (1997) found
its jet/counter-jet ﬂux density ratio and puts a constraint of
θ≈450−500forβ≥0.9. But, in order to explain the X-ray
emission through IC/CMB model, the jet inclination should
be less than the angle constraint drawn from jet/counter-
jet ratio. Therefore in this work, θis chosen such that the
model curve ﬁts with the observations. The apparent veloc-
ity or jet/counter-jet measurements for sources 3C17 and
PKS2101-490 are not available. Therefore, viewing angle fo r
these sources are chosen such that the IC/CMB model curve
can ﬁt with the radio-optical-X-ray observations of the kno ts.
The sizes of individual knots are constrained using radio da ta
and the value of Rsizeis listed in table 2.
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We apply the IC/CMB model to reproduce the X-ray ﬂux of
18knots/jet componentsfrom thesources whichare notruled
out by initial Fermiobservations (Table 1). As mentioned
earlier, the initial guess parameters are derived from ap-
proximate analytical expressions for the emissivity funct ions
and are then ﬁne tuned to reproduce the radio-optical-X-ray
ﬂuxes using exact numerical solution. The best ﬁt model pa-
rameters (chi-by-eye)for these knotsare giveninTable 2with
their corresponding SEDs shown in Figure 1 and 2.
The parameters γminandγmaxcannot be constrained from
the available information and we have ﬁxed these quanti-
ties at 50 and 103×γb(∼108−109) resectively for all the
SEDs. The Compton up-scattered photon energy scales as
γ2and hence this choice of γmaxassures the Compton spec-
tral component extend up to sixth order from the spectral
peak. The gyro-radius of the electron corresponding to γmaxis∼10−2−10−1pc, which is much less than the assumed
size of the knot. Therefore, this ensures that such high en-
ergyelectrons can still beconﬁnedwithintheemission regi on.
The equipartition magnetic ﬁeld depends on γmin, since the
particle energy density is largely decided by the electrons at
this energy. However, we noted that moderate variation in
γmin(within the same order) do not alter our conclusions
signiﬁcantly.
In order to predict the VHE ﬂux from these knots/jets,
we extended the IC/CMB model spectrum to VHE ener-
gies. The VHE photons produced from distant sources un-
dergo signiﬁcant attenuation through pair production pro-
cess with the extragalalctic background light (EBL). To ac-
count for this, we have considered the EBL spectrum pro-
vided by Franceschini & Rodighiero (2017) and the attenu-
ated VHE spectrum is compared with the 50 hour sensitivity
curve of CTAO obtained from CTAO webpage2. In Fig 1 and
2, the blue solid line is the VHE spectrum after accounting
for the EBL induced attenuation. The red, green and ma-
genta solid line are the 50 hour CTAO diﬀerential sensitivi-
ties of Omega, Alpha (both Northern array) and Omega con-
ﬁguration (Southern array) respectively. The Fermigamma-
ray upper limits/detections are shown as green color invert ed
triangles/solid circles. Out of all the knots studied, we ﬁn d
the knots of 3C111 (K30), 3C120 (K4) and a section of
3C120 jet (S2) fall within the detection threshold of CTAO.
The SED corresponding to these knots/jet is shown in Fig.
1 along with the CTAO sensitivity curve. The knots whose
VHE model ﬂux fall below the CTAO sensitivity curve are
shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, both 3C120 and 3C111 can be
detected from the Northern site of the Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) at reasonable zenith angles.
Among the two sources predicted as a CTAO VHE candi-
date underIC/CMB model, 3C111 belongs toFRIImorphol-
ogy (Fanaroﬀ & Riley 1974 ) located at z=0.049. The radio
observation suggests a 100 kilo-parsec long jet and Chandra
was able to resolve nearly 10 knots with at least eight which
are prominent in X-rays ( Clautice et al. 2016 ). Among them,
theknots K22, K30and K61 indicate ahard X-rayspectrum
suggesting an inverse Compton origin of the X-ray emission.
Whereas, the knots K9, K14, K38, K45, K51, K97 and
K107 has steeper X-ray spectrum supporting a synchrotron
origin (Zhang et al. 2018 ). Hence, for the present work we
have considered only the three X-ray knots K30, K61 and
K22, with K30 being the brightest among them. Modelling
the X-ray emission as IC/CMB mechanism predicts signiﬁ-
cant VHE ﬂux for the knot K30 which can be examined by
future CTAO observations. The predicted VHE ﬂux of K61
and K22 fall below the CTAO sensitivity though the X-ray
ﬂuxofK61is comparablewithK30.Weanticipatethereason
for this being the steep X-ray spectrum of K61 as compared
to K30.
Recently, ( Breiding et al. 2023 ) ruled out the IC/CMB in-
terpretation of the X-ray emission for 3C111 considering th e
knot K61 through the updated Fermiupper limits (these up-
per limits are shown as blue inverted triangles in Fig. 1 and
2). However, the steep X-ray index of the knot K61 is not
consistent with the model spectrum and this can cause am-
biguity (See Fig. A6 in ( Breiding et al. 2023 )). On the other

hand, the X-ray spectrum of K30 is hard and can provide
better constraints. Comparing the predicted gamma ray ﬂux
of this knot with the updated Fermiupper limits again dis-
favours the IC/CMB interpretation. Nevertheless, studyin g
this source at VHE will be an additional conﬁrmation to this
conjecture or may provide stronger constraints on the emis-
sion model if detected.
Thesecond source predictedas aVHEcandidate for CTAO
under IC/CMB model is 3C120 located at z=0.033 which
is a broad line radio galaxy initially classiﬁed as Seyfert I
(Sahakyan et al. 2015 ). The radio morphology of the source
is similar to FR I class with radio structures extending up to
100 kpc and superluminal components identiﬁed with VLBI
studies ( Walker et al. 2001 ,1987). The X-ray jet consists of
four bright knots K4, K7, K25 and K80 and two sections of
the jet S2 and S3 bright in X-rays ( Harris et al. 1999 ). The
X-ray spectrum for the knot K7 and the jet component S3
is steep supporting a synchrotron origin while K4 and S2
suggests IC/CMB origin due to hard X-ray spectrum. The
knots K25 and K80 are not well resolved in optical waveband
(Harris et al. 2004 ). Hence, in this work we have considered
only the knot K4 and the jet component S2, and modelled
their X-ray emission through IC/CMB process. Extrapolat-
ing this emission model to VHE suggests, the gamma-ray
ﬂux from these regions fall within the 50-hour sensitivity o f
CTAO. In Fig. 1, we show the model spectrum correspond-
ing to synchrotron and IC/CMB emission processes along
with the observed radio–optical–X-ray ﬂuxes. The CTAO
sensitivity curve is shown in red solid line while the Fermi
gamma-ray upper limits/detections are shown as green color
inverted triangles/solid circles. Though the model curve f alls
within this Fermiupper limits, recent upper limits(blue in-
verted traingles in Fig.1) derived from 12 years of observa-
tion again disfavours the IC/CMB model for this source also
(Breiding et al. 2023 ).
The analytical approximation for the inverse Compton
emissivity (equation ( 5)) is arrived considering the scatter-
ing process to happen in Thomson regime. However, at VHE
energythescatteringmaybeinelasticandbetterdescribed by
the Klein-Nishina cross section. In order to investigate th is,
we draw limits on the target photon energy beyond which
the scattering process deviates from the Thomson condition
(Ghisellini & Tavecchio 2009 ). This happens when the target
photonenergymeasuredintheelectronrestframe exceeds(o r
equal to) the rest mass energy ( Blumenthal & Gould 1970 ).
Using this condition along with the scattered photon energy
estimated under Thomson regime, one can arrive the condi-
tion on target photon frequency as ( Ghisellini & Tavecchio
2009;Sahayanathan & Godambe 2012 )

where,ν∗is the frequency of target photon in AGN frame,
νis the scattered photon (VHE) frequency in observer frame
andδD/Γ≈1.5 (for Γ = 4 .0 andθ= 90corresponding to
the knot K30 of 3C111). For IC/CMB process the target
photon frequency is ≈1.6×1011Hz and the scattering falls
within the Thomson regime. Nevertheless, in the numerical
code used to reproduce the model spectrum we have consid-ered the exact Klein-Nishina cross section for the IC scatte r-
ing (Dermer & Schlickeiser 1993 ).
The jet components(or knots) considered in this work are
located at kilo-parsec scale distances from the AGN core. Fo r
instance, the jet components that fall within the detection
threshold of CTAO, K4 and S2 of 3C120 are at distances
larger than 2.5 kpc from their core ( Harris et al. 1999 ). And
the knot K30 of 3C111 is approximately at a distance of 60
kpc from the core ( Clautice et al. 2016 ). At this large scale
distances, the dominant photon ﬁeld is Cosmic Microwave
Background Radiation(CMBR) compared to other photon
ﬁelds associated with galaxy. Additionally, the relativis tic
boosting increases the energy density of the CMB in the jet
frame by Γ2while, other external photon ﬁeld like starlight,
thermal infrared radiation from the dusty torus and emissio n
from the accretion disk fall behind the relativic motion of t he
emission region and hence, their energy density will be re-
ducedby ≈Γ2(Begelman et al. 1984 ).Hardcastle & Croston
(2011) has modelled the TeV γ-ray emission from M87 and
CenAconsideringinverse Compton scatteringof variouspho -
tonﬁeldsbythehigh-energyelectrons responsible for thes yn-
chrotron X-rays on kiloparsec scale. However, for this stud y
they have considered only the inner jet region which fall
within a kpc from core and the contribution of photon ﬁelds
other than CMB are also substantial.
Inthiswork,we attempttostudytheAGNwithmisaligned
jets which are the probable VHE candidates for CTAO. Such
misaligned AGN jets have already been studied at VHE and
the ﬁrst signiﬁcant detection was the FR I source M87 lo-
cated at a distance 16 Mpc (z = 0.0043)( Aharonian et al.
2006). Observations of this source from 2003 till 2006 by
H.E.S.S witness the ﬂux variability in timescale of few days .
Constraints on the emission region size drawn from this
variability timescale suggests the VHE emission to be aris-
ing very close to the central engine. The plausible loca-
tions are the bright inner most knot HST-1 or the nu-
cleus of M87. Diﬀerent emission models have been pro-
posed favouring either of these regions albeit a consensus
was never arrived ( Rieger & Aharonian 2008 ;Lenain et al.
2008;Levinson & Rieger 2011 ;Hardcastle & Croston 2011 ;
Fraija et al. 2012 ;Rieger 2012 ).
The other misaligned AGN which are detected in
VHE are CenA ( Aharonian et al. 2009 ), NGC1275
(Aleksi´ c et al. 2012 ), 3C264 ( Holder 2011 ), PKS0625-354
(HESS Collaboration et al. 2018 ) and IC310 ( Aleksi´ c et al.
2010). An important challenge often encountered while
explaining the VHE emission from these sources is the neces-
sity of substantial Doppler boosting. In case of blazars, th e
jet is aligned close to the line of sight and hence the emissio n
is signiﬁcantly Doppler boosted. This allow the gamma ray
emission to overcome the pair production losses since the
rest frame photon energy is less than the observed energy
(Dondi & Ghisellini 1995 ). In case of misaligned AGN, the
Doppler boosting will be minimal due to large viewing angle
of the jet. This introduces strong constraints on the choice
of the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet and the viewing angle
(Singal 2016 ). However, the viewing angle inferred from
studying the broadband spectral energy distribution of the
source often conﬂicts with the ones obtained through radio
morphological studies ( Reynoso et al. 2011 ;Fujita & Nagai
2017).
The low energy tail of the electron distribution upscatter-

ing the CMB photons to X-ray energies are also responsi-
ble for the radio emission through synchrotron process. Thi s
predicts the knots observed at these energy bands to be
co-spatial. However, the observed oﬀset between X-ray and
radio centroids of the knots from the large scale jets con-
tradict this co-spatiality ( Reddy et al. 2021 ). The relatively
longer cooling time of low energy electrons also suggest the
X-ray emission to be persistent downstream in the jet along
with radio. However, in many cases, X-ray emission is lo-
calized and do not show continuity similar to radio maps
(Harris et al. 2006 ). These observational features advocate
against the IC/CMB interpretation of the X-ray emission.
Another line of evidence challenging IC/CMB is the detec-
tion of X-ray counter jet in Pictor A ( Hardcastle et al. 2016 ).
The jet counter-jet ratio for this source suggests the jet vi ew-
ing angle θ <450and the jet velocity v≤0.5c. The IC/CMB
models for the X-ray emission; on the other hand, demands
larger jet velocity to boost the CMB photons signiﬁcantly in
theframeoftheemission region. Accordingly,smaller view ing
angles are also assumed. Similarly, the high degree of X-ray
polarisation witnessed in certain knots ( Cara et al. 2013 ), the
knotﬂuxvariability( Hardcastle et al. 2016 ) andthedeﬁcitof
correlation between the ratio of X-ray to radio jet luminosi ty
with the source redshift ( Snios et al. 2021 ) poses strong chal-
lenges to the IC/CMB interpretation of the X-ray emission.
Observation of the sources 3C111 and 3C120 in VHE can
further verify this emission model and in addition, provide
clues regarding the high energy emission process.
5 SUMMARY
The highenergyemission from theknotsofkpcscale AGNjet
is often interpreted as the inverse Compton up-scattering o f
Cosmic microwave background radiation by relativistic par -
ticles in the jet (IC/CMB). However, the gamma-ray upper
limits derived from the long term observation of these sourc es
byFermidisfavours this interpretation. In this work, we per-
form a detailed multiwavelength modelling of the knots of
the AGN jets which are detected in X-rays using synchrotron
and IC/CMB processes. The source parameters deciding the
broadband spectral energy distribution are estimated usin g
approximate analytical expression for the emissivity func -
tions. The emission model is extrapolated to VHEenergy and
then compared with the CTAO sensitivity. We ﬁnd the VHE
model ﬂux of certain knots/jet components of two sources,
3C111and3C120, fall wellabovetheCTAOsensitivity.How-
ever, the recently updated Fermiupper limits again disfavors
IC/CMB interpretation for the high energy emission from
these sources. Therefore any sources in our study, if detect ed
in VHE, would probably favour the second population inter-
pretation for the high energy emission rather than IC/CMB.
