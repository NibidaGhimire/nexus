Abstract  
 The residual stress plays a vital role in determination of  the device performance that uses  thin films coating and thus the accurate 
determination of stress and its optimization with process parameters is  an ongoing research work for many decades . In line with 
this, the microscopic origin of the stress at the atomic scale and its development during the thin film deposition is  a matter of major  
scientific interest s. The development of stress is a complex phenomenon and has a complex dependence to process parameters , film 
microstructure and its morphology. In this work, by utilizing a custom -designed cathodic arc deposition  system  and synchrot ron 
radiation based 2D x-ray diffraction  (XRD)  technique, we determine the real -time evolution of stress, crystallite sizes and their 
preferential orientations of Aluminum -Titanium -Nitride (Al xTi1-xN) films with varied Al -content (x=0. 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.67) on 
Si-100 substrate . The energies of incoming ions and hence stress in the films is tuned  by applying different  direct current substrate  
bias (Vs = floating potential, -20, -40, -60, -80, and -100 V ). The instantaneous stress is evaluated by the well-known d vs. sin2ψ 
technique , while crystallite sizes are determined by analyzing line profiles of x -ray diffractogram s. The evolution of stress and 
crystallite sizes are modelled with multiple numerical models from which  kinetic parameters associated with the thin film 
depositions are extracted.  The ex -situ microstructure characterizations of Al xTi1-xN coatings  are carried out by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM)  and transmission electron microscopy  (TEM) . The f ormation of ex -situ microstructure of the films is discussed 
considering  the results obtained from in -situ XRD data. Finally, we demonstrate that the method utilized here is a powerful approach  
towards  estimation of the fracture toughness of thin film  coatings.

 I. INTRODUCTION:  
Thin  film coatings  are the building blocks of today ’s technology. Their application s are widespread , such as  in, semiconductor 
devices  [1,2] , optoelectronics  [3], micro  and nano electromechanical systems  [4], detectors  [5], energy storage  [6], optical mirrors  
[7], and wear  and corrosion -resistant coating  [8], etc. Since thin film  are deposited over a lattice -mismatched surface of a single 
crystalline substrate material , they are often strained. In addition , the deposition process  is a non -equilibrium phenomenon , leading 
to the generation of residual stress es in the coatings  [9]. This residual stress plays a vital role in the performance during their 
application.  While a high value of tensile stress leads to cracking [10], compressive stress can cause  buckling, blistering, and 
delamination  of the coatings  [11–13]. Thus, accurate determination and optimization of stress in the thin film is of great 
technological importance, and hence over the last 100 years it has  been pursued [14,15] . The strain/ stress is also an important 
external parameters that  can enabled many material properties , such as electrical and thermal conductivity  [16], ferroelectricity  [17] 
, piezoelectricity  [18], optical properties  [19], mechanical hardness  [20,21] , etc. Besides their post -deposition stress determination, 
understanding the evolution of stress during their deposition is of scientific interest.   
 
There are various methods  for the determination of residual stresses in coatings , such as wafer curvature measured by multibeam 
optical stress sensors (MOSS)  [9], synchrotron x-ray diffraction  [22], holographic transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  [23], 
micro -Raman spectroscopy  [24], and electron diffraction  [25]. Amongst all, largely MOSS has been successfully used in the in-situ 
evaluation of stress during thin film depositions. While MOSS is very powerful in determining the macroscop ic stress of the entire 
films for both crystalline  as well as amorphous samples, it will not reveal any information about microstructure evolution. In 
contrast , x-ray diffraction can provide both in -situ strain and information on microstructure  simultaneously , but it is limited to only 
crystalline materia ls. Using MOSS, the study of stress evolution during the growth of polycrystalline thin film s is extensively 
investigated , but most of them are on pure metal  films on insulator substrate s only [26–29]. In addition, a few reports are available 
where MOSS was used to study  the stress evolution in a complex compound system , such as transition metal nitrides  [30–33]. 
However, all  these nitrides thin films were deposited with a relatively lower deposition rate technique , such as magnetron sputtering.  
 
Polycrystalline thin film of m ulti-component alloys of transition metals nitrides  (TMNs) , particularly ( Al,Ti)N-based coatings are 
the current workhorse of the cutting tool  industry. The success of the (Al,Ti)N materials system compared to traditional TiN hard 
coatings has been attributed  to 1) increased oxidation resistance  with increasing aluminium content  [34]; and 2) the associated age -
hardening effect  with elevating working temperature , due to  the formation of  coherency strain s between c-TiN and metastable c -
AlN.   domains  by spinodal decomposition  [35]. For  superior oxidation resistant and enhanced thermomechanical properties , a 
higher concentration of Al is preferable , but the aluminium content in cubic -(Al,Ti)N  is limited to ≈ 65% due to thermodynamic 
limitations  [36,37] . Above 65% of Al content, the formation of additional hexagonal (Al,Ti)N  crystallizes, which has inferior 
mechanical properties compared to the cubic phase  [38,39] . The mechanical  properties and consequently the tool's performance is 
also influenced by the microstructure of the coating , i.e., the grain size, density , grain orientation, dislocation density , etc. Suggested 
by the Hall -Petch relation [40], that above a critical grain size the hardness of the overall coating material increases with decreasin g 
grain size . A common approach to  modify  the grain size can be accomplished  by energetic ion bombardment s, which are controlled  
by applying a negative  electrical bias to the substrate s urface  [39,41] . The physical vapour  depositions process especially in cathodic 
arc evaporation comprises a high density of metal ions and multiple charge states, thus their kinetic energy can  be increased 
substantially by applying a negative DC bias to the substrate  [42].  Upon bombardment of these high -speed ions on top of already 
growing surfaces of the films can modify  the stress level  as well as the orientation of the grains in the polycrystalline thin 
films [43,44] . Such a change in the preferred orientati on strong ly correlate s to its mechanical properties , [45–49] hence also its 
performance during the actual service conditions [50,51] . 
Although cathodic arc deposition is the industrial preferred technique for (Al,Ti)N -based coatings, the evolution of microstructure 
and strain/s tress during deposition are still not well understood and scarcely studied.  Here we present the in-situ real -time evolution 
of coating stress and microstructure during growth of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cathodic arc deposited (Al,Ti)N  alloy  coating s as a 
function of substrate bias (Vs). Both t he stress state and microstructure of the coatings were evaluated and analys ed by synchrotron  
x-ray diffract ogram s recorded during film growth . All depositions were carried out in a specially designed  UHV  deposition system , 
adapted for synchrotron radiation studies  [52]. 
II. EXPERIMENT AL DETAILS : 
Alloyed (Al,Ti)N coating s with varied Al -content ( AlxTi1-xN) on Si (100)  substrate are deposited by  reactive  cathodic arc deposition 
technique , where the deposition system  is schematically shown in Figure 1. 63 mm diameter size metallic Ti (Grade -2), and alloys 
of Al 0.25Ti0.75, Al 0.50Ti0.50, and Al0.67Ti0.33 (FK-Grade) are used as cathode s. The cathode current  is fixed at  75 A  for all depositions .  
3 
 The cathode s are mounted on home -designed holders, which are further mounted on a specially designed chamber lid [52]. The 
angle between the surface normal of the cathode s to the  substrate normal is 35° (see Figure 1). The d istance between the substrate 
and the  cathode is ≈ 12 cm.  Pure (99.9995%)  nitrogen  (N2) flow is introduced into a n ultra-high vacuum system  with a base pressure 
of 10-8 Torr. During the deposition of all Al xTi1-xN, the growth  pressure  is fixed at 40 mTorr. Prior to deposition the Si (100) substrate 
is cleaned  by ultrasonic bath  with isopropyl alcohol and dried by blowing dry air. For all depositions, t he substrate is heated up to 
450°C by an 808 nm infrared laser diode (Dilas Diode Laser, Inc.) powered by a 300 W power supply (Lumina Power, Inc. ). The 
laser beam is focused on a susceptor material, here silicon carbide (SiC), which then heats the substrate via thermal conduction and 
radiation. The substrate is rotated at a speed of 5 rotation s per minute (RPM).  The applied volage in electrical bias to substrate  (Vs) 
is applied by using a DC power supply, and is varied between the depositions  from -20 to -100 V in steps of -20 V.  In addition, 
depositions at floating potential (FP) are also performed. The duration of the deposition of all coatings is fixed at 10 minutes. During 
the experiments, the deposition chamber was fixed to  a high-resolution  hexapod  with a resolution in x/y/z movement o f ±1 µm .  
The film microstructure and final thickness is determined from a fractured cross -sectional view using a FESEM (Leo 1550 Gemini) 
operated at 5 kV. Microstructural characterization of the coatings was made by TEM  and STEM using an FEI Tecnai G220 UT 
microscope operated at 200  kV. In-situ x -ray diffractograms of Al xTi1-xN coatings are recorded in transmission mode during the 
deposition of the coatings by utilizing synchrotron radiation at the P07 High Ener gy Materials Science (HEMS) beamline at PETRA 
III (Deutsches Elektronen -Synchrotron (DESY); Hamburg, Germany). The energy of the x -ray photons is selected to 73.79 keV. 
The beam slit widths are fixed at 100×600 μm2. The diffractograms are recorded with a 2 D flat panel detector with 2048x2048 
pixles (PerkinElmer XRD 1622). The exposure time for recording one diffractogram is 0.2 s, and ten such patterns are superpos ed 
with each other to generate a final diffractogram. The distance between substrate and detec tor is evaluated by recording the 
diffractogram of NIST standard LaB 6 powder. In this set of experiments, the distance is determined to be 3.373 m. The detector was 
positioned to collect one quadrant of the diffraction pattern for optimizing the resolution .   
 
Figure 1.  The sketch of the experimental setup of our experiments.  The angle between substrate’s surface normal and the normal 
to cathode targets surface is 35°.  The relationship between Φ and ψ is also shown in the 2D - XRD pattern.  
The 2-dimensional  XRD patterns are transformed into one -dimensional lineout s by integration in ≈  5°-8° wide azimuthal bins  (𝜓). 
The interplanar lattice spacing ( dhkl) is determined by fitting the one -dimensional lineout with a pseudo -Voight function.  The 
details of the  method used in estimation of in -plane strain and biaxial stress  is given in section SI.  I of supplementary information 
(SI). In determination of stress, high temperature (450 °C) elastic constants of AlxTi1-xN are used (see Ref. [53] and section SI. I of 
SI for details).  
  
The crystallite size is approximated to coherently diffracting domains ( ⟨𝐷hkl⟩), and at a film thickness,  tf, (⟨𝐷hkl(tf)⟩) is 
estimated using  the Debye -Scherrer formula  [54]. 
⟨𝐷hkl(tf=𝑡)⟩= 0.9 × λ
ζ(tf=t)cosθ(tf=t)    (1) 
        
Where 𝜆 is the wavelength of the x -ray beam, 𝜁(tf =t) and 𝜃(tf=t) are the the instrumental broadening corrected  FWHM of 
the one -dimensional lineouts in radians and half of diffraction angle, 2𝜃, of ℎ𝑘𝑙 crystal planes at  𝑡𝑓=𝑡 , respectively .  The 
 
4 
 instrumental broadening was determined from the FWHM of the diffraction signal from the LaB 6 powder.   The ⟨Dhkl⟩ of AlxTi1-xN 
coatings along the GD ( D111GD) as deposited with different V s are obtained by integrating the intensity of diffractograms from ψ = 
0o to 10o of c-111 crystal planes. Evolutions of D 111 along the IP -direction ( D111IP) are obtained by measuring  line width profiles of 
the diffractograms formed close to the IP -direction of c -111 crystal planes. The respective values of range of ψ used in integration 
of diffraction intensities are mentioned in the later sections.  
 
The evolution of average crystallite  size, ⟨𝐷hkl(tf)⟩ with the fi lm thickness tf, along  the in-plane direction is modelled with a 
power law as follows.  
 
⟨𝐷hkl(tf)⟩=𝑘×tfn      (2) 
 
The evolution of film thickness, 𝑡𝑓, average 𝜎 as a function of 𝑡𝑓 is modelled using a power law,  
 
⟨𝜎(𝑡𝑓)⟩=𝜎0+𝑐×𝑡𝑓−𝛾     (3) 
 
The 𝜎0 are the converged ⟨𝜎(𝑡𝑓)⟩ at large 𝑡𝑓. The scaling parameter  𝑐 and ε′ are the coefficient s related to the rate of grain 
boundary shrinkage with an exponent of 𝛾 [55]. The 𝜎 evolution  of AlxTi1-xN coatings is also modelled using a recently developed 
kinetic model proposed by Chason et al. [56] and is given by :  
 
⟨σ(tf=t)⟩=σc+(σT,0(L0)
L(tf=t)0.5−σc)×exp(−βDeffRL(tf=t) ⁄ )+A(l
L(tf=t))
+(1−l
L(tf=t))×B× 1

where 𝜎𝑐 is the compressive stress that is generated by  the insertion of ions at the grain boundary, which is fixed at -0.02 GPa in 
our work  [30]. 𝜎𝑇,0(𝐿0) is the tensile stress generated by the formation of a new segment of grai n boundar ies with a grain size 
of L0. L(tf=t) is the average grain size at tf=𝑡, approximated to in -plane ⟨𝐷hkl(tf)⟩ in our fitting . 𝛽 is a parameter that 
depends upon the mechanical properties of the layer and concentration of mobile defects. Deff is the effective diffusivity of atoms 
from surface to grain boundary. R is the rate at which grain boundary height is changing , which is approximated by the film growth 
rate in our work. The t hird and fourth term s of Eqn.  4 represent stress due to energetic vapour fluxes. The third  term is related to 
collision -induced densification of grain boundary , while the last term is due to the formation of defects in bulk with a depth of l 
from the surface. Parameter τs is the characteristic time at which defects created in bulk migrate to the surface and annihilate. The 
parameter 𝜏𝑠 is further approximated t o, 
τs=l
R[α−1−α√1−2
α ]    
 
where 𝛼 = Di/2R𝑙. Di represent the diffusivity of the defect created in bulk. Parameters A and B are adjustable parameters. In this 
work , a least -square s method  is used to fit Eqn. 3 and 4 to the experimentally obtained  data. While fitting of Eqn. 7 is named  as 
Model 1, fitting of experimental 𝜎 with Eqn.  8 will be named  as Model 2 in the rest of th is paper.  In fitting of Model 2 to the 
experimental data , A and B are restricted to have a negative  value. While 𝜎𝑐 is fixed at -0.2 GPa for all composition s of AlxTi1-xN, 
σT,0(L0) is tuned to get a better fitting , but kept fixed for one composition, i.e., 0.67 GPa, 0.85 GPa, 1.00 GPa, and 2.5 0 GPa for 
L0 = 100 nm in TiN, Al 0.25Ti0.75N, Al 0.50Ti0.50N, Al 0.67Ti0.33N, respectively.  Quality of fitting of both Model  1 and Model  2 are 
assessed by a R -squared (𝑅2) analysis.  
III. FORMATION  AND EVOLUTION OF MICROSTRUCTURE :  
A. Formation of crystal phases,  and crystallographic  texture   
Recorded diffractogram s of all samples at the end of deposition are displayed in Figure 2. The corresponding Miller indices of 
different diffraction sp ots/rings are identified by measuring interplanar distances  (or corresponding 2θ values)  and are marked  
5 
 accordingly . AlxTi1-xN: x ≤ 0.5 coatings show  the formation of only cubic  crystal  phases  (c-) (see Figure 2 (a-o)), while Al 0.67Ti0.33N 
coatings grown with |V s| ≤ 60 V show mixed cubic and hexagonal  phases  (h-) (see Figure 2 (p-r)). At a higher V s (i.e., -80 and -100 
V) no detectable hexagonal phases of AlxTi1-xN are seen  (see Figure 2 (s-u) and Figure S -6 (a) of SI ). 
TiN coating deposited at Vs = FP shows a preferred orientation of c -111 planes along the growth direction (GD), along with a 
minority component at an angle of ψ ≈ 74° to the growth direction (see Figure 2 (a)). The angle between the (111) and (200) 
direction s in a cubic crystal is ~55°, corresponding well to the preferred orientation seen for the c -200 rings (see Figure 2 (a)). TiN 
coatings deposited with V s = -20V and -40 V, the crystallite s in the films orient more random ly, but higher intensity diffraction s pots 
are present in c -200 ring at an angle of ψ ≈ 22°/20 ° and ψ ≈70°/77° (see Figure 2 (b-c)). TiN samples deposited at V s = -60, -80, and 
-100 V show the formation of the preferred orientation of crystallites with c -111 along the GD and intense diffraction from c -200 
appears c lose to a 18˚⁓20° inclination angle to the GD  (see Figure 2 (d-f)). The texture of c -200 at close to ψ ≈70° is consequent of 
the 90 ° rotational symmetry of the c -200 crystal planes in the FCC lattice.  
 
 
Figure 2. 2D x -ray diffractograms of AlxTi1-xN coatings deposited on Si (100) substrate at different substrate bias voltages (V s). 
Diffraction from hkl planes of cubic phases is denoted as c -hkl, while for hexagonal phases they are denoted as h -hkil where i= -
(h+k).  The unmarked high intensities spots are from Si substrates.   
The Al0.25Ti0.75N coating deposited at V s = FP shows a preferred orientation of c -111 along the GD and c -200 at an angle ψ ≈55 (see 
Figure 2 (g)). With V s = -20 V , the orientation of c -200 planes splits along two distinct ψ orientations: (i) one at ψ ≈22° and (ii) at 
ψ ≈77° (see Figure 2 (h-i)). There are three distinct intense regions  in the c -111 Debye ring: (i) at ψ ≈ 37°, (ii) at ψ ≈ 60°, and (iii) 
at ψ ≈77°. The application of V s also influenced the texture of c -111 crystallographic planes. The diffractogram s of Al 0.25Ti0.75N 
coating s for both V s = -20 and -40 V are similar, except in the latter case the c -200 crystal planes are tilted a bit closer towards the 
GD with a tilt angle of 17°. The intense spots of c -111 at an angle ψ ∈ [37°,  40°] are from the crystallographic c -111 planes of the 
grains which c -200 planes are inclined at angle of ψ ∈≈ [-15°, -20°]. The intense spots of c-111 at an angle ≈ 60° are from the same 
grains for which c -200 planes are at an inclined angle close to  ψ ∈ [+15°,  +20°]. The intense c -111 close ψ ≈ 75° is from different 
grains altogether , whose c -200 diffraction spots should be close to ψ ≈45°, i.e.,  tilted away  from the GD. A faint c-200 in these 
regions indicate the grain volume of these grains are smaller. With  further increase in V s to -60 V the c -200 crysta l planes are found 
to be along the GD with a broader azimuthal distribution (see Figure 2 (j)). Note that the Al 0.25Ti0.75N coating deposited with V s = -
60 V shows a cohesive failure to the substrate during its film deposition. Similar behaviour in the diffractogram of Al 0.50Ti0.50N is 
 
6 
 also seen. The coating s deposited at V s = -60 V and -80 V both show a predominant texture of c -200 along the GD and c ohesive 
failure of the coatings  (discussed later)  (see Figure 2 (n-o).  
Unlike the above -discussed compositions of AlxTi1-xN: x ≤0.5, the diffractogram s from Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings show a different 
crystallographic texture formation . Formation of both hexagonal and cubic phases crystals are noticed (see Figure 2(p-u) and Figure 
S-6 of SI). X -ray diffractogram s recorded from Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with V s = FP show h -101̅    0 crystal planes are aligned 
along the GD and at an inclined angle of 33° to the GD (see Figure 2 (p)). A clear and sharp diffraction spot correspondin g to h -
0002 planes is in parallel to the IP direction (see Figure 2 (p)). The c -111 and c -200 crystal plane s of Al0.67Ti0.33N are inclined at an 
angle 40° and 49° to the GD , respectively. Weakly textured c -111 and c -200 crystal planes of c-AlTiN phases are also seen along 
the IP (see Figure 2 (p)). Since the angle between these two c -111 and c -200 is not in agreement with the crystallographic a ngle 
(≈55 °) between c -111 and c -200 in FCC lattice, we suggest both are from two distinct grain s with different  orientations.  Based on 
analysis of symmetry of the crystal structure , we find that the c -200 crystal planes of the grains whose c -111 planes are at an angle 
of 40° to the GD should be at around 95° from the GD [hence 5 ° from the IP direction]. And the c -111 planes of grains whose c -
200 are at inclined angle of 49 ° to the GD  should be at around 84 ° from the GD.  Presence of diffraction spots of c -111 and c -200 
along and close to the IP direction agrees well with this prediction . With V s= -20 and -40 V, the crystal planes’ orientation changes 
dramatically. The crystallographic orientation of c -111 and c -200 planes are random , along with h -0002 and h -101̅    0 planes oriented 
along the GD and towards the IP direction , respectively (see Figure 2 (q-r)). Surprisingly, for Al0.67Ti0.33N coatings deposited with 
|Vs | ≥ 60 V, no sign of diffractogram s corresponding to hexagonal phase are observed (see Figure 2 (s-u)). The intense spots of the 
Debye ring corresponding to c -200 crystal planes of Al 0.67Ti0.33N are at an angle 16°, 18°, and 24°  to the G D for coatings deposited 
at V s= -60, 80, and 100 V , respectively. The c -111 planes are orientated at an angle of 42° /44° to the GD for all films (see Figure 2 
(s-u)). A fixed tilt angle of intense of c -111 and varied c -200 clearly establish  that both intense diffraction patterns  are originated 
from different grains with different orientations.  
B. Ex-situ surface morphology, film thickness, and growth rate  
Cross -section SEM micrographs revealed that all films have a columnar structure ( see Figure 3). The total  film thickness  tf of AlxTi1-
xNcoating , determined from the cross -sections viewed in the SEM, are tabulated in Table 1 . The TiN coating grown at V s = FP 
shows the formation of relatively smaller domain size, and loosely packed nanocolumns w ith gaps (voids) between ne ighbour 
nanocolumns at the bottom part of the coating extend ing to the top. With an increase in |V s| (≥ 20 V) during the thin film deposition, 
the TiN coatings densify with a larger domain size of nanocolumns. A closer look into the cross -sectional SEM images  of TiN 
coatings deposited with a finite V s reveals the formation of individual thin NC s until tf of ≈ 200 -300 nm beyond which they 
coalescence to form broad nanocolumns (NCs) .  
Similar morphology evolution under different V s is observed for Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N. A major difference in the cross -
sectional morphologies of Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coatings deposited at V s =FP is noticed where in the latter case the 
nanocolumns are more isolated than the former one. Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coatings deposited above |V s | ≥ 60 V show 
characteristic features of a coating with cohesive failure that occurred during the film deposition. In these films two disti nct tf can 
be seen (see Figure 3 (j, n, and o)). The electron micrographs obtained from Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating differ from those with lower Al 
content. While Al 0.67Ti0.33N films grown at V s= FP a nanocolumnar structure is seen, with an applied V s the cross -sectional SEM 
image shows a densely packed nanocrystalline  like morphology.

Figure 3 shows fractured cross -sectional FESEM micrographs of AlxTi1-xN coatings deposited on Si (100) substrate at different 
substrate bias voltage (V s). The scale bar is 200 nm .  
 
Planview SEM micrographs of the TiN coatings grown at V s = FP and -20 V reveal a platelet -like surface morphology with the 
presence of nanometre size pores in coating grown with FP substrate bias (see dotted red circles in Figure S -2 of SI). TiN coatings 
grown with |V s| ≥ 40 V shows granular morphology indicati ng the formation of faceted nanocolumns. Surface morphologies of for 
Al0.25Ti0.25N coatings deposited at V s = FP and -20 V are similar to the TiN coatings deposited at the same V s. But coatings deposited 
at |V s| ≥ 40 V are different from those of TiN, where  the top of nanocolumns are faceted but relatively flatter than those of TiN. Plan 
view SEM of Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating grown with V s = FP shows a clear view of sharp pyramidal faceted nanocolumns with the clear 
presence of voids between them. At higher V s, the surface morphologies are compact and flat faceted. Unlike AlxTi1-xN: x ≤0.5, 
surface morphologies of Al 0.67Ti0.33N are granular and with the increase in bias the domain sizes of coatings are finer. Low 
magnification SEM images show cohesive failure and in -plane spallation of coatings (see Figure S -3 of SI).  
 
To get a deeper insight into the microstructure, we probed the microstructure of TiN coatings (V s  = FP and -40 V) with ex -situ TEM 
(see Figure 4). Clearly, below tf of 400 nm the domain sizes are different from those  above it (see Figure 4Error! Reference sourc e 
not found.   (a-1 and b -1)). Towards the interfaces of coatings and substrate the domain sizes are s maller, and their  number  densities 
are higher compared to the top of the coatings . With tf larger than 400 nm, the in -plane domain sizes of the TiN coating deposited 
with V s  = FP is almost constant at ~ 100 nm (see Figure 4 (a-1)). A closer look at the top of the coatings reveal that a few 
nanocolumns are separated from each other by a few nanometres size gaps (see arrow marked region of Figure 4 (a-2)). The selected 
area electron diffraction (SAED)  pattern from overall region of films and substrate reveal a spotty diffractogram suggesting 
 
8 
 formation of crystalline and textured grains  (see Figure 4 (a-3)). The predominant c -111 diffraction along the GD agrees with our 
in-situ XRD, suggesting no change in the grain orientation during the cooling down of the coatings as well as post -deposition. HR -
TEM images recorded close to the interface of coating and substrate revealed that crystallites formed at tf close to ≈ 2 nm are having 
an interplanar spacing close to 0.21 nm, and hence crystal planes are identified as c -200 (see Figure 4 (a-4)). The c -200 crystal 
planes are oriented at an angle close to ≈ 55° to the direction normal to coating/substrate interfaces (see Figure 4 (a-4)). Comparing 
the 2D x -ray diffractograms recorded at the end of deposition (see Figure 2 (a)) along with the HRTEM image (see  Figure 4 (a-4)) 
suggests, that from a tf of ≈ 2 nm, c -200 planes of TiN deposited with V s  = FP remains at an angle close to 55° to the GD. An 
intracolumnar grai n boundary is presented, see Figure 4 (a-5), indicating a distinct (see Figure 4 (a-4)) c-200 grains oriented in two 
different ψ-directions.  The red triangle indicates an area of the sample which has an amorphous -like structure. Unlike TiN deposited 
at V s = FP, the intercolumnar gap vanished in coatings deposited with V s = -40 V (see arrow marked region in Figure 4 (b-2)). We 
also noticed that at tf lower than 400 nm, a large density of nanocolumn’s growth is terminated (see arrow marked columns in 
Figure 4 (b-1)), beyond which a dense coating is seen. SAED patterns (see Figure 4 (b-3)) revealed a diffractogram corre sponding 
to the random orientation of crystal structure, corroborating our XRD pattern (see Figure 2 (c)). HRTEM image from the 
coating/substrate inte rfaces region further revealed a poor crystalline quality of the grains and their random orientation exist from 
the initial stages of the deposition onwards. Furthermore, we probed the intracolumnar grain boundary (see arrow marked in  Figure 
4 (b-5)), which suggests that the grain boundaries are sharp and crystalline .

Ex-situ microstructure of Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings [V s = FP, -40 V, and -80 V] are further studied using TEM (see  Figure 5). A 
nanocrystalline -like morphology is confirmed for Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings (see  Figure 5 a-1, b-1, and c -1)). While Al 0.67Ti0.33N 
coatings deposited with V s = -40 and -80 V are dense (se e  Figure 5 (b-1, and c -1)), an intercolumnar space is quite noticeable in 
coating deposited with V s = FP (se e Figure 5  (a-1)). The presence of both hexagonal and cubic phases is further confirmed by both 
HRTEM and SAED. Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings deposited with V s = FP and -40 V show the formation of hexagonal ph ases (see  Figure 5 
(a-2, a-3, b-2, b-3)). The formation of very small hexagonal and cubic domains is seen in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with V s = 
FP (see inset of  Figure 5 (a-2)). The interplanar spacing of 0. 267 nm is corresponding to h -0002 of Al 0.67Ti0.33N, which is aligned 
along IP direction ( see inset of  Figure 5 (a-2)) in agreement with our XRD (see Figure S -6 (a) of SI).  The region marked with a red 
rectangle is corresponding to the cubic domain with c -220 (d 220 = 0.155 nm) crystal planes aligned al ong the GD ( see inset of  Figure 
5 a-2)). . We also find that a distinct grain boundary between cubic and hexagonal phases exists along with a grain boundary between 
 
10 
 differently oriented cubic phases of Al 0.67Ti0.33N (see  Figure 5 (a-2)). SAED patterns along with the HRTEM, of Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating 
deposited with Vs=FP, suggest that the h -101̅    0, h-112̅0 and c -220 crystal planes are also oriented along the GD. This is in contrasts 
with the crystal orientation of AlxTi1-xN:x≤0.5, deposited at V s=FP, coatings, where 111 crystallographic planes of cubic AlxTi1-
xNare oriented along the GD. Based on this observations  we  conclude that the orientation of crystallographic orientation in AlxTi1-
xNalloys in polycrystalline thin film form is not only constrained by geometry of the deposition system but can be influenced  by the 
composition of the coatings too, especially in the compositions where mixed phases of crystals can form. Further inspection o f 
HRTEM images of Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating with V s = FP, near coating/substrate interface regions, suggests the presence of an  
amorphous -like region (see  Figure 5 a-4)).  
Similar to Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with V s = FP, for coating deposited with V s= -40 V, grain boundary between hexagonal 
and cubic phases are also seen (see  Figure 5 (b-2)). However, the region in between the grain boundaries (as depicted  between 
yellow lines  in Figure 5 (b-2)) is either an amorphous -like region or crystalline in which zone -axis is not aligned with the beam 
directions. Nevertheless, a cl ear presence of grain boundaries is noticed. The recorded SAED pattern for coating with V s = -40 V is 
a bit different than that of the coating with V s = FP. The diffraction intensities from hexagonal phases are faint compared to cubic 
phases (se e  Figure 5 b-3)), further corroborating our XRD findings (see Figure 2(p)). The dominant crystallographic orientations 
are no longer c -220 and h -112̅0, but rather c -200 along the GD. The faint h -112̅0 pattern appears along the in -plane (see  Figure 5 
(b-3)). HRTEM images recorded close to the interface of coating/substrate revealed the formation of small crystallites with an 
interplanar spacing of ≈  0.260 nm corresponding to interplanar spacing of h -0002 crystal planes of Al 0.67Ti0.33N, and they are o riented 
along the GD, further corroborating our XRD findings . 
In Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited at V s  = -80 V, our XRD data show a complete absence of hexagonal phases. However, the ex -situ 
SAED pattern revealed the presence of a very faint h -101̅    0 pattern with no preferential orientations (see  Figure 5 (c-5)). No 
detectable h -0002 or h -112̅0 signal is seen. A careful investigation of HRTEM images reveal that hexagonal phases are formed at 
the grain boundary region only. The fast -Fourier tran sformation (FFT) of the HRTEM image around a grain boundary (see the red 
squared area in  Figure 5 c-2)) shows the presence of h -101̅    0 spots (see spots aligned with circle denoted as 1 in Figure 5 c-3)). The 
FFT pattern (see Figure 5 c-4)) obtained from an individual grain (green squared area of  Figure 5 (c-4)) revealed a complete absence 
of any spots corresponding to the hexagona l phases. Thus, we conclude that for Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings deposited at higher V s  [e.g., -
80 and -100 V] , the hexagonal phase nucleates only at grain boundaries, but not in the bulk of the grains. Further, an HRTEM image 
taken at the interface between coatings and substrate revealed the formation of very small crystallites with c -200 crystal planes 
oriented a long the GD, and c -111 inclined with an angle of close to 45° (see  Figure 5 c-6)) [≈44° measured from XRD]. This 
observation establishes that the crystal planes of the coatings seen at very small film thickness (~2 -3 nm) retain their crystallographic 
orientation throughout the deposition.  
To further understand the temporal evolution (i.e., average grain size as a function of film thickness increases) of the abov e-discussed 
grain (also crystallite) sizes and their orientation (i.e., texture) during the thin film depositions, we analysed the line profiles and 
diffraction intensities of the recorded diffractograms. While the thickness -dependent evolution of x -ray diffractograms and their 
evolution along the GD is thoroughly discussed in the section SI. III of SI, we dedicate the next section to  the evolution of the 
grain/crystallite sizes.  
C. Temporal evolution of crystallite size (D hkl) 
Many film properties such as, film hardness and stress evolution strongly connect ed to the grain size of the coatings. Thus, here we 
evaluate the  temporal evolutions of crystallite size ( ⟨Dhkl⟩) of AlxTi1-xN with different V s along the GD (see Figure S -9 of SI ) as 
well as close to the IP direction (see Figure 6 (a-d)). For all compositions, the respective ranges of ψ values that are used for 
integrating the diffraction intensities to obtain the line profiles are mentioned on top of each figure (see Figure 6). While here we 
discuss the crystallite size evolution along the in-plane direction, details of the same along GDs are discussed in section SI. IV of 
SI. 
We find that a power -law like (see Eqn. 2) increase in average D 111 as film thickness increases is noticed for x = [0,0.5] in AlxTi1-
xN. Thin films of AlxTi1-xN:x= [0,0.5] deposited with V s=FP, shows a rapid increase in D 111 as tf increases as compared to films 
deposited with a finite applied V s (see Figure 6(a-c)). For example, a t tf ≈ 200 nm, D111IP of TiN deposited at V s = FP is estimated 
to ≈ 23 nm and increased to ≈ 38 nm at tf =1007 nm  while film deposited at Vs =-20 V at  the end of depositions ( tf ≈ 920 nm ) 
D111IP is estimated to ≈ 37 nm. With further increase in V s to -40, -60, -80, and -100 V, D111IP of TiN at the end of depositions are  
≈ 29 nm, ≈ 30 nm, ≈ 33 nm, and ≈ 33 nm, respectively ( see Figure 6 (a)). Similar behaviour on the evolution of  D111IP in Al0.25Ti0.75N 
and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating s is seen. Thin film of Al 0.25Ti0.75N deposited with V s = FP increases from ≈19 nm [ tf  ≈ 200 nm] to ≈41 
nm [tf ≈ 1631 nm] (see Figure 6 (b)). With V s = -20 V, D111IP is estimated to ≈ 23 nm at tf ≈ 200 nm and increases to ≈33 nm as  
11 
 tf  reaches to 1494 nm ( see Figure 6 (b)).  A similar evolution of D111IP is observed for V s = -40 V. At tf ≈ 200 nm, D111IP is 
estimated to ≈ 22 nm, while as tf reaches to 1494 nm, D111IP is ≈ 33 nm. Likewise, the texture evolution of Al0.25Ti0.75N at V s=-60 
V (see Figure S -9(b) of SI ), a discontinuity in evolution of D111IP is also observed at tf ≈ 770 nm ( see Figure 6 (b)). The D111IP at 
tf ≈ 200 nm is ≈ 24 nm, while at tf ≈ 770 nm it is estimated to be ≈ 27 nm in this case. Similar to Al 0.25Ti0.75N coatings the evolutions 
of D111IP vs. tf in Al0.50Ti0.50N coatings deposited with V s= -60 and -80 V show an abrupt change at tf ≈ 950 nm and 745 nm, 
respectively (see Figure 6 (c)). At tf ≈ 150 nm, D111IP of Al0.50Ti0.50N coating deposited at V s = -60 is estimated to ≈ 18 nm, while 
at tf ≈ 950 nm D111IP is 25 nm.  D111IP of Al0.50Ti0.50N coating deposited at V s = -80 V changes from 16 nm to 23 nm, as tf increases 
from ≈  150 nm to ≈ 1545 nm.  
 
Figure 6 (a-d) are the temporal evolution of crystallite size ( 𝐷ℎ𝑘𝑙) of AlxTi1-xNclose to in -plane direction. Thin film coatings are 
deposited on Si (100) substrate at various substrate bias voltages. The range of tilt angle (ψ) used to integrate the intensity of XRD 
patterns in transforming 2D XRD to 1D line -out are shown on top of eac h figure.   
The D111IP of Al0.67Ti0.33N coating s are estimated by integrating the diffraction intensit ies from c -111 crystal planes within the ψ 
ranges of 55-75° (see Figure 6 (d)). Al0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with V s = FP, estimated D111IP at tf ≈ 400 nm is ≈ 11 nm, which 
reduced to ≈ 9.5 nm at tf ≈ 1867 nm . Estimated D111IP of Al0.67Ti0.33N coating with V s = -20 V  is 10.5 nm  at all tf. The evolution 
of D111IP of Al0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with Vs = -40 V is a bit complex.  From tf ≈ 280 nm to ≈ 650 nm, a small increase in 
D111IP from 8.6  nm to 9.6 nm  is noticed . Beyond tf ≈ 650 nm, D111IP decreases to 8.6 nm and almost remains constant thereafter.  
With  Vs = -60 V, D111IP remains almost constant at 12.9  nm. The average D111IP of Al0.67Ti0.33N coating with V s = -60 V is again a 
bit complex. We observe between the tf ≈ 120-550 nm that D111IP increases from 11.4  nm to 17. 5 nm. Beyond tf ≈ 550 nm, D111IP 
decreases with an increase in tf, and at tf ≈1508 nm D111IP is estimated to be 16. 5 nm. The estimated D111IP of Al0.67Ti0.33N coating 
deposited with V s = -100 V  is 14 .5 nm at tf ≈ 500 nm , and it decreases to 13 nm at tf ≈ 1502 nm.  The evolution s of D111IP vs. tf 
for all samples are fitted with Eqn. 2, and the coefficients  (k) and exponents  (n) are tabulated in Table S -2 of SI .  
Next, to uncover the effect of compositions and substrate bias (and consequently the formation and evolution of different 
microstructures as discussed in previous sections) to the stress evolutions of the films, the temporal evolution of the thick ness 
averaged stress is determined (see section II and section SI. I of SI for details of evaluation method). As menti oned in section II, the 
film thickness, tf, averaged stress is modelled with different two numerical equations. Below we presented evolution of internal 
stress (determined from internal strain, see Method section) in TiN, Al 0.25Ti0.75N, Al 0.50Ti0.50N, and  Al0.67Ti0.33N in four different 
sub-sections of section IV.  
 
IV. EVOLUTION OF BIAXIAL STRAIN AND STRESS  
 
A. Titanium nitride (TiN)  
We determined both biaxial IP strain (𝜀𝛹=90°) and GD strain (𝜀𝛹=0°) using the diffractogram s from  c-111 crystal plane s of all 
coatings and  monitored their temporal evolution (see Fig ure S-11 of SI ). The biaxial stress  (𝜎) is shown in  Figure 7. The negative 
sign (-) in the strain /stress  value s indicate all TiN films are experiencing a compressive strain /stress . The positive (+)  sign during  
 
12 
 thin film deposition  represents  tensile strain/ stress . In these experiments , we could assess stress/strain from diffractogram s recorded 
for tf ≥ 200 nm only, due to too low intensity at lower thicknesses . 
Figure 7 is the biaxial stress  (⟨𝜎111⟩) evolution of TiN on Si (100)  substrate at different substrate bias voltages V s; at floating 
potential (a), -20 V (b), -40 V (c), -60 V (d), -80 V (e) , and -100 V (f).  Experimentally obtained data are fitted with a power law 
(Model  1, dashed  line) and a kinetic model (Model  2, solid lines ) as discussed in section II.  
For TiN, deposited at all V s, the final 𝜎 is always compressive. At tf ≈ 280 nm, 𝜎 of TiN coatings deposited at V s = FP, -20, -40, -
60, -80, and -100 V are  approximately  -0.8, -2.3, -4.5, -4.3, -3.0, and -2.5 GPa, respectively. At the very end of the deposition, the 
𝜎 (and tf) is estimated as -0.5 GPa (≈ 1007 nm ), -2.2 GPa (≈ 917 nm ), -4.2 GPa (≈ 920 nm ), -3.1 GPa (≈ 912 nm ), -2.2 GPa (≈ 930 
nm), and -2.0 GPa (≈ 895 nm ) for V s = FP, -20, -40, -60, -80, and -100 V , respectively. This suggests a “U” type behaviour of final  
values of  σ in TiN films with increase in V s. We use the power law (presented in Eqn. 3) to fit the σ vs. tf (see dashed lines  (Model 
1) in Figure 7). The fitted co -efficient and exponents for TiN coatings with varying V s are tabulated Table 2. It shows  that, t he 
parameter σ0, to which σ(tf) converge was found to be positive (0. 54 GPa) for coating deposited with V s = FP, while for coatings 
deposited with V s of -20, -40, -60, -80 and -100 V, the σ0 is negative  but have a U type dependence to the V s (see Table 2). The 
coefficient c, which is related to  the stress generated  or shrinkage by  grain boundar ies, [55,57]  is always a negative number. The 
values of γ are close to 0.20 with V s = FP, -20, and -40V and consistently increases with further increases in V s (see Table 2). We 
note that for TiN coatings deposited at V s = -20 and -40 V, the estimated stress in between 28 0-460 nm is a bit dispersed, suggesting 
a wider distribution of stress present in the coatings at such lower  tf.

The σ vs. tf of TiN coatings are further analysed within the kinetic model proposed by Chason et al.  [56], which is briefly discussed 
in section II. The σc and σT,0 (L =100 nm) are fixed at -0.02 and 0.67 GPa , respectively. The optimized coefficient s and exponents 
obtained by least -squares fitting of Eqn. 4 (shown as solid lines ( Model 2 ) in Figure 7) with the experimental data are tabulated in 
The value of βDeff, which measures the effective diffusivity of adatoms, is estimated to 47.6 nm2/s at V s = FP. With applied 
substrate bias [V s = -20 V to -40 V], βDeff increases by a factor of at least  two compar ed to FP. TiN films deposited with V s= -60 
to -100 V, βDeff is smaller compared to lower V s, but slightly increases with increase in |V s|. The value of 𝑙, which measure s the 
surface to the depth of defect  generated by  the energetics particle bombardments as well as the region of grain boundary  densification  
increases from 0. 21 nm (at V s = FP) to ~ 0.7 nm (at V s =-100 V ). The least -squares fitted value of A ,B, and D i is tabulated in Table 
3, in which, D i is the diffusivity of defects created in the bulk of coatings that diffused to the surface . The best fitted value s of Di 
have a non -linear dependence to V s and are 72.9, 23.7, 37.3, 75.1, 74.8, and 59.5 nm2/s at V s = FP, -20, -40, -60, -80, and -100 V , 
respectively.

 Figure 8 is the biaxial stress ( ⟨𝜎111⟩) evolution of Al 0.25Ti0.75N on Si (100) substrate at different substrate bias voltages V s; at floating 
potential (a), -20 V (b), -40 V (c), and -60 V  (d). Experimentally obtained data are fitted with a power law (Model -1, dashed line) 
and a kinetic model (Model -2, solid lines) as discussed in section II.   
 
The evolution s of 𝜎 vs 𝑡𝑓 in Al 0.25Ti0.75N coatings at different V s [FP, -20, -40, and -60 V] are shown in Figure 8. The IP -strain 
and IP interplanar spacing of Al 0.25Ti0.75N as a function of 𝑡𝑓 are provided in Figure S -12 of SI. At 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 250 nm, the  𝜎 is 
approximately -0.7, -1.6, -3.2, and -5.1 GPa for coatings deposited with V s = FP, -20, -40, and -60 V, respectively. For coatings 
deposited with the V s = FP, -20, and -40 V, 𝜎 reduces with the increase in 𝑡𝑓.  At the end of their deposition, the 𝜎 is estimated to 
-0.2, -1.2, and -2.9 GPa at V s =FP, -20, and -40 V, respectively , which sugges ts the increase in compressive stresses in the coating 
with -ve substrate bias. Similar to TiN, Al 0.25Ti0.75N coatings deposited with V s = -20 and -40 V, the value of 𝜎 is bit widespread. 
Unlike a smooth 𝜎 evolution of previously discussed TiN coatings, Al 0.25Ti0.75N with a V s of -60 V shows a discontinuity in it at 
𝑡𝑓 ≈ 770 nm, and 𝜎 changes from -4.94 GPa to -3.33 GPa (see Figure 8(d)). In the thickness region of 𝑡𝑓 ≥ 770 nm, 𝜎 vs. 𝑡𝑓 is 
fitted with Eqn. 7, where 𝜎0, c and 𝛾 are obtained as -4.28 GPa, -2.52 GPa nmγ and 0.2 respectively. The least -squared fitted value 
of 𝜎0 and c  from Eqn. 3 are tabulated in Table 2. A consistent increase in absolute value of 𝜎0 with increase in V s is noticed (see 
Table 2). The 𝛾 remain constant at 0.2 in all these three coatings (see Table 2).   
Least -square s fitting of 𝜎 vs. 𝑡𝑓 with Eqn.  4, with a fixed  σc = -0.02 GPa and σT,0 = 0.85 GPa at L 0=100 nm , revealed  that at V s 
= FP, βDeff is 81.4 nm2/s and increases more than two -fold upon substrate bias (V s = -20 and -40 V , see Table 3). Like TiN, in 
Al0.25Ti0.75N, the 𝑙 increases from 0. 43 nm to 0. 75 nm with an increase in V s from FP to -40 V  (see Table 3). By varying V s, the 
values of  A changed from -25.9 to -43.1, while B increase d from -27.8 GPa to -145.7  GPa, as Vs increases  from FP to -40 V  (see 
Table 3). The D𝑖 also increases with an increase in V s and changes from 48.9 to 68.4 nm2/s, as Vs changes from FP to -40 V  (see 
Table 3). As mentioned previously Al 0.25Ti0.75N coating deposited with V s= -60 V show s an abrupt change in stress at 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 770 nm, 
we analysed the stress evolution of the coating prior to this discontinuity . Least -square d fitting of σ vs. 𝑡𝑓in the given region  of the  
coating revealed a relatively smaller βDeff (≈ 76.6 nm2/s) than that of other samples  deposited with V s of -20 and -40 V  (see Table 
3).

 Unlike TiN and Al 0.25Ti0.75N, Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating  deposited with Vs = FP shows  average tensile stress in the coating beyond 𝑡𝑓 ≳ 
600 nm, while between 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 185 nm to 600 nm 𝜎 remains compressive (see Figure 9 (a)). At 𝑡𝑓 = 185 nm, the estimated σ is -0.5 
GPa, while σ shows a tensile nature and it reaches to 0.3  GPa at 𝑡𝑓 = 1640 nm. With negative potential V s, σ is compressive 
throughout 𝑡𝑓. The Al0.50Ti0.50N coating deposited at Vs = -20 V shows a relatively weak evolution of σ (see Figure 9 (b)). At 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 
250 nm, 𝜎 is estimated to ≈ -1.4 GPa, while σ converges to -1.1 GPa at 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 1545 nm. For the c oating deposited with V s = -40 V , 
we find a very strong stress relaxation between 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 180 -380 nm (see Figure 9 (c)). At 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 180 nm, estimated  𝜎 is -4.0 GPa, 
while at 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 380 nm 𝜎 is lowered down to -2.8 GPa. Similar to Al 0.25Ti0.75N coating deposited at V s = -60 V, there is a discontinuity 
in 𝜎 vs. 𝑡𝑓 of Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating at the same V s. At 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 950 -1000 nm, the 𝜎 changes from -4.1 GPa to -3.3 GPa (see Figure 9 
(d)). In this coating the estimated 𝜎 at 𝑡𝑓≈ 180 nm, is -6.5 GPa, while at 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 950 nm it is -4.2 GPa. Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating deposited 
at V s = -80 V shows almost a constant σ of -8.2 GPa for 170 nm ≲ 𝑡𝑓 ≲ 745 nm (see Figure 9 (e)). Beyond 𝑡𝑓 ≳ 745 nm, an 
abrupt change in 𝜎 vs. 𝑡𝑓 is observed . The σ evolution is fitted with Eqn. 3, and the coefficients and exponent are tabulated in 
Table 2. It is quite clear that the magnitude of converged stress  σ0, as well as  𝛾, increases with an increase in V s.  
 
Fitting of the kinetic model, Eqn. 4, to gain the evolution of σ, with σc = -0.02 GPa and σT,0= 0.85 GPa at L 0=100 nm, revealed 
the two to three  fold increase in  βDeff value upon V s= -20 and -40 V compared to V s = FP (see Table 3). Fitting of Eqn. 4 to σ  vs. 
𝑡𝑓, 200 nm ≲ 𝑡𝑓 ≲ 920 nm, of Al 0.50Ti0.50N with V s= -60 V, revealed βDeff to be much smaller than the coating deposited with 
Vs = FP (see Table 3). The value of 𝑙 increases consisitently from 0. 30 nm to 0.68 nm with an increase in V s from FP to -60 V. The 
optimized A [and B] are tabulated in Table 3, where a consistent increase in magnitude of A and B is s een with increase in |V s|. The 
best fitting of D𝑖 is obtained as  92.3, 49.7, 52.0,  and 75.0  nm2/s for V s = FP, -20 V, -40 V, and -60 V, respectively (see Table 3).   
 
D. Aluminium (67 at. %) titanium nitride (Al 0.67Ti0.33N) 
 
 
Figure 10 is the biaxial stress ( ⟨𝜎111⟩) evolution of Al 0.67Ti0.33N on Si (100) substrate at different substrate bias voltages V s; at 
floating potential (a), -20 V (b), -40 V (c), -60 V (d), -80 V (e) , and -100 V (f) . Experimentally obtained data are fitted with a power 
law (Model  1, dashed line) and a kinetic model (Model  2, solid lines) as discussed in section II.  
Unlike AlxTi1-xN: x ≤ 0.5, a wider distribution of 𝜎 values are observed in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings (see Figure 10). The Al 0.67Ti0.33N 
coating deposited with V s = FP shows a net tensile stress with very high values of stress distribution within the recorded 𝑡𝑓 (300 
nm ≲ 𝑡𝑓 ≲ 1870 nm) with a mean 𝜎 of 1.6 GPa. With an increase in 𝑡𝑓, a reduction in the amplitude of tensile stress is noticeable 
(see Figure 10 (a)). The Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating with V s = -20 V a net compressive stress is estimated and the magnitude of compressive 
 
16 
 stress increases with an increase in 𝑡𝑓 (see Figure 10 (b)). A similar 𝜎 evolution is observed in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings deposited 
with V s = -40 and -60 V (see Figure 10 (b-c)). The average 𝜎 recorded with Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating with V s= -40 V is ≈ -3.9 GPa. 
With V s = -60 V, the evolution of 𝜎 is relatively better resolved than that of other Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings (see Figure 10 (d)), and 𝜎 
increases with an increase in 𝑡𝑓. At 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 300 nm, the average 𝜎 is assessed to be ≈ -3.9 GPa, while 𝜎 is ≈ -4.2 GPa at 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 1615  
nm. The 𝜎 vs. 𝑡𝑓 in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating with V s= -80 V is a bit different from that of other coatings. It appears  that when 𝑡𝑓 in 
the range of 300 to 600 nm, the 𝜎 is increased from -6.4 GPa to -6.9 GPa (see Figure 10 (e)). Beyond 𝑡𝑓 ≈ 600 nm, 𝜎 consistently 
decreases with the increase in 𝑡𝑓. The Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with a V s =-100 V, the average  𝜎 remains around -6.8 GPa 
throughout the 𝑡𝑓 (i.e., 600 nm < 𝑡𝑓 < 1502  nm).  
To quantify  the evolution of 𝜎 with 𝑡𝑓, experimentally determined data are fitted with Eqn. 3 as Model 1 in Figure 10. The least -
squares optimized coefficients and exponent s of the power -law are tabulated in  Table 2 . The magnitude of 𝜎0 increases 
consistently with the increase in V s and changes from tensile to compressive as V s changes from FP to [ -20, -100] V (see  Table 2). 
Unlike AlxTi1-xN:x≤0.5, the least -squares optimized values of c obtained for Al 0.67Ti0.33N are positive and remain fixed at 3474.1  
GPa nmγ with 𝛾 = 1.29, 1.35, 1. 35, and 1. 58 for coatings deposited with V s = FP, -20 V, -40 V, and -60 V , respectively. As mentioned 
previously, the evolution of 𝜎 in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with V s= -80 V is different , and the optimized 𝜎0, c, and 𝛾 for the 
coating are -5.8 GPa, -6.1 GPa nmγ, and 0.25 respectively (see Figure 10 (e) and  Table 2).   
It is to note that the estimated D111IP of Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings are almost constant over 𝑡𝑓 (see Figure 6 (d)). Thus , in fitting Eqn.  4 
to mo del the evolution of σ in Al 0.67Ti0.33N we used D111ψ∈[45−55]o
 as L(tf) (see Figure S-9 (d)  of SI and Eqn. 4 ). The least squared 
optimized fitting parameters from Eqn. 4 are tabulated in  Table 3. Note that we have fixed σC = -0.02 GPa and best fitted value of 
σT,0 is = 2.5 GPa at L 0=100 nm.  The optimized  value  βDeff (50.1 nm2/s) for V s = FP and it increases with increase in V s (see 
Table 3). There is a consistent increase in  value of 𝑙  with an increase in V s and increases  from 0. 30 nm [V s = FP] to 0.8 nm [V s =-
60 V]. Coating deposited with  Vs = FP, the optimized A is -12.0 GPa, while B is very close to 0. The  optimized  magnitude of A 
[and B]  consistently increases with increase in |V s|. The best fitted D𝑖 is obtained as 89.9, 74.8, and 87.6 nm2/s for V s = -20, -40, 
and -60 V , respectively .
V.  DISCUSSION  
Mechanism of formation of texture or preferred orientation of crystal planes in TMNs polycrystalline films are intensely debated in 
the literature.  Broadly four different mechanisms are suggested: (i) minimization of overall energy  [strain energy  density , stopping 
energy, and surface free energy] , (ii) anisotropic ion channelling along different crystallographic orientation s, (iii) ratio of N to 
transition metals ( TMs ) at the surface of the substrate,  and (iv) mobility of the impinging atoms on the surface of the growing films  
[44,58,59] . Rafaja et al. [60] further suggested that preferred orientations can be influence d by the experimental geometry  too. 
Hultman et al . argued that because of the higher mobility of Ti -adatoms on on c -100 surface than c -111 surface [61] at pre -
coalescence  stage of islands, Ti  adatoms have a higher chance of moving off c -001 faceted islands compared to c -111 faceted islands  
leading to low growth rate of c -001 faceted islands.  But once the islands are coalesced , the effect is reversed , i.e., Ti adatoms will 
have more time to reside on c-111 surface s than c-001 surface s, thus the Ti adatoms capturing probability on c-111 surface is higher 
than on c-001 surface. Thus,  as deposition proceeds  c-111 oriented  grain s grow faster  than c-001 oriented  grains in a competitive 
growth mode that leads to c-111 preferred orientations  of the films . This explain s quite adequately  the acquired texture from XRD 
pattern s of TiN, Al 0.25Ti0.75N, and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating s deposited with Vs = FP, where c-111 is the preferred orientation .  
Change in the texture orientation upon application of substrate bias voltage has been intensely debated in the literature. Based on  
first-principles analysis, Gall et al. [62] showed  that  in presence of lower atomic N concentration , the diffusion length of Ti ad atoms 
on c-001 surfaces are comparatively higher than on c-111 surface s. While at higher atomic N environment , c-200 surface s will be 
covered with TiN x like cluster s, which  results into  a substantial  drop of diffusion length of adatoms. In such growth conditions the  
preferential growth of c-200 grain s take place . This partly explains the preferential orientation of our deposited TiN films with 
substrate bias, |V s| ≥ 20 V, where intensity of diffracted c-200 peak along the GD  increases with an increase in V s. While it is quite 
evident that in TiN, c-111 peak is always predominant along the GD  irrespective of Vs, a careful visualization of XRD pattern (see 
Figure 1) reveals that the intensity of c-200 pattern s is very strong close to the GD, but tilted ≈ 18°/22° away for coatings  deposited 
with Vs = -20, -40, and -60 V. We suspect such inclined texture of c-200 oriented grains is due to the geometry of the deposition 
process , where  the incidence angle of the  arc evaporated ions is at an angle of 35° to  the direction  substrate normal  [63]. Further more, 
the return of c-111 texture  from c-200 texture with higher V s [Vs=-80 V and -100 V ] could be the consequence of  the recrystallization 
of c-200 orientated grain s in to c-111 oriented grains as a consequent of secondary nucleation  [64]. Schell et al. suggest that different  
17 
 kinds of defects drive the recrystallization process  [65], which agrees  with the fact that higher substrate bias causes an increase in 
inciden t ion energy that can lead to the formation of high densit ies of surface  defects  as well as defects  in the bulk. 
Kinetics of adatoms in Al incorporated TiN is thoroughly investigated by Hultmann et al.  [61] using first -principles calculations. 
They suggested that Al adatoms have higher mobility on TiN(001) than on TiN(111)  surface s. However , because of a lower diffusion 
activation barrier of Al in TiN(111) than that of Ti limits the kinetic advantage of A l adatoms in development of c-111 texture.  The 
authors argued that incorporation of Al in the TiN(001) surface creates a trap state  for Ti near substitutional Al Ti site and Al at Al Ti 
site of TiN(111) . They proposed that in presence of Al Ti trap states the chemical potential advantage for formation of c-111 texture 
reduces. This agrees well with our observation for Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coatings . For a given Vs, diffraction intensity  from 
c-200 crystal plane is higher for Al0.50Ti0.50N than Al0.25Ti0.75N coatings . The continuous reduction  in the tilt angle of intense 
diffraction spots of c-200 crystal planes from the GD with increase in V s for TiN, Al0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N suggests that the  
kinetics of adatoms can overcome the geomet ry-introduced  constraints in the microstructure evolution.   
Presence of both cubic and hexagonal phases in Al 0.67Ti0.33N deposited with substrate bias V s = FP, -20, -40, and -60 V bias are in 
good  agreement with the results of theoretical estimations [36,37] , where for x ≈ 0.64 -74 both hexagonal and cubic phases can be 
formed. Daniel et al.  [66] demonstrated that beyond V s of -50 V, hexagonal phases become the minority and eventually vanish at 
further higher voltages, which agrees  with our experimental observations. The preferred orientation of h -101̅    0 crystal planes of 
Al0.67Ti0.33N deposited at V s = FP can be understood through considering texture formation in PVD coated polycrystalline h-AlN 
[67]. Jin et al. [67] suggested that in h-AlN there are two types of Al -N bonds available , namely B 1 and B 2. While bond B 1 is more 
covalent, B 2 is more ionic [67] and the bond energy of type -B2 is smaller than that of B 1, thus bond type B 2 is relatively easy to 
break. On the h-101̅    0 surfaces of h-AlN, only B 1 type bonds , while on h-0001 surfaces both B 1 and B 2 types are populated. Thus, 
with high energetics ion beams, the probability of survival of bond type B1 in AlN is higher than that of B2 type, indicating h-0001 
faceted grain s grow faster with high substrate bias. The first principles estimated surface fre e energy of h-AlN [68] suggests that 
the h-101̅    0 surface has lower surface free energy than that of h-0001 surfaces, suggesting with non -energetics ion beams the h-101̅    0 
surface will grow along the GD . Cheng et al.  [69] also suggested that for the development of closed packed surface planes (i.e . h-
0001 surfaces) adatoms need to stay a longer time at the surface than that of loosely packed surface (i.e . h-101̅    0). The preferred 
orientation of h-101̅    0 along the GD in Al0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited at  Vs = FP agrees with predictions of three different 
mechanisms as discussed above. With increase in |Vs|, together with breaking of B 2 type bonds along with the higher diffusivity of 
adatoms causes preferred orientation of h-0002 along the GD. The orientation of  c-111 and c -200 crystal planes of c -Al0.67Ti0.33N is 
a bit different than that of AlxTi1-xN; x ≤ 0.5. The intense spot of c -111 always remain s fixed at an angle of 42° to the GD, while for 
|Vs| ≥ 60 V, the intense spot in c-200 Debye -Scherrer  rings tilted away from 16° to 24° from the GD.   
The correlation between k and n, obtained by fitting the evolution of crystallite size, is estimated based on the Kendall rank 
correlation test [70]. The estimated p-values of k and n for individual compositions are .021, .083, .017, and .055 (.007) for TiN, 
Al0.25Ti0.75N, Al 0.50Ti0.50N, Al 0.67Ti0.33N (Al 0.67Ti0.33N: ψ∈ [45°-55°]), respectively. This suggests that a significant correlation 
between estimated k and n exists. We also checked Pearson’s correlation between k and n, where the magnitude of correlation 
coefficient is higher than 0.88, hinting to a strong linear correlation, indeed we find that there is a strong linear correlation between 
log(k) and n (see Figure S -9 of SI) [71]. In such case , Depla et al. [71] proposed that the power -law [Eqn. 2] need modifications,  
and the modified version of the power -law is given by;  
Dhkl
D0=(tf
t0)𝐧
      (5) 
where D0 and t0 are two constants. Fitting of D111IPvs. tf with Eqn. 5 revealed that the D0 and t0 values for all AlxTi1-xN are very 
close to each other, and the mean values are 13.43 ± 3.60 nm, and 12.41 ± 2.40 nm. Fitted D0 and t0for all AlxTi1-xN coatings at 
various V s are further tabulated in section SI.  IV of SI. The optimized n values are tabulated in Table 4. The value t0 approximates 
very close to the mean film thickness for continuous film formation [71–73]. Thus, here we argue that the critical thickness for 
which the arc evaporated AlxTi1-xN transitions from discrete islands to continuous films happens to be close  12.41 ± 2.40 nm.  
The homologous temperature , defined as the ratio of substrate temperature  (~ 450 °C  [~723 K] ) and m elting  temperature of materials  
(~29 49 °C [~ 3222 K]  [74], of our deposited films are close to 0. 22. At such low homologous temperature a substantial ly lower 
value of mean  growth exponent , n < 0.3 5, is often  observed [71] in agreement with our estimation . The n [from Eqn. 2 and Eqn. 5] 
is higher with film s deposited with V s = FP and lays between ≈ 0.25 to 0.4 . With V s, n reduces to ≈ 0.15 to ≈ 0.18 at -20 V and 
further increases to ≈ 0.23 at V s =-100 V  (see Table 4). This “U” shape of n vs Vs suggests a competitive growth mechanism , 
possibly a competition between nucleation rates caused  by energetics ion s, creation of defects , and diffusion of energetics adatoms  
[75]. A consistent increase in average grain size, 𝐷111𝐼𝑃, with an increase in film thickness is a consequence of grain coarsening,  
18 
 coalescence of smaller grains to larger grains, and grain growth below the surface of growing films , as the film thickness/growth 
duration increases  [76]. The nanocrystalline -like surface morphologies (see  Figure 3(p-u) and Figure 5(a-1, b-1, and c -1)) and 
evolution of grain size (see  Figure 6 (d) and Figure S -9 (d)  of SI ) of Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating s suggests that a frequent re -nucleation  of 
grains  occurs during the entire growth durations . Our TEM analysis indicat es that formation of hexagonal phases a round  the grain 
boundar ies is the reason behind the stagnation and , hence , the frequent re -nucleation of grains.

The g eneration of compressive stress in PVD coated thin films  is often observed . Among the many mechanisms, the insertion of 
atoms into the grain boundary has been gaining more credibility [56,77] . However,  in the deposition of coating s with high energetics 
vapour flux, stress can be caus ed by additional facto rs, too. A comprehensive model proposed by Chason et al.[56]  includes such 
factors [ e.g., boundary  coalescence, formation of the new grain boundar ies, and their de nsification and creation of defects in bulk 
of films ].   
In general,  it is seen here  that the βDeff, which  is a measure of effective diffusivity , increases with increase in V s. However, in our 
TiN coatings  βDeff shows a “U”  type behaviour  with increase in V s. This behaviour coincides with the “U” type character of the 
evolution  of the texture intensity ratio I c-200/Ic-111 (see Figure S -5  of SI).   The βDeff in Al0.25Ti0.75N, and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coating s 
deposited with Vs = FP is substantially lower than for coatings deposited with applied negative Vs [except for coatings with cohesive 
failure is seen] . This applied Vs influence s diffusivity  of adatoms , and it increases with an increase in ion energies. This agrees  with 
the fact that with increase in |V s| wider nanocolumnar  dense coatings are seen. The βD eff of TiN, Al 0.25Ti0.75N, and Al 0.50Ti0.50N is 
within the range of 47-210 nm2/s, much higher than that reported for different metals and TiN thin films deposited by magnetron 
sputtering  (βDeff = 0.12 nm2/s for TiN)  [30,78] . For “non -energetics” electrodeposited Ni and Cu samples the reported absolute 
values of  βDeff varied quite differ ently from that m entioned earlier.  Chason  et al. [79–81] reported βDeff to be around 174 nm2/s 
to 1761 nm2/s  in the same order as our predictions.  The fitted parameters A and B, for arc evaporated TiN, that we obtained from 
least-square s fitting , are in agreement with  different materials that are discusse d in the literature  [30,56,78] . The value of 𝑙 increases 
with an increase in V s further agree ing that with  an increase  in kinetic energy, ions can penetrate more into the bulk of thin films 
from the surface s. The obtained order of 𝑙 agrees with the ranges of the value predicted  [30]. We find that t he evolution of A and B 
with Vs is not necessarily  linear. In TiN coatings, t he magnitude of final stress level at the end of deposition is of  the “U” type with 
the Vs. This suggests that the A and B in the kinetic model may have a dependence on the texture/microstructure of the 
polycrystalline thin films  and do not nece ssarily increase with  an increase in the ion energ ies alone.  Interestingly, the evolution of 
A and B obtained from the least square fitting of stress evolution of Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N with different Vs are a bit different 
from TiN. In the case of Al 0.25Ti0.75N, values of both A and B increases with  an increase in Vs, except for V s=-60 V where a small 
decrease in A is noticed .  
No strong power -law type evolution of σ is observed in Al 0.50Ti0.50N deposited with Vs = -80 V, suggesting high ion energies  can 
create a large density of defects , including dislocations and twin boundaries  [82,83] , which can give rise to high stress state in the 
coating . At the same time high densities of surface defects can hinder  the mobility of adatoms , which adds to the already high σ to 
the films. This hypothesis is further tested for Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coatings deposited at Vs =-60 V , where the cohesive 
failure of films is seen . The βDeff  values for both these coatings are substantially lower than for the coatings deposited at Vs = -40 
V (see Table 3) suggesting low diffusivity of adatoms on surface may be one of the reasons for higher internal stress in the coating.   
The estimated values of diffusivity of defects , D𝑖,  generated in the bulk part of the materials are diverse in the literature.  For sputter -
deposited TiN , Mo, and  Cu, the D𝑖 is estimated, using the kinetic model as discussed in section III, around 9.87 nm2/s, 0.28 nm2/s 
and 5503.14 nm2/s [30,56,78] . Through numerical simulations , Pasianot et al. [84] and Starikov et al. [85] predict the value of D𝑖, 
~ 1260 nm2/s and 1010 nm2/s respectively.  Our predicted diffusivity D𝑖,  with TiN, Al 0.25Ti0.75N, and Al 0.50Ti0.50N are in the order of

 101-102 nm2/s. At this stage , we do not find any correlation between the Vs and D𝑖. Since no reports are available regarding the 
estimation of D𝑖 for arc evaporated coating s in the literature, we could not compare  our estimates  either . The cohesive failures in 
PVD coated films are well documented and are often attributed to high stress level, i.e., when the stress level is higher than the 
fracture toughness, the coating releases the excess strain energy through the formation of cracks i n the coating  [47]. 
The evolution of σ in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings is more scattered in comparison  to AlxTi1-xN; x ≤ 0.5. This  is a consequence of a larger 
stress distribution caused by finer grains , compositional fluctuations, and formation of mu lti-phase crystal structure  etc. High tensile 
stress in Al 0.67Ti0.33N deposited at V s = FP is possibly the consequence of very small grain size  (L) as tensile stress, σT, scales  as 
L−0.5. Through a detail ed molecular dynamics simulation of bcc metals, Thompson et al. [86] proposed that stress evolution is 
also dependent on surface morphology.  They found that when grains are well separated, and impinging energy of atoms is lower (~ 
5 eV) the stress is tensile , and it scales with reduced contact area between the islands.  Cross -sectional SEM  and TEM  suggest a 
“perpendicular edge ” like structure , indicating  that the surface morphology is the key behind th is tensile stress.  A flatter  surface  
morphology in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings deposited with different Vs along with the mechanisms of Eqn. 4  is responsible for compressive 
stress.  Unlike AlxTi1-xN; x≤0.5, in Al 0.67Ti0.33N stress increases with increase in tf (Vs = -20, -40, and -60 V) . The least -squared 
fitted c for Model 1 is the same for Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings for V s = FP, -20, -40, and -60 V , which is probably the consequence of 
similar crystallite sizes  (D111IP≈ 8-12 nm).  The origin of  the unusual ly small , but finite decrease in σ with the increase in tf in 
Al0.67Ti0.33N coatings deposited with V s = -80 V is unknown to us. We suggest such behaviour might have a  pure microstructure 
origin  or is the consequence of the formation of cubic phase crystal only . With  Vs = -100, the estimated  σ is almost constant, 
suggesting that formation of large densities of defects due to  energetic ions are dictating  the stress levels in the coatings. The fitted 
value of βDeff increase s with an increase in Vs from FP to -60 V suggesting  the net diffusivity of adatoms increases despite frequent 
re-nucleation . The value of A, B, and 𝑙 increases with  an increase in Vs, which agrees  with the suggestions made by Chason et al. 
[56]. The best -fitted value of B from the Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating deposited with V s = FP is obtained as 0, as at no  tf, 𝜎 is compressive. 
A value of D𝑖 ≈ 75-90 nm2/s is noted. As already discussed earlier , there are no reports in the literature for which D𝑖 values can be 
compared for arc evaporated films.   
In short, an effective compressive stress relaxation in AlxTi1-xN; x≤0.5 coatings with the increase in tf is seen, and it is a consequence 
of the average increase in crystallite size (also grain size ) at higher tf. An accumulation of compressive stress is observed in 
Al0.67Ti0.33N, where a substantial hexagonal phase is recorded . In absence  of hexagonal phases, a small but noticeable compressive 
stress relaxation is seen. Thus,  here we argue that stress relaxation in AlxTi1-xN coatings with increase in film thickness is a combined 
effect of grain growth  as well as the fraction of hexagonal phases in them .

As mentioned earlier , the cohesive failure of the coatings is attributed to a high-stress field in the coatings , and the critical stress at 
which it fails is characteristic of fracture toughness of the materials . In the thin film forms , it is difficult  to estimate the fracture 
toughness due to their small size and unreliable methods. Huang et al. [47] developed a method by using stored internal energy. In 
that proposed method , many polycrystalline thin film coatings  were deposited with varying thickness  and residual stress  (𝜎). The 
shortcoming of their work is the exact determination of the film thick ness, at which  the cracks form and propagate.  This shortcoming 
can be overcome by  in-situ measurements , such as utilized in the current work . Since from in-situ XRD data analysis , we can 
determine  critical residual stress (𝜎cr.) and critical film thickness ( hcr.) at which initiations and propagations of cracks occur  [i.e., 
location of  discontinuity in XRD peak intensity, crystallite size and stress evolution ]. For thin films , Huang et al. [47] appro ximated 
the plain strain fracture toughness (K IC) to elastic ally stored energy (G s) and critical stress and hcr. by the relation given below.

 Utilizing the values of σ and tf, at which discontinuity  in stress and diffraction intensity  evolution  happens and  using them as 𝜎cr. 
and h cr respectively in Eqn. ( 6), we estimate  the KIC and G s for samples , where cohesive failure is seen . The values  are tabulated in 
Table 5.
 
The estimated K IC values closely agree with the estimate of Mayrhofer et al. (KIC = 2.7 ± 0.3 MPa.m1/2 for Al 0.60 Ti0.40N [87] and 
3.5  ±  0.3 MPa.m1/2 for Al 0.46Ti0.54N [88]). The K IC estimated for Al 0.50Ti0.50N with  Vs = -80 V is a bit higher . A relatively higher 
KIC of Al 0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N than that of TiN [47,89]  agrees  with the theoretical prediction of Abrikosov et al. [90].  
VI. SUMMARY  
In summary, we investigate the real -time evolution of stress and microstructure of aluminium titanium  nitride ( AlxTi1-xN, 0.0  x  
0.67) thin films on Si (100) substrate during their deposition with a custom -designed cathodic arc deposition technique. The 
synchrotron -based 2 -dimensional in -situ x-ray diffractogram s of coatings are recorded during the depositions. The strain and biaxial 
stress are evaluated by utilizing sin2ψ method , and their evolution with film thicknesses is analysed within a kinetic model.  Line 
profile analysis is carried out to quantify the evolution of crystallite sizes and texture formation. Thorough ex -situ characterizations 
of the coatings were carried out using electron microscop ies tools. The main conclusions derived from this work are as follows.     
 
• While in coatings of AlxTi1-xN: x ≤ 0.5 long columnar morpholog ies are formed, where the  domain size of nanocolumns 
and the density  of coatings  increase with an increase in substrate bias voltage . Owing to higher adatoms ` effective 
diffusivity , Al0.67Ti0.33N coatings have nanocrystalline -like surface morphology.  The nanocrystalline -like surface 
morphology is driven by the re -nucleation of grains and is a consequence of the formation of mixed hexagonal and cubic 
phases.  
• At lower energy of incomings ions  (i.e., substrate at floating potential ), 111 crystal planes of cubic phases of AlxTi1-xN: x 
≤0.5 are preferentially oriented along the  growth direction  while in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coating 220 crystal planes of cubic phases 
and 101̅    0 and 112̅0 crystal  planes of hexagonal phases are oriented parallel to the interface of coatings and substrates. 
Irrespective of Al content in AlxTi1-xN coating s, an increase in ion energies  drives  200 crystal planes of cubic phases to 
preferentially orient  along/close the GD .   
• A power law -like evolution of crystallite s’ dimension along the in -plane direction  with film  thickness is observed. While 
for AlxTi1-xN:x≤0.5 coating s the exponent of the power is positive and lies between 0.15 and 0.4, the exponent for 
Al0.67Ti0.33N is within the range of ±  0.1. Analysis of the evolution of crystallite size vs. coating thickness revealed that in 
arc evaporated AlxTi1-xN coating s the critical thickness  of transformation from discrete islands to continuous films is 12.41  
± 2.40 nm.    
• The biaxial stress in AlxTi1-xN coating s follows a power law -like behaviour with thickness of thin film . The converged 
value of stress in AlxTi1-xN coating s deposited at floating potential substrate bias is always tensile , while they are 
compressive with the negative substrate bias voltages. In all AlxTi1-xN: x ≤0 .5 coatings a biaxial stress relaxation with 
increase in film thickness is observed , while in Al 0.67Ti0.33N coatings an increase in biaxial compressive stress with film 
thickness is observed.  Kinetic modelling analysis suggests that upon a negative substrate bias a two-to-three -fold increase 
in effective  diffusivity of adatoms  occurs . The length ion induced d ensification of grain boundar ies and to  the depth at 
which defects are being created increases from 0. 2-0.3 nm to 0 .7-0.8 nm, as the substrate bias changes from the floating 
potential to –100 V.    
• Based on their critical stress level at the critical film thickness  before fracture , the estimate d fracture toughness of 
Al0.25Ti0.75N and Al 0.50Ti0.50N coatings are in the 3.09 ± 0.1  MPa.m1/2 and [3.04 ± 0.1, 4.84 ± 0.13]  MPa.m1/2 respectively  
agreed well with estimation from other techniques reported in the literature .
