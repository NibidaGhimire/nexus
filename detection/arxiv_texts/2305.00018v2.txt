We argue that demanding a consistent cosmological history, including the absence of domain walls
and strongly interacting relics at the Peccei-Quinn scale, singles out two concrete realizations of
hadronic QCD axions as viable dark matter models. These realizations generally feature flavor-
violating axion couplings to Standard Model quarks that are unsuppressed at low energies. As a
consequence, experiments looking for flavor-violating hadronic processes involving the axion can be
sensitive probes of QCD axion dark matter models. In particular, we show that the NA62 and
KOTO experiments could detect the K→π+adecay for axions consistent with the observed dark
matter abundance via the post-inflationary misalignment mechanism.

I. INTRODUCTION
The QCD axion as a dark matter candidate has re-
ceived renewed attention in the past few years. Part of
its appeal is that it was invented not for the purpose of
providing the dark matter of the universe, but rather to
solve the strong CP problem by effectively promoting the
θQCD parameter to a dynamical field, that naturally re-
laxes to zero [1–4]. Serendipitously, it provides rich possi-
bilities for being produced with the right abundance to be
a good cold dark matter candidate, despite its small sub-
eV mass. Most minimally, it can be produced through
the misalignment mechanism, as the axion field at the on-
set of its cosmological evolution is not generally located

‡tianzhuo.xiao@mail.mcgill.caat the minimum of its potential [5–7]. If cosmological in-
flation occurs at a high scale above that of Peccei-Quinn
symmetry breaking, this scenario is completely predic-
tive and singles out a preferred value for the QCD axion
mass, thereby fixing the only continuous free parameter
of the theory.
The axion is also an appealing dark matter candidate
because of its prospects for direct detection, since a cer-
tain strength of couplings to standard model particles is
generically predicted. Exploiting this, an ever-growing
program of experimental searches [8], astrophysical ob-
servations [9], and cosmological probes [10] is underway
to look for this dark matter candidate. However, the de-
tails of the interactions of the axion with the different
SM species and their relative strength are model depen-
dent [11], which results in a large parameter space that
needs to be thoroughly tested.
The first and most minimal QCD axion model was
quickly ruled out because of its strong couplings to light
quarks, leading to unacceptably large neutral current
processes like J/Ψ→aγ[3, 4]. This led to the devel-
opment of “invisible” axion models, in which the cou-
plings to light quarks were naturally suppressed. There
exist two main variants: DFSZ models [12, 13], where the
axion couples to quarks and electrons; and KSVZ mod-
els [14, 15], in which the only SM states to which the
axion couples directly are gluons.
The KSVZ and DFSZ models are the main benchmarks
for QCD axion dark matter searches. In both scenarios,
the standard lore is that axions couple to hadrons in a
flavor-conserving way, via the interaction with their con-
stituent quarks and/or through the gluon coupling. In
this work, we argue that the existence of flavor-changing
axion couplings to quarks is well motivated by cosmo-
logical and model-building considerations. Given that
flavor-violating observables can test axion-hadron cou-
plings more than three orders of magnitude smaller than
flavor-conserving ones [16], their presence offers excellent
prospects to test the QCD axion dark matter paradigm.
In fact, as we will see, terrestrial high-energy physics ex-
periments like NA62 [17] and KOTO [18] have sensitiv-
ity to QCD axions with masses as small as ∼100µeV,
a range compatible with current dark matter abundancearXiv:2305.00018v2  [hep-ph]  26 Oct 20232
predictions in the post-inflationary misalignment mecha-
nism [19–22].
We start in Section II by reviewing the cosmology of
QCD axions, with emphasis on models that naturally
avoid the domain wall problem, and that of unwanted
relics involving the heavy exotic quarks of the KSVZ
models. In Section III we derive the new couplings of
axions to light quarks, induced by the mass mixing with
heavy quarks, that is required for depleting the forbid-
den relics. Section IV derives constraints on the effective
axion-quark couplings from various flavor-changing rare
decays, and effects of flavor-conserving interactions on
stellar evolution. In Section V we summarize and give
conclusions. Details of mixing angle computations and
their effect on unitarity of the CKM matrix are given in
the appendices.
II. QCD AXION DARK MATTER COSMOLOGY
There exist many different ways to realize the Peccei-
Quinn (PQ) mechanism, which give rise to models with
different particle content and QCD axions with different
properties. However, if the QCD axion is to make up the
observed dark matter of the universe, the strict require-
ment of a consistent cosmological history singles out a
few preferred models.
A. Domain wall number
Although other alternatives exist [23–31], the simplest
and most predictive scenario for the production of QCD
axion dark matter is the post-inflationary misalignment
mechanism [6]. In this paradigm, the U(1) PQ global
symmetry is spontaneously broken at the critical tem-
perature TPQ∼fPQ, which is assumed to be lower than
the reheating temperature of the universe. As a conse-
quence, the complex PQ field acquires a vacuum expec-
tation value ⟨|Φ|⟩ ∼ fPQin the radial direction, and a
phase that is uncorrelated in different causal patches of
the universe. That is, the value of the angular compo-
nent of the PQ field, the axion, is randomized on scales
larger than H−1(TPQ).
As the universe expands, different disconnected
patches enter the causal horizon giving rise to topologi-
cally protected configurations where the U(1) field winds
around the origin of its potential. These are global cosmic
strings, which are stable as long as the PQ symmetry re-
mains unbroken and the angular axion degree of freedom
does not have a potential. At a temperature around the
QCD phase transition, TQCD∼ΛQCD, nonperturbative
QCD effects generate a potential for the axion

and explicitly break the U(1) symmetry into a discrete
ZNDWgroup. If NDW>1, this symmetry breaking gener-atesNDWinequivalent, degenerate vacua, and thus leads
to the formation of domain walls between different re-
gions of space populating each of them. NDWis referred
to as the domain wall number of the model.
Hence, models with NDW>1 lead to stable domain
wall networks that are cosmologically unacceptable, as
their redshift scaling quickly leads them to dominate the
energy density of the universe. This rules out such mod-
els as viable QCD axion dark matter scenarios. Modi-
fications that can make the domain walls unstable can
potentially rescue NDW>1, but they are nontrivial to
successfully implement. The simplest possible solutions
of introducing a tilt in the axion potential that breaks
the degeneracy between the vacua [32, 33], or a bias
in the initial axion field distribution [33–35], have been
shown to be problematic [36–38]. Although other possi-
bilities have been proposed [39–44], the constructions are
far from minimal.
The potential in Eq. (1) in models with NDW= 1 fea-
ture a single vacuum. That said and due to the presence
of cosmic strings at the time when the axion potential
arises around the QCD phase transition, domain walls
form in this scenario too. However, the NDW= 1 case
is radically different because this string-domain wall net-
work is unstable and decays quickly after the axion po-
tential is generated [45]. This case is therefore free of the
aforementioned cosmological problem. We conclude that
only QCD axion models with NDW= 1 are viable dark
matter candidates, unless extensive modifications to the
axion theory or the cosmological history are postulated.
In particular, this disfavors DFSZ-type models,1which
have NDW= 6, and restricts KSVZ-type models to con-
tain a single exotic quark carrying PQ charge.
B. Dark matter density
QCD axion models have a single continuous free pa-
rameter, the scale of PQ symmetry breaking fPQ. It is
customary to define the axion decay constant as fa=
fPQ/NDW, so for models without a domain wall problem
fa=fPQand we can use them interchangeably. The
mass of the axion is determined by faand can be ex-
tracted from the potential in Eq. (1), leading to [49]
ma= 5.70×10−5eV1011GeV
fa
. (2)
The axion decay constant is thus the single parameter
that determines the energy density in axions produced
through the misalignment mechanism. Although calcu-
lating the contribution from the axion zero mode (or av-
erage initial misalignment) is straightforward, the decay
1One can couple the axion to a single generation of quarks to en-
sureNDW= 1, but in that case flavor-violating axion couplings
to quarks arise [46–48]. We leave the study of post-inflationary
axion DM possibilities in that scenario for future work.3

of the axion string-wall network releases a large amount
of energy in the form of mildly relativistic axions that
must also be accounted for. In fact, recent calculations
agree that this contribution to the axion relic abundance
dominates over the one coming from the zero mode [19–
22].
In order to determine the spectrum of axions pro-
duced from the decay of the string-wall network, one
must numerically track the evolution of the cosmic strings
from their formation at TPQ∼fato their decay at
TQCD∼ΛQCD. This is an extremely challenging prob-
lem due to the large hierarchy of scales between the size
of the strings ∼H−1(TPQ) and their typical relative sep-
aration ∼H−1(TQCD). The calculation has been done
by a number of groups using various numerical approx-
imations and extrapolations, leading to results in the
ma= 10−5−10−3eV range, with significant disper-
sion [19–22]. The preferred range of axion masses and
corresponding decay constants is summarized in Table I.
Thus, the requirement of matching the observed dark
matter abundance further restricts the QCD axion pa-
rameter space. Current calculational efforts point to
models with a decay constant in the fa= 5×109−
3×1011GeV range.
C. Exotic strongly interacting relics
In order for the PQ global symmetry to be anoma-
lous under QCD and thus solve the strong CP problem,
there must exist colored fermions chirally charged under
U(1)PQ, that transmit the anomaly. If such fermions are
the SM quarks, one obtains DFSZ-type models. If the
SM quarks are not charged under U(1)PQ, it is neces-
sary to introduce additional (heavy) colored states, lead-
ing to KSVZ-type or hadronic axion models. As men-
tioned above, avoiding the domain wall problem requires
dark matter models to have NDW= 1, and thus a sin-
gle PQ-charged strongly interacting fermion. This rules
out DFSZ models, under which all six SM quarks are
charged, so in what follows we focus on KSVZ scenarios.
Hadronic axion models with NDW= 1 feature a sin-
gle pair of heavy fermions ( QL, QR) which are vectorlikeunder the SM gauge groups but are chiral under U(1)PQ.
They must transform in the fundamental representation
ofSU(3)cand be a singlet under SU(2)Lto avoid higher
multiplicity, and thus the possible different models are
classified by their U(1)Ycharges.
In the early universe, these heavy fermions are pro-
duced in the thermal plasma through the strong interac-
tions. Depending on their gauge charges, they may form
stable charged or neutral exotic hadrons whose present
abundance is severely constrained by observations. In
order to avoid that, their interactions must allow a suf-
ficiently fast decay into SM states. The detailed analy-
sis of Ref. [50] concludes that the lifetimes ≲0.01 s are
needed for the heavy fermion decays to be compatible
with BBN and other cosmological processes. This can
only be achieved if their U(1)Ycharges allows them to
couple to SM states via operators of dimension ≤5, yield-
ing another selection criterion that further shrinks the
landscape of possible QCD axion dark matter models.
D. Summary: viable models
To summarize, we have argued that QCD axion models
must satisfy three requirements if the axion is to consti-
tute the dark matter:
1. They need NDW= 1 to avoid a domain wall prob-
lem.
2. Any new strongly interacting fermion requires
gauge charges allowing it to couple to SM states
with operators of dimension ≤5.
3. The axion decay constant must be in the range fa=
5×109−3×1011GeV to reproduce the observed
dark matter abundance via misalignment.
It is easy to see that these three conditions can only be
simultaneously satisfied in hadronic axion models with a
single additional heavy fermion in either of the SM gauge
group representations
KSVZ −I : (3,1,−1/3),or
KSVZ −II : (3 ,1,+2/3). (3)
The heavy vectorlike quarks are thus required to have
the same quantum numbers as the SM down-type or up-
type right-handed quarks. Since they are chirally charged
under U(1)PQ, their mass must arise from their interac-
tion with the complex PQ field. By normalizing the PQ
charge of Φ to be 1, we can take2∆χ=χL−χR= 1,
where χL/Ris the PQ charge of QL/R, and thus write
L ⊃yQΦ¯QLQR+ H.c.. (4)
2One could more generally consider ∆ χ=kand have the mass
ofQarise from a higher dimensional operator involving Φk, but
such complication does not lead to any qualitative difference.4
After PQ symmetry breaking, this term produces a mass
for the heavy quarks mQ=yQfa. As we now argue,
this is a predictive scenario that can lead to novel phe-
nomenology due to the interactions between the axion,
the heavy Q, and the SM quarks.
III. FLAVOR-VIOLATING QCD AXION DARK
MATTER
The discussion in the previous section has shown that
QCD axion dark matter models necessarily introduce
a heavy vector-like quark with SM right-handed quark
quantum numbers. Having the same quantum numbers,
mass mixing between the SM and the heavy quarks is
possible. As we argue next, mass mixing is in fact un-
avoidably induced by the operators necessary for Qdecay.
Let us consider the example of KSVZ-I; the case of
KSVZ-II is completely analogous under the exchanges
uR↔dR,H↔˜H. Depending on the PQ charge assign-
ment of the two chiral components of Q, four distinct
operators of dimension d≤4 are possible:
OM
4=Md¯QLdR, for ( χL, χR) = (0 ,−1),
OH
4=y1,dH¯dLQR,for ( χL, χR) = (1 ,0),

where λn,dare dimensionless couplings and Λ is a dimen-
sionful scale. However, after symmetry breaking, their
phenomenology is equivalent to the dimension-4 opera-
tors upon substituting λv2/Λ→Mandλ′f2
a/Λ→Mfor
the first two, or λfa/Λ→yfor the latter three. The only
relevant distinction arises from the different PQ charge
assignments, as we will see. For simplicity, in what fol-
lows we use the notation of the dimension-4 operators
but while noting that our results equally apply to the
dimension-5 ones with the aforementioned substitutions.
In the absence of a flavor symmetry, operators involv-
ing any of the three generations of SM quarks are pos-
sible, and thus the Yukawa couplings yand the massparameter Mshould be understood as vectors in fla-
vor space. After the Higgs and PQ scalar fields acquire
VEVs, all four operators induce mass mixing between the
heavy and the SM quarks. We will show that this mixing
can lead to flavor-violating axion-SM quark couplings.
Consider first the case of OΦ
4; the OΦ†
4operator is
completely analogous, as is OM
4, after the replacement
y2,d→Md. For simplicity, we assume the y2,dcouplings
to be defined in the mass basis of SM quarks, after the
unitary rotation associated with the CKM matrix has
been performed. After spontaneous breaking of the PQ
symmetry, the following 4 ×4 mass matrix arises:

where mq=yqv, with v= 174 GeV being the complex
Higgs VEV. The PQ VEV for NDW= 1 models is given
byfa=fPQ. Recall that the heavy quarks obtain their
masses at the scale of fa, and we can thus write mQ=
yQfafollowing Eq. (4). The axion phase in the mass
matrix in Eq. (7) has been removed by an appropriate
(anomalous) chiral rotation of the ( QL, QR) field.

straints require this correction to be small, implying
y2,dfa/mQ≪1. We thus henceforth assume that md≪
y2,dfa≪mQto simplify the analytic expressions.

IV. FLAVOR PHENOMENOLOGY
As discussed above, the mass mixing between the
heavy Qand the SM quarks introduces flavor-violating
axion couplings at low energies. Thus we expect that
processes like the decay K→πamay provide strong con-
traints on the QCD axion. In addition, the models under
consideration induce other flavor-violating processes not
involving the axion, and therefore independent of fa, that
we study first.
A. Flavor-violating Higgs couplings
Mixing with the heavy quark Qgives rise to new contri-
butions to the SM quark mass matrix that are not associ-
ated with the Higgs mechanism. Thus, unless the heavy
quark mixes with a single light mass eigenstate, flavor-
violating couplings of the Higgs boson to the SM quarks
arise. For example, in the model of Eq. (7) (KSVZ-I rep-
resentation and OΦ
4operator), the mixing angles for the
light left- and right-handed quarks amongst themselves6

While the left-handed mixing of light quarks is unitary to
leading order in the md/mQexpansion, that of the right-
handed quarks is not. Right-handed quarks can mix sig-
nificantly with the heavy Qstate, and deviations from
unitarity are only suppressed by ( y2,dfa/mQ)2. This has
no impact on unitarity of the CKM matrix, which is de-
termined solely by the left-handed mixing.

In the second line of Eq. (23) we have rewritten the Higgs
couplings in terms of ( CR

pression is valid as long as phases can be ignored. Flavor
changing neutral current processes constrain the ( CR

of the axion.
First, these couplings can induce radiative q→q′+γ

For the analogous transition s→dγ, the decay K→

of the dipole operator vanishes for on-shell photons. In-
stead one can consider the decay KS→π0e+e−. Using

Off-diagonal Higgs couplings also induce flavor-

The strongest limits on flavor-violating Higgs cou-

(left) and up-type quarks (right). Different colors represent different flavor combinations. Horizontal bounds arise from flavor-
violating Higgs couplings (this work; see Table II), and oblique ones correspond to flavor-violating meson decays involving the
axion (dashed lines show future projections) [16]. The region where the QCD axion can make up the observed dark matter
abundance [19–22] is white (see Table I), while the red shading shows the limit from SN1987a on the axion-gluon coupling [54].

we obtain the limits shown in the lower two columns of

B. Flavor-violating axion couplings
The interactions between the axion and the SM
fermions can be written in full generality as
L ⊃∂µa

where fistands for any lepton or quark species and the
axial and vector couplings cA,V

in flavor space. For the QCD axion dark matter models
under study, the only sizable couplings are those to right-
handed quarks,
cV
qq′=cA
qq′=1
2χR(CR
a)qq′; (32)
see Eq. (16). The bounds on the different flavor com-
binations of the couplings in Eq. (31) were exhaustively
studied in Ref. [16], and we base our analysis on those
results.Off-diagonal couplings ( q̸=q′), can most sensitively be
probed using flavor-violating hadron decays. The limits
oncV
qq′arise from two-body charged meson decays and
are typically stronger than those on cA
qq′. At present,
the most stringent limit out of all the flavor combina-
tions is cV
sd/fa≤3×10−12GeV−1, coming from charged
kaon decays, K+→π++a, as constrained by the E949
experiment [61]. The first run of the NA62 experiment
achieved a marginally weaker sensitivity [62], and the
limit is expected to improve by up to a factor of two in
the second run. In the neutral kaon version of the de-
cay,KL→π0+a, the KOTO experiment is expected
to achieve comparable, but somewhat weaker, sensitiv-
ity [63]. Charged DandBmeson decays [64–66] lead to
comparatively weaker bounds on the bs,bd, and cufla-
vor combinations. The tuandtccouplings can only be
constrained through their loop-level contribution to the
aforementioned decays, leading to bounds with large the-
oretical uncertainty. Ref. [16] gives a detailed discussion
of all the limits summarized above.
Flavor-conserving couplings are best tested through
their impact on stellar cooling processes. In particular,
axion emission from supernovae is sensitive to an effective
coupling to nucleons as described in Ref. [54]. The nu-
cleon coupling can be related to the axion-gluon and the
different cA
qqflavors by matching to the chiral Lagrangian
and taking into account QCD running effects [16, 48, 49].
If all cA
qq′≲0.1, the model-independent gluon contribu-
tion alone dominates in the effective nucleon coupling.
In this limit, the duration of the neutrino burst from
SN1987a results in a limit fa≲1.4×108GeV [54].
The results adapted to the parameter space of the QCD
axion models under study are presented in Fig. 3, in
terms of the axion mass (or, equivalently, its decay con-8
stant) and the absolute value of the CR
acoefficients. The
left panel shows the limits on down-type quark couplings,
while the right one presents those on up-type ones. Dif-
ferent colors correspond to different flavor combinations
and should be read independently of each other in the
absence of any assumption regarding the flavor structure
of the operators in Eqs. (5) and (6).
Being independent of fa, the limits on the flavor-
violating Higgs couplings appear as horizontal lines. For
the limits that are sensitive to the phase of CR
a, we show
the two extreme cases corresponding to real and complex
couplings, enforcing only the weakest one on |CR
a|. Con-
versely, the (flavor conserving) SN1987a limit acts on fa
independently of CR
afor the values CR
a≲0.1 of interest.
The rare meson (or top quark) decays constrain the
combination CR
a/fa. Current bounds are denoted by
solid lines and shaded colors, while projections are shown
with dashed lines. Out of all the flavor variations, Fig. 3
demonstrates that only for sdcan the bounds on flavor-
violating axion couplings access otherwise untested re-
gions of parameter space. However, for that flavor com-
bination, searches for K→π+adecay are sensitive tests
of the minimal KSVZ-I QCD axion dark matter model.
Saturating the limit on ( CR
a)sd, NA62 will probe QCD
axion masses as low as ∼100µeV, well into the range of
current dark matter predictions.
To put our results into perspective, Fig. 4 compares
this reach with that of experiments looking for dark
matter axions through their two-photon interaction with
strength gaγγ=Caγγαem/(2πfa). The yellow band in
this figure shows the range of photon couplings pop-
ulated by KSVZ and DFSZ models [50, 67], and the
red and orange lines show the values of Caγγfor the
two dark-matter-compatible constructions KSVZ-I and
KSVZ-II. The flavor-violating axion couplings to quarks
that arise in these two scenarios are independent of the
axion-photon coupling, and thus the rare-decay limits ap-
ply directly to fa(orma). The corresponding reach of
existing and projected searches is represented by differ-
ent line styles for the most sensitive flavor combination
in each case, and saturating the limits on CR
a.
Figure 4 highlights that, while no existing dedi-
cated axion experiment or astrophysical observation has
reached the KSVZ-I and -II lines in the 10 µeV≤ma≤
103µeV region, rare kaon decay experiments will soon
be sensitive to axion masses as small as 100 µeV. Inter-
estingly, searches for flavor-violating axion couplings can
more easily test the higher range of QCD axion dark mat-
ter masses, which is the most challenging one for axion
haloscope experiments due to the required cavity volumes
becoming too small. Therefore, our study constitutes a
way to test the QCD axion dark matter parameter space
that is complementary to existing direct detection efforts.

QCD axion models lie in the yellow band, with the two cos-

(KSVZ-II); see Eq. (3). The solid and dashed parts of these
lines respectively show the current and projected sensitivity

where the QCD axion can make up the observed dark mat-
ter abundance is unshaded (see Table I) [19–22] Also shown

ments [68–78] (blue) and astrophysical observations [79, 80]

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Hadronic axions provide an elegant solution to the
strong CP problem, while also providing an explanation
for the dark matter of the universe. In striking contrast
to other axion models, the KSVZ framework can avoid
the domain wall problem of early cosmology. An essen-
tial ingredient of these constructions is a heavy vectorlike
quark Q, which would constitute a dangerous stable relic
in its absence of couplings to the light quarks. These
new interactions are only possible in two concrete real-
izations of the KSVZ scenario, here denoted as KSVZ-I
and KSVZ-II, which unavoidably lead to mass mixing be-
tween the heavy Qand the SM quarks. Ultimately, this
induces chiral interactions of the axion with the light
quarks. In this work, we have studied the low-energy
phenomenology of these generally flavor-violating inter-
actions. Our main conclusion is that rare meson decay
experiments have sensitivity to dark matter axions in the
post-inflationary misalignment scenario, as can be seen
in Fig. 4.
After diagonalizing the quark squared-mass matrix,
the axion is found to couple derivatively to the SM quarks
with strength Cqq′/fa, for potentially off-diagonal inter-
actions with flavors qandq′. However, the mass mix-
ing also induces dimension-4 flavor-violating couplings of
the Higgs boson to qq′. The interaction strength is pro-
portional to Cqq′, allowing us to constrain this parame-
ter independently of fa. The strongest constraints arise9
from rare decays such as t→hc, hu and through its ef-
fect on meson-antimeson oscillations. Figure 3 shows the
corresponding limits and their interplay with the ones
involving the axion couplings.
Out of all the possible flavor variations, the coupling
to the sdcombination is found to be most promising.
Experiments like NA62 and KOTO are projected to reach
an exquisite precision in the branching ratio for the K→
π+arare decay (in its charged and neutral versions,
respectively). As an example, NA62 will be sensitive to
KSVZ-I QCD axions with masses as small as 100 µeV.
This is well inside the 10 −103µeVregion that state-of-
the-art calculations indentify as preferred for axions that
could make up the dark matter of the universe in the
post-inflationary misalignment mechanism. Excitingly,
the NA62 successor at CERN is expected to improve the
sensitivity to the K→π+abranching ratio by at least
another factor of two [63], and thus probe even lighter
QCD axions.
