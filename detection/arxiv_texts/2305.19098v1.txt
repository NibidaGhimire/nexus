Abstract:  
Powde r samples have been suggested as a pathway to fabricate isotropic magneto electric ( ME) 
materials which effectively only have a pseudoscalar or monopole ME response. We demonstrate 
that random distribution of ME grains alone  does not warrant isotropic ME response because the 
activati on of  a non -vanishing ME response requires a ME field cooling protocol which tends to 
induce preferred axes. We investigate the evolution of ME susceptibility in powder chromia 
samples for various ME field cooling protocols  both theoretically and experimentally . In 
particular, we work out the theoret ical expressions for ME susceptibility for powder Chromia in 
the framework of statistical  mechanics where  Boltzmann factors weigh the orientation of the Néel 
vector relative to the local orientation of the c-axis of a grain.  Previous approximations 
oversi mplified the thermodynamic nature of the annealing process giving rise to misleading 
conclusions on the role of the magnitude of the applied product of electric and magnetic fields on 
the ME response . In accordance  with our refined theory, a  strong depende nce of the functional 
form of α vs. T of Chromia powders on the ME field cooling protocol is observed. It shows that 
Chromia powder is not generically an isotropic ME effective  medium but provides a pathway to 
realize the elusive isotropic ME response.  Introduction : 
The magnetoelectric (ME) effect was first proposed by Landau and Lifshitz in 1958 [1]. In a linear 
ME medium , where time and spatial inversion symmetry are broken while their combined action 
leaves the system invariant , the magnetic H-field induces an electric polarization P according to 
𝐏i=αij𝐇j. Conversely,  magnetization , M, is induced by an applied  electric  E-field according to  
μ0𝐌i=αji𝐄j with αij being the ME tensor. The linear ME antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 has a  
rhombohedral unit cell and a magnetic point group 3̅′𝑚′. This symmetry allows  for a diagonal ME 
tensor with ME coupling terms  𝛼∥ and 𝛼⊥  for responses parallel and perpendicular to its trigonal 
crystal axis [2]. The Cr2O3 ME susceptibility tensor, 𝛼, can be decomposed into a trace free and a 
pseudoscalar component  according to:   
𝛼=(𝛼⊥00
0𝛼⊥0
00𝛼∥)=1
3(𝛼⊥−𝛼∥)(100
010
00−2)+𝜃(100
010
001)   (1) 
Here 𝜃=1
3(2𝛼⊥+𝛼∥) is a non -zero pseudoscalar component for Cr 2O3 [3-6]. In a modern view 
on magnetoelectricity, the ME susceptibility tensor is often considered in terms of multipolization.  
In the context of multipolization, the trace free tensor component is known as quadrupole and the 
pseudoscalar or axion piece is known as monopole contribution  [7]. The possibility of  a material 
with a non -zero axion piece was long debated mainly due to the notion of a Post constraint  [8], but 
later unambiguously confirmed to be present in Cr2O3 [9]. Once the presence of a non -zero axion 
piece was established, the search for a cubic ME crystal began where 𝛼⊥=𝛼∥. The isotropic ME 
response in a single crystal remained elusive . As an alternative  it has been suggested to use 
powders of ME single crystals with diagonal ME response, to create an effective medium with 
isotropic ME p roperties. Shtrikman and Treves point ed out that for a powder of a diagonal ME material with 𝛼∥
𝛼⊥>0 near the Néel temperature, TN, the ME response will be isotropic when ME 
annealing the powder in collinear applied electric an d magnetic fields  [10]. This led Veremchuck 
et al. to the conclusion that the ME effect in chromia powder samples is isotropic [11]. However, 
neither is 𝛼∥
𝛼⊥>0 fulfilled in chromia  or any known magn etoelectric  nor is the approach by 
Shtrikman and Treves a true thermodynamic theory which utilizes  thermal averaging . It thus fails 
to describe the proper dependence of the ME response of a powder on the magnitude of the applied 
fields during the ME annealing process. We show in this work that such a strong dependence exists 
and th at chromia powder is not a priory an isotropic ME effective medium.  
More recently , isotropic ME response gained new attention in the context of axion electrodynamics 
and the topological ME effect which can be realized in topological insulator (TI) materia ls [12]. 
Hence, it is desirable  to establish a deeper connection between axion dynamics in TIs and in 
topologically trivial ME insulators with the central question being whether it is possible to find a 
topologically trivial material which has only an axion piece ME response [13-15]. It is worth noting 
that the isotropic ME response in TIs with realistic disorder decays quickly over time .  In addition, 
the magnetic ordering temperature for magnetic TIs is very low ~ 15K  [16, 17] such as Cr -doped 
(Bi, Sb) 2Te3, making the investigation of the corresponding monopole response  near room 
temperature  in topologically trivial insulators even more attractive [18]. The unifying aspect of 
isotropic ME response in all material classes is the possibility to map the peculiar property of the 
constitutive equation onto a modified form of the Maxwell action. Maxwell’s field equations in 
electromagnetism are the Euler -Lagrange equations of the Maxwell action. For the case of 
isotropic ME materials,  the Lagrangian density contains  an additional term, θ𝐄.𝐁, which couples 
the E and B fields, via the axion field 𝜃. The Maxwell action  of such ME condensed matter systems  
is analogous to the action of axion field models in particle physics  [19, 20].  The archetypical ME antiferromagnet Cr 2O3 has a diagonal ME tensor. Hence, powder of Cr 2O3 
with randomly distributed orientation of the c-axis of individual grains is an ideal candidate to look 
for near room temperature isotropic ME response. There is a lot of work reported in literature for 
textured thin films and Cr 2O3 single crystal [21-25] but very little for the polycrystalline Cr 2O3 
powder. In 1962 Shtrikman et al.  observed the ME effect in highly compressed polycrystalline 
Cr2O3 powders [10]. Very few subsequent studies show that the hot pressed polycrystalline Cr 2O3 
powder gives ME response that is one -third of the Cr 2O3 single crystal [26, 27]. Shtrikman et al.  
also calculated the theoretical expressions of the ME susceptibility, 𝛼, for both parallel and 
perpendicular relative orientation of the applied electric and magnetic annealing fields.  However, 
their theory of ME annealing was based on the approximation that all grains will align their N éel 
vector in a way which minimizes their energy leaving out the thermodynami c aspect that excited 
states have a non -zero probability to be populated determine d by Boltzmann factors.  In our work 
we experimentally investigate the evolution of the ME susceptibility, α, in polycrystalline Cr2O3 
powders with different annealing field protocols  and compare the results with  an improved  
thermodynamic model of the ME susceptibilities .  By doing so , we show that ME annealing affects 
the functional form of the temperature dependence of the ME response which shows a pathway 
towards the realization of an isotropic ME effective medium.  
 
 
 
 
 Experiment:   
We used a highly compressed micron size polycrystalline Cr2O3 power sample which has a density 
5.21 g/cm3 comparable to that of single crystal i.e., 5.22 g/cm3. The sample was cut from the Cr2O3 
sputtering target (Kurt. J. Lesker company part number EJTCROX282A4 ) in the shape of a cub oid 
with dimensions of  5mm × 5mm × 2.5mm. The purpose of using micron size grains rather than 
submicron grains was to minimize parasitic  ferromagnetic contributions from  uncompensated 
spins at the surfaces of  crystallites, reported in the literature [10]. These parasitic moment s can be 
much larger than the ME induced moment and thus contribute to background and noise in 
characterizing the ME effect.  
A Quantum Design, Superconducting Quantum Interface Device (SQUID) MPMS -XL was used 
as a platform to apply H-fields  (range 0 to 5.57 ×106 A/m), provide temperature control and 
detection of the ME effect.  An external direct current (DC) power supply was used to apply the E-
field simultaneously with H-field while annealing the sample from 370 K ( T>>TN) to 20 K 
(T<<TN). The SQUID was used to measure the ME response of the polycrystalline Cr2O3 sample 
with the help of a self -implemented alternating current (AC) AC -SQUI D technique [28]. The AC 
technique has the advantage of being insensitive to any static magnetization b ackground from 
uncompensated moments which, in a DC measurement, can mask the small ME signal. Our AC 
technique uses an external AC power supply to apply a low frequency (1Hz) AC voltage across 
the electrodes of the sample which is kept stationary within t he center of the gradiometer pickup 
coil of the SQUID [29]. The AC electric field excitation is applied to the sample via copper wires 
which are attached to the surface and the bottom of the sample cuboid with the help of silver paste 
electrodes. The ME re sponse of the sample on the alternating applied E-field generates alternating 
magnetic flux which induces an AC voltage in the SQUID pickup coils.  The alternating output signal from the rear panel of MPMS -XL is fed into a lock -in amplifier (model SR830). The 
reference signal is provided by the AC power supply. Rather than measuring the signal of the x -
channel after establishing the phase relation which maximizes the signal, we use the lock -in 
amplifier in polar mode ( 𝑅,Θ) with (𝑥=𝑅 𝐶𝑜𝑠 Θ,𝑦=𝑅 𝑆𝑖𝑛 Θ). Measuring R makes the output 
independent of the relative phase between reference and input signal. The reason to do this is that 
after each parameter change, such as changes of the sample temperature, the phase between signal 
and reference changes unpredictably due t o the automatic reset the commercial SQUID sensor 
performs. At low frequencies, i.e., in the virtual absence of losses, R is an accurate measure for the 
ME susceptibility with the only caveat being that temperature dependent changes of the sign of 
the susc eptibility reveal themselves in R as reflection from the temperature axis rather than 
crossing of the temperature axis. The first harmonic of the R-signal is a linear function of the 
applied AC voltage amplitude in accordance with the linear ME effect. To further improve the 
signal -to-noise ratio we measure at each temperature the ME response for the five AC -voltage 
amplitudes of 70, 140, 210, 280, and 350 V. We code a LabVIEW program which records the 
average of twenty different readings of SQUID voltage f rom the lock-in amplifier in response of 
a particular AC -voltage applied across the sample. The magnetic response of the sample in terms 
of voltage, read from lock -in amplifier, is plotted as a function of E -field corresponding to five 
different AC -voltage  amplitudes.  From the relation μ0𝑴=𝛼𝑬 the slope of a linear best fit to the 
five isothermal data points provides the ME susceptibility at a given temperature.  In order to obtain 
a specific result which enables comparison of different samples we normali ze the lock -in signal 
with respect to the mass of the respective sample.  The schematic diagram of experimental setup is 
shown in Fig. 1 .

In polycrystalline Cr2O3 powder, the crystal ax es of the individual grains  are randomly oriented in 
space with rotational symmetry. The ME susceptibility tensor for the polycrystalline powder can 
be characterized by  a nine -component tensor  where 𝛼𝑖𝑗=𝛼𝑗𝑖. 
𝛼=(𝛼𝑥𝑥𝛼𝑥𝑦𝛼𝑥𝑧
𝛼𝑦𝑥𝛼𝑦𝑦𝛼𝑦𝑧
𝛼𝑧𝑥𝛼𝑧𝑦𝛼𝑧𝑧)     (2) 
When cooling the Cr2O3 powder sample in zero applied fields from above to below the Néel  
temperature , TN=307 K, the powder will have equal distribution of 180⁰ antiferromagnetic 
domains states, which means for each grain where the Néel vector points along the c-axis in 
positive direction there is a grain where the Né el vector points in the opposite direction. This gives  
rise to a net zero ME response. However, when E and H fields are simultaneously applied during 
the cooling process  from T>>TN to T<<TN, the degeneracy of the domain s is lifted , and a 
temperature  dependent ME response can be observed  below 307  K. Activation of tensor 
components depend s on the relative orientation of applied E and H fields  while cooling . Cooling 
of the polycrystalline Cr2O3 powder under the application of parallel E and H fields will only 
activate the diagonal components of ME susceptibility tensor  (2) [10]. Isotropic or pure 
pseudoscalar response is a special  case. As a necessary condition  it requires  parallel field annealing  
to eliminate off -diagonal elements in Eq. ( 2). However,  it requires  𝛼𝑥𝑥=𝛼𝑦𝑦=𝛼𝑧𝑧 in ad dition  
which is without further measures not the case . The o ff-diagonal components  𝛼𝑖𝑗 of the ME tensor  
(2) are activated when the polycrystalline Cr2O3 powder is cooled under the application of 
simultaneously applied perpendicular E and H fields  with 𝑬=𝐸0 𝑒⃑𝑖 and 𝑯=𝐻0 𝑒⃑𝑗.  
Measuring t he ME susceptibility response for the diagonal component 𝛼𝑧𝑧 requires  two steps . First 
the powder is ME annealed, i.e., cooled through TN in the presence of simultaneously applied 
parallel E and H fields both along 𝒛̂−axis. The 𝒛̂−axis is defined by the cylinder axis of the 
gradiometer pickup coils shown in Fig. 1 . This annealing protocol will only leave the diagonal 
components of the ME tensor (2) to be non -zero with 𝛼𝑥𝑥=𝛼𝑦𝑦≠𝛼𝑧𝑧.  In a second step, t he ME 
response  𝛼𝑧𝑧 is measured  by applying a low frequency (~1Hz  ) AC-voltage along the 𝒛̂−axis. 
For improved signal -to noise ratios the AC -voltage is applied with various amplitudes ranging  
between  70 V – 350 V with a step size of 70  V. In the  low frequency regime  ME response and AC 
excitation are in phase and  the first harmonic lock-in signal normalized to the mass of the 
respective sample is proportional to <𝛼𝑧𝑧> where <…> indicates that the integral susceptibility 
measurement averages over the distribution of random grain orientations of the sample . Because 
we perform the lo ck-in detection  in polar coordinates to avoid the need for a phase alignment,  we 
plot |<𝛼𝑧𝑧>|𝑣𝑠 𝑇 in Fig. 2 . The zero crossing of <𝛼𝑧𝑧> 𝑣𝑠 𝑇 manifests as touch ing of the 
temperature axis of the |<𝛼𝑧𝑧>|𝑣𝑠 𝑇  data. The zero-crossings temperatures for different E.H products are shown in  the inset of  Fig. 2 . There is a clear dependence of  the zero -crossing  
temperature  on the magnitude of the annealing field products. The dependence  of the zero -crossing 
temperatures on the  annealing field products is very significant because  it shows that the 
qualitative T-dependence of <𝛼𝑧𝑧> can be affected by the annealing protocol. This in turn hints 
at the possibility to achieve  isotropic  ME response . We will show in our more in-depth analysis  
below that  a zero -crossing at  around  168 K would indicate isotropic response.   
Figure 3  shows the  experimental findings of the  temperature dependent response for the off-
diagonal component, <𝛼𝑧𝑥> 𝑣𝑠 𝑇. Again, t he ME susceptibility response for the off -diagonal 
component <𝛼𝑧𝑥> can be obtained  in two steps,  first by cooling the powder through TN in the 
presence of simultaneously applied perpendicular E (along 𝒙̂−axis) and H (along 𝒛̂−axis) 
fields . The ME response for <𝛼𝑧𝑥> is then obtained by applying a low frequency  ~1Hz AC-
voltage  ranging 70V – 350 V with a step size of 70 V  along the 𝒙̂−axis. There is a clear increase 
in the magnitude of the ME susceptibilit ies with an increase in the annealing field product for both 
<𝛼𝑧𝑧> and <𝛼𝑧𝑥>. This evolution of ME susceptibility components for polycrystalline Cr 2O3 
powder  with annealing field products has been completely ignored in the previous study [10] and, 
to the  best of our knowledge,  has not been reported in the literature before . Below we  work out the 
refined theoretical expressions for the ME susceptibility components for polycrystalline Cr2O3 
powder  by incorporating the Boltzmann statistics.

 Thermodynamics of annealing and distribution average of ME response of Cr 2O3 powder  
A single crystal of Cr 2O3 can be in two degenerate single domain states. In a single domain state,  
the cr ystal is antiferromagnetically long range ordered with collinear alignment of the spins of the 
4 sublattices along the magnetic easy axis which  is the c-axis of the rhombohedral  crystal. The two 
degenerate states  are, hereafter called (+) and (–) states . They  are distinguished by opposite 
orientation of the corresponding N éel vector.  The 180⁰ single -domain states (+) and (−) of Cr2O3 
have respective ME response 𝛼+ and 𝛼−=−𝛼+, each defined by two independent coordinates 
for directions parallel ∥ and perpendicular ⊥ to the trigonal crystal axis.

In polycrystalline powder , the crystal axes of the grains are randomly oriented in space making the 
material invariant under rotation . The local coordinate system of a grain whose crystal axis is 
oriented at (θ, ϕ) as shown in Fig. 4 is defined by the orthonormal basis .

where the unit vector 𝒛̃ is pointing along the direction of the crystal line c-axis and vectors 𝒙̃, and 
𝒚̃ are in the plane perpendicular to the crystal axis.  The 𝐳̂−axis of the reference coordinate system 
is the axis of the gradiometer pickup coils. The 𝐱̂ and 𝐲̂−axis are arbitrary but fixed axes 
perpendicular to 𝐳̂−axis and each other.

The free energy of the grain allows for two ME coupling terms for applied E and H fields: 
ℱ𝑀𝐸±(𝜃,𝜙)=∓[𝛼⏊(𝑬.𝒙̃)(𝑯.𝒙̃)+𝛼⏊(𝑬.𝒚̃)(𝑯.𝒚̃)+𝛼∥(𝑬.𝒛̃)(𝑯.𝒛̃)]   (5) 
In general,  we can write the ME susceptibility in terms of ℱ𝑀𝐸: 
𝛼𝑖𝑗±(𝜃,𝜙)=−ℱ𝑀𝐸±
(𝐸𝑖𝐻𝑗)⁄         (6) 
where the diagonal  components for (+) domain are: 
{𝛼𝑥𝑥+=(𝛼∥𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜃+𝛼⏊𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜃)𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜙+𝛼⏊𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜙
𝛼𝑦𝑦+=(𝛼∥𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜃+𝛼⏊𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜃)𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜙+𝛼⏊𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜙

And the off -diagonal components for (+) domain are: 
{𝛼𝑥𝑦+=𝛼𝑦𝑥+=(𝛼∥−𝛼⏊)𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜃𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜙𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜙
𝛼𝑦𝑧+=𝛼𝑧𝑦+=(𝛼∥−𝛼⏊)𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜃𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜃𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜙
𝛼𝑧𝑥+=𝛼𝑥𝑧+=(𝛼∥−𝛼⏊)𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜃𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜃𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜙      (8) 
Let “n” be the total number of grains  within the sample , among which 𝑛+are in (+) domain state 
and 𝑛− are in (−) domain state such that. 
𝑛=𝑛++𝑛−     (9) 
Also assume  among those “ n” grains  δ𝑛+(𝜃,𝜙) and δ𝑛−(𝜃,𝜙) are infinitesimal small number of 
grains distributed among the two (+) and (–) domains, with c-axes within a small solid angle 
𝑑𝛺 around (θ, ϕ), where 𝑑𝛺=𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑑𝜃𝑑𝜙 . The value for 𝜃 goes from  0→𝜋2⁄ and 𝜙 goes 
from 0→2𝜋. One can express δ 𝑛+(𝜃,𝜙) and δ𝑛−(𝜃,𝜙) in terms of  𝑛+ and 𝑛− as 
𝛿𝑛±(𝜃,𝜙)=𝑛± 𝑑𝛺     (10) 
The probability of finding a grain in any of the particular  domain state  either (+) or (−) within 
𝑑𝛺 is  𝑝±(𝜃,𝜙)=𝛿𝑛±(𝜃,𝜙)
𝛿𝑛+(𝜃,𝜙)+𝛿𝑛−(𝜃,𝜙)       (11) 
with sum of probability equals to unity i.e.,  
𝑝+(𝜃,𝜙)+𝑝−(𝜃,𝜙)=1    (12)  
Substituting equation ( 10) in ( 11) results  
𝑝±(𝜃,𝜙)=𝑛±
𝑛±+𝑛±     (13) 
If 𝛼𝑖𝑗± is the ME susceptibility response of the 𝛿𝑛±(𝜃,𝜙) grains which lies within dΩ then the 
total ME susceptibility response  of all the grains within the solid angle 𝑑𝛺 i.e., 𝛼𝑖𝑗(𝜃,𝜙), is  
𝛼𝑖𝑗(𝜃,𝜙)=𝛼𝑖𝑗+𝑝+(𝜃,𝜙)+𝛼𝑖𝑗−𝑝−(𝜃,𝜙)                               (14) 
Here 𝑖 & 𝑗 are the directions in which ME susceptibility is measured. Using the condition  𝛼𝑖𝑗++
𝛼𝑖𝑗−=0, equation (14) becomes  
𝛼𝑖𝑗(𝜃,𝜙)=𝛼𝑖𝑗+(𝑝+(𝜃,𝜙)−𝑝−(𝜃,𝜙))     (15) 
Substituting 𝑝+(𝜃,𝜙) and 𝑝−(𝜃,𝜙) from equation (13), the equation  (15) can be rewritten as  
𝛼𝑖𝑗(𝜃,𝜙)=𝛼𝑖𝑗+(𝑛+
𝑛++𝑛−−𝑛−
𝑛++𝑛−)=𝛼𝑖𝑗+(𝑛+−𝑛−
𝑛++𝑛−)    (16) 
According to the Boltzmann statistics 𝑛− can be defined in terms of 𝑛+ as 
 𝑛−=𝑛+𝑒−2𝛼𝑘𝑙+𝐸𝑘𝐻𝑙
𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑁      (17) 
Here  𝑘 & 𝑙 are the directions in which E and H fields are applied during annealing the powder. 
Using equation (1 7) the equation (1 6) can be expressed as  𝛼𝑖𝑗(𝜃,𝜙)=𝛼𝑖𝑗+(𝑇)𝑇𝑎𝑛ℎ[𝛼𝑘𝑙+(𝑇𝑁−)𝐸𝑘𝐻𝑙𝑉
𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑁]   (18) 
The f ractions of + and – domains are determined during field cooling through 𝑇𝑁, where 𝑇𝑁− in 
(18) is the temperature just below the 𝑇𝑁. At 𝑇𝑁− the domain state of a grain is selected and 
freezes on cooling near TN. The average ME susceptibility response of the powder can be 
calculated  by the volume average.

According to the  Cauchy  mean value theorem there exists a unique value of θ where the hyperbolic 
tangent can be moved outside of the integral s. The Tanh -term introduce s temperature -dependent 
scaling factors 𝐶1 and 𝐶2. From experimental data of the temperature dependence of the parallel

approximation 𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜃′≈0 for 𝜃′≈𝜗
2≈𝜋
4  and for the integral between [ 𝜗,𝜋/2] one 
finds 𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜃′′≈−1 for 𝜃′′≈𝜋/2. Together with   𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁−)≫−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁−) this yields the  simple 
EzHz-dependence of  𝐶1 and 𝐶2  and thus  
〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=1
3(𝛼∥(𝑇)+2𝛼⊥(𝑇))[𝐶1−(𝐶1+𝐶2)𝐶𝑜𝑠3𝜗]−(𝐶1+𝐶2)𝛼⊥(𝑇)𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜗𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜗  . (24) The dependence of 〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 on the annealing field product  was neglected  in the  effective  T=0 
theory previous ly developed  by Shtrikman and Treves [10].  
To further simplify expression ( 24) we utilize  𝐶𝑜𝑠3𝜗 <<1 and 𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁−)≫−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁−).  From 
Eq.(22) we obtain   
𝐶𝑜𝑠𝜗=√−𝛼⊥(𝑇𝑁− )
√𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− )−𝛼⊥(𝑇𝑁− )≈√−𝛼⊥(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− ) 
such that  altogether  〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 simplifies into  
〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=1
3(𝛼∥(𝑇)+2𝛼⊥(𝑇))𝐶1−(𝐶1+𝐶2)𝛼⊥(𝑇)√−𝛼⊥(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− ) .  (25) 
The t heoretical  result for  〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 can be plotted for various  𝐄.𝐇 products when substituting  
functional forms for 𝛼∥(𝑇) and 𝛼⊥(𝑇). Although theoretically motivated functional forms are not 
known for 𝛼∥(𝑇) and 𝛼⊥(𝑇), we found phenomenological expressions motivated by the fact that 
the ME response functions have temperature dependencies which follow the product of magnetic 
susceptibility and T-dependence of the order parameter. They read.

from chromia single crystals ) [31].  
The theoretical plots for |<𝛼𝑧𝑧>| 𝑣𝑠 𝑇 for different E.H products are shown in Fig. 5. There is 
a clear increase in the magnitude of <𝛼𝑧𝑧> with annealing field products  as expected intuitively 
from the behavior of the ME response of Cr 2O3 single crystals [32] but neglected in the existing  
literature of Cr 2O3 powder . In addition , the inset of Fig. 5 displays the experimental values of zero 
crossing temperatures for <𝛼𝑧𝑧> (circles) for increas ing E.H product s. The zero crossing 
temperatures increase with decreasing field product strength but level off at around 110 K. This is 
consistent with the subsequent theoretical discussion which reveals that isotropic ME behavior 
would be associated with a zero crossing of  <𝛼𝑧𝑧>  at 168 K. This zero crossing temperature 
cannot be achieve via an annealing protocol and consistently, isotropic ME response cannot be 
achieved via an annealing  protocol for chromia powders.  
 
Field product dependence of the zero crossing temper ature of <𝜶𝒛𝒛>  vs. T 
The theoretical expression for the zero -crossing temperature as a function of E.H product  is 
calculated from  the condition  〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=0. Using equation (2 5) for 〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 and the 
phenomenological equations (2 6) and (2 7) for the parallel and perpendicular susceptibilities one 
obtains the E.H dependent theoretical expression for the zero -crossing temperatur e.

shortly below the phase transition  into the ordered phase . Here long range order is established on 
the order parameter no longer fluctuations .  Therefore, as expected, 𝑇𝑁−= 306.15 K  is a value 
slightly below the critical temperature  𝑇𝑁=307 K [26, 27] . 50 100 150 200 250 30001

Theoretical e xpression for the off -diagonal component <𝜶𝒛𝒙>: 
The ME response  <𝛼𝑧𝑥> can be obtained by first cooling the powder through TN by applying E 
field along 𝒙̂−axis and H field along 𝒛̂−axis and then measured by applying an AC E field 
along 𝒙̂−axis and detecting the magnetization response along the z-axis. The symmetry of the system predicts   〈𝛼𝑧𝑥(𝑇)〉=〈𝛼𝑥𝑧(𝑇)〉. The expression for the off -diagonal component 𝛼𝑧𝑥 is 
calculated by using equation (18) for 𝑖=𝑙=𝑧 & 𝑗=𝑘=𝑥 as:  
𝛼𝑧𝑥(𝜃,𝜙)=𝛼𝑧𝑥+(𝑇)𝑇𝑎𝑛ℎ[𝛼𝑧𝑥(𝑇𝑁−)𝐸𝑥𝐻𝑧𝑉

 Theoretical condition for pure monopole response in powder samples of ME Cr 2O3 
The potential isotropic  (monopole or axion)  response is a special case  given by  〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)〉=
〈𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)〉=〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 and 〈𝛼𝑖𝑗(𝑇)〉=0 for 𝑖≠𝑗.  
To derive a hypothetical condition for isotropic response we start by calculating the average of 
the sum of diagonal components  of (2) . 
 〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)+𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)+𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=1

From equations (1) & (2) t he trace of the tensor gives  
𝛼𝑥𝑥+𝛼𝑦𝑦+𝛼𝑧𝑧=𝛼∥+2𝛼⊥ .    (34) 
Substituting equation (3 4) in equation ( 33) yields  
〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)+𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)+𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=(𝛼∥+2𝛼⊥)∫𝑇𝑎𝑛ℎ[{𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁−)𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜃+𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁−)𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜃}𝐸𝑧𝐻𝑧𝑉
𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑁]𝑆𝑖𝑛𝜃𝑑𝜃𝜋/2
0. 
To evaluate the integral we use the equivalent steps applied for the derivation of 〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉, i.e. 
breaking the  𝜃-integral into two parts. Utilizing the Cauchy mean value theorem and the 
approximations 𝐶𝑜𝑠2𝜃′≈1/2 for 𝜃′≈𝜗
2≈𝜋
4   for the integral between [ 0,𝜗] and for the integral 
between [ 𝜗,𝜋/2] one finds 𝑆𝑖𝑛2𝜃′′≈1 for 𝜃′′≈𝜋/2. Together with  𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁−)≫−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁−) this 
yields the simple  
〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)〉+〈𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)〉+〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=(𝛼∥+2𝛼⊥)[𝐶1−(𝐶1+𝐶2)√−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− )] (35) 
The system  annealed along 𝑧̂−axis is isotropic in the 𝑥𝑦−plane. Thus,  
〈𝛼𝑥𝑥〉=〈𝛼𝑦𝑦〉⇒〈𝛼𝑥𝑥〉+〈𝛼𝑦𝑦〉+〈𝛼𝑧𝑧〉=2〈𝛼𝑥𝑥〉+〈𝛼𝑧𝑧〉   (36) Equation (3 6) with expression of 〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 from equation ( 25) yields the expression for 
〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)〉=〈𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)〉 
〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)〉=〈𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)〉=1
3(𝛼∥+2𝛼⊥)𝐶1−1
2(𝛼∥+𝛼⊥)(𝐶1+𝐶2)√−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− ) (37) 
Comparison of 〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)〉 and 〈𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)〉 with 〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉 from Eq. (25)  reveals that isotropic response 
necessarily requires 1
2(𝛼∥+𝛼⊥)(𝐶1+𝐶2)√−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− )=0 and (𝐶1+𝐶2)𝛼⊥(𝑇)√−𝛼⊥(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− )=0. 
Because 𝛼∥≠𝛼⊥ ∀ 𝑇<𝑇𝑁 and 𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )≠0 the expressions for isotropic ME response 
〈𝛼𝑥𝑥(𝑇)〉=〈𝛼𝑦𝑦(𝑇)〉=〈𝛼𝑧𝑧(𝑇)〉=1
3(𝛼∥+2𝛼⊥)𝐶1 cannot be achieved via an annealing 
protocol . Different experimental protocols including extremely slow cooling , rapid cooling across 
TN aiming at variation of 𝑇𝑁− were performed to minimize the √−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− ) term.  Although some 
miniscule change in 𝑇𝑁− and thus  √−𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− ) can be achieved  for rapid quenching toward less 
isotropic behavior ,  in general, for polycrystalline Cr2O3 powders when annealed  under parallel E 
and H field, the ratio is always 𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− )<0 and never zero  or larger zero . This contradicts the case 
of hypothetical isotropic ME response made in [10]. Hence isotropic or pure pseudoscalar ME 
response cannot be achieved by ME annealing  a polycrystalline Cr2O3 powder. We currently 
explore alternative  ways to start from single crystalline Chromia for the fabrication of an effective 
medium with pure pseudoscalar ME response. The work is in progress and will be reported 
elsewhere . 
In conclusion we provide strong experimental evidence  for the evolution of ME susceptibility in  
polycrystalline Cr2O3 powders with different annealing field protocols. Such dependencies are know n for chromia single crystals but ha ve not been investigated in powder samples. We 
determined  the expressions of ME susceptibilities and the condition  for isotropic (monopole, 
pseudoscalar or axion) behavior  in polycrystalline Cr2O3 powders by incorporating Boltzmann 
statistics . Our findings for the polycrystalline Cr 2O3 powders allow us to understand the complex 
variation of the temperature dependence of the diagonal and off -diagonal ME tensor elements 
under various ME annealing conditions. We conclude , in contrast to some claims in the literature , 
that pure pseudoscalar ME response cannot b e achieve d in Cr 2O3 powders when following ME 
annealing protocols which start in the paramagnetic phase and end, in the presence of any electric 
and magnetic field configuration, in the antiferromagnetically ordered phase of the grains. This is 
ultimately due to the fact  that 𝛼⏊(𝑇𝑁− )
𝛼∥(𝑇𝑁− )<0 . Alternative ways to utilize Cr 2O3 in order to realize 
effective media with pure pseudoscalar ME response are currently under investigation.
