Abstract
Improving road safety is hugely important with the number of deaths on the world's roads
remaining unacceptably high; an estimated 1.35 million people die each year (WHO, 2020).
Current practice for treating collision hotspots is almost always reactive: once a threshold level of
collisions has been exceeded during some predetermined observation period, treatment is applied
(e.g. road safety cameras). However, more recently, methodology has been developed to predict
collision counts at potential hotspots in future time periods, with a view to a more proactive
treatment of road safety hotspots. Dynamic linear models provide a exible framework for
predicting collisions and thus enabling such a proactive treatment. In this paper, we demonstrate
how such models can be used to capture both seasonal variability and spatial dependence in
time course collision rates at several locations. The model allows for within- and out-of-sample
forecasting for locations which are fully observed and for locations where some data are missing.
We illustrate our approach using collision rate data from 8 Trac Administration Zones in North
Florida, USA, and nd that the model provides a good description of the underlying process
and reasonable forecast accuracy.

1 Introduction
Every year the lives of approximately 1.3 million people are cut short as a result of a road trac
crash. Between 20 and 50 million more people suer non-fatal injuries, with many incurring a
disability as a result of their injury (WHO, 2020). Working with collision counts can introduce
issues of zero-ination, especially over short time-frames. By working with rates over zones, we
have the advantage of fewer zeros in the data set and upon removing these, we may treat the data as
continuous, which can be mathematically convenient in terms developing a tractable model. Most
road trac data are recorded sequentially over time and it is common for there to be dependencies
between each observation. Hence, it is necessary to account for these dependencies in the model
via a time-series model, such as a state-space model. The use of state-space models in road safety
analysis is relatively new and uncommon, though they provide advantages for prediction.
State-space models can be used for modelling univariate or multivariate time-series in the pres-
ence of non-stationarity, structural changes and irregular patterns (see e.g. Harvey, 1990, West
and Harrison, 2006). Time-series analysis typically begins with the formulation of a model that
accounts for temporal dependence, for example through auto-correlation, trend or seasonality. The
1arXiv:2302.00342v1  [stat.AP]  1 Feb 2023use of state-space models within a time-series setting allows for uncertainty quantication in both
the observation process and any dynamic variables that are not observed directly. Forecasting
therefore accounts for these dierent sources of uncertainty and, when inferences are made within
the Bayesian paradigm, additional parameter uncertainty. Throughout, we focus on a particular
class of state-space model within which the observation and system equations involve linear func-
tions of the latent process. Such models are known as dynamic linear models (DLMs, see e.g.
Petris et al., 2009, West and Harrison, 2006) and oer several practical benets over their non-
linear counterparts. Notably, they admit a tractable observed data likelihood function, allowing a
computationally ecient approach to inference and forecasting.
Gamerman and Migon (1993) give a list of hierarchical dynamic linear models (DLMs) used
for the state evolution, smoothing and ltering through the stages of the hierarchy. Although
state-space models and DLMs in particular, have been to date rarely exploited in the road safety
context (see e.g. Buddhavarapu, 2015, Fei et al., 2011), they have been ubiquitously applied in
environmental settings. For example, Lai et al. (2020) use a spatio-temporal model to forecast
sensor output consisting of temperature and humidity measurements at ve locations in North
East England. The signal is described using coupled dynamic linear models, with spatial eects
specied by a Gaussian process (GP). A related approach in the context of emissions data can be
found in Shaddick and Wakeeld (2002).
Our contribution is a joint spatio-temporal model of collision rates over multiple zones. A
DLM is used at the level of a single zone, and allows for seasonality via a single harmonic with
time-varying amplitude and phase parameters. We then account for spatial dependence at nearby
locations by adding a spatial Gaussian process to the system equation, thereby smoothing spatial
deviations from the underlying temporal process. The resulting model allows for both within- and
out-of-sample forecasting for locations which are fully observed and for locations at which some data
are missing. A Bayesian approach is used to infer both dynamic and static model components and
leverages the tractability of the observed data likelihood, which can be eciently computed via a
forward lter (see e.g. Carter and Kohn, 1994, Fr uhwirth-Schnatter, 1994). We apply the inference
scheme to a real data application consisting of monthly collision rate data from North Florida, USA
within xed Trac Administration Zones. We assess the assumption of a time-varying parameters
governing the seasonal component to each zone separately before considering a joint model of all
zones.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. A brief description of the data is given in
Section 2. The structure of the DLM for a single zone and joint zones is given in Section 3. In
Section 4 we outline the details of the Bayesian inference scheme, before considering the real data
application in Section 5. Conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
2 Data
We consider monthly collision rate data available from North Florida, USA within xed Trac
Administration Zones. There are 8 zones in which collision counts have been tracked and recorded
at multiple sites. The rate of collisions per zone was then calculated as the average number of
collisions across those sites in each month. For each zone we have 115 months of observations where
the most recent observations are from April 2014. Figure 1 shows the multiple data streams over
time for the dierent zones. For all zones, the monthly collision rates exhibit sinusoidal patterns over
a 12 month period. Histograms of the monthly collision rates suggest that a Gaussian observation
model may adequately describe the observation process. Through scatter plots, we determined that
there was clear temporal dependence between certain months in year tto yeart+ 1, precluding the
use of a simpler model with \month" as a xed eect. Furthermore, zones geographically closer
are more strongly correlated (see Figure 2).

33 Dynamic linear model (DLM)
State-space models build on the relatively simple dependence structure of a (rst order) Markov
chain (in that information about some state ticarried by all previous values of the chain up
to timeti 1is the same as that carried by ti 1alone). They are made of two main compo-
nents, observed data ( xt1;:::;xtn) and unobserved/latent states ( t0;:::;tn). Figure 3 shows the
evolution of a simple univariate state-space in which the continuous valued latent state process
ft0;t1;:::;ti 1;ti;:::gevolves according to a rst order Markov chain with transition density
(tijti 1). The continuous-valued observation process fxt1;xt2;:::;xti 1;xti;:::gis linked to the
latent state process at an arbitrary time tivia the density (xtijti); here it is assumed that the
observed data are conditionally independent given the latent states. The observable process fXtig
depends on the underlying, unobservable latent state process ftigand we can reasonably assume
that the observation Xtionly depends on the state of the system at the time the measurement is
taken,ti. It remains that we specify the relationship between Xtiandti, and between tiand
ti 1. In each case, we adopt linear relationships, and further assume that the errors in the state
and observed components are independent and normally distributed. This structure leads to a
dynamic linear model (DLM), given by the following equations:
Observation Equation : Xti=Ftiti+ti
System Equation : ti=Gtiti 1+!ti
Here,Xtiis a scalar, tiis ap1 vector,Ftiis a 1pvector,Gtiis appmatrix and ti
N(0;Vti) and!tiN(0;Wti) are independent white noise processes with known variance matrices Vt
andWt, typically assumed to be constant. Assuming that the initial latent state follows a Gaussian
distribution gives
0N(m0;C0)
tijti 1N(Gtiti 1;Wti)
XtijtiN(Ftiti;Vti)
for suitably chosen hyperparameters m0andC0. In what follows we consider a DLM appropriate
for data at a single zone, before considering a joint model over all zones.

3.1 Zone specic model
The data set described in Section 2 showed seasonality in that, over all zones there was a clear
sinusoidal pattern about the rate of collisions over a year. Therefore, to account for this within the
DLM we include a single harmonic. Note that it is possible to account for seasonality through the
inclusion of multiple harmonics in the system equation (see e.g. Petris et al., 2009), however, we
nd that using a single harmonic and allowing the amplitude and phase to vary over time, provides
a parsimonious modelling approach.
4Consider rst a single location. We assume constant variance matrices VandWand data at
irregularly spaced times t1;t2;:::;tn. The observation equation is
Xti=Ftiti+ti; tiindepN(0;V); (1)

We impose some smoothness in these dynamic parameters by taking the system equation to be of
the form
ti=ti 1+kti!ti; !tiindepN(0;W)
which has been further altered to allow for measurements that are irregularly spaced on a temporal
grid. That is, we include a coecient, kti, in the variance in the state equation such that k2
ti=ti 

~1;tiand phase ~2;tivary according to two transformed independent random walk processes.
3.2 Joint model over zones
We now consider a model of monthly collision rates that captures both the seasonality, and ad-
ditionally, the correlation between nearby zones. Let Xti= (X1

of monthly collision rates at time tiwithXj
ticorresponding to zone j, andj= 1;:::;nz. In Sec-
tion 5.1 we nd that amplitude and phase are plausibly constant for each zone. Therefore, for ease
of notation, we x 1;ti=1and2;ti=2in what follows. The model at zone jis

We impose smoothness by taking a squared exponential kernel for the covariance function. Hence,
the covariance between spatial errors at locations jandj0is

4 Bayesian inference
For simplicity, suppose we have nzzones withnobservations in each zone. Let V= (V1;:::;Vnz)T
andW= (W1;W2;:::;Wnz)T. Furthermore, let 3= (3;3)Tdenote the hyperparameters
governingf3(), with1= (1;1)Tand2= (2;2)Tdenoting the hyperparameters governing
f1() andf2() respectively. Let xj= (xj
t1;:::;xj
tn)Tdenote the vector of collision rates at site j
so thatx= (x1;:::;xnz) denotes the complete data set over all zones. The joint posterior over all
dynamic and static parameters is proportional to the marginal static parameter posterior multiplied
by the conditional posterior of the dynamic process 3= (3;t0;:::; 3;tn) such that
(1;2;V;W; 1;2;3;3jx)/
(1;2;V;W; 1;2;3jx)(3j1;2;V;W; 1;2;3;x):
Let denote all xed model parameters. To simulate realisations from the joint posterior we use
a two step approach:
1. Simulate from the marginal posterior  ( jx).
2. Simulate from the conditional posterior 3(3j ;x).
For step 1, as the marginal static parameter posterior is intractable, we use Markov chain Monte
Carlo (see e.g. Gilks et al., 1995). For step 2 we use a forward lter backward sampling algorithm
(see e.g. West and Harrison, 2006) to directly draw from (3j ;x). We provide details as follows.
4.1 Simulation based inference
Let3;t0:n= (3;t0;3;t1;:::; 3;tn) denote the collection of latent states up to time tnand letx=
xt1:n= (xt1;:::;xtn) denote the observed data. Note that 3;ti= (1
3;ti;:::;nz
3;ti)Tandxti=
(x1
ti;:::;xnz
ti)T. Upon assuming an independent prior specication for the constituent terms of  ,
Bayesian inference may proceed as follows. Integrating out the dynamic parameters, gives us the
marginal posterior:

i=1(xti+1jxt1:i;1;2;3;V;W ) (5)
6and whose constituent terms are analytically tractable. Moreover, (1j1) =N(1;m1;K1) and
(2j2) =N(2;m2;K2) are multivariate normal densities, (Vj) and(Wj) are the prior densities
ascribed to VjandWj,(1),(2) and(3) are the prior densities ascribed to 1,2and3.
The marginal likelihood can be eciently evaluated using a forward lter. It will be helpful

(2009) (see also Carter and Kohn, 1994, Fr uhwirth-Schnatter, 1994, West and Harrison, 2006) for
further details.
Although the marginal likelihood is tractable, the posterior will typically be unavailable in
closed form. Hence we use Metropolis-Hastings to generate draws from ( j~x); see Algorithm 2.

Missing observations are commonplace, that is, only observations on a subset of components of Xt

where thenobsnzincidence matrix Ptidetermines which components are observed at time ti(Lai

84.2 Within-sample predictive density
In order to assess model t, we consider the within-sample predictive density. The within-sample
predictive density is given by
(^xt1:njxt1:n) =Z Z
(^xt1:nj3;t1:n; )(3;t1:n; jxt1:n)d3;t1:nd 
where
(3;t1:n; jxt1:n) =(3;t1:nj ;xt1:n)( jxt1:n):
Although the within-sample predictive density is intractable, draws from (3;t1:n; jxt1:n) are read-
ily available and therefore (^xt1:njxt1:n) can be obtained via Monte Carlo. Given draws (  (r);(r)

^X(r);j

3;ti) denotes the rth sample of j
ti, with ^X(r);j
tidened similarly. Draws
obtained from (7) can be summarised (e.g. via the mean, upper and lower quantiles) and bench-
marked against the observed data.
4.3 k-step ahead prediction
The system and observation forecast distributions can be obtained by exploiting the linear Gaussian
structure of the DLM. The one-step ahead system forecast density is given by
(3;tn+1jxt1:n) =Z Z
(3;tn+1j3;tn; ;xt1:n)(3;tnj ;xt1:n)( jxt1:n)d3;tnd

(3;tn+1j ;xt1:n)( jxt1:n)d 
where
(3;tn+1j ;xt1:n) =N(3;tn+1;mtn;Ctn+~Wtn+1):
Similarly, the one-step ahead observation forecast density is given by
(xtn+1jxt1:n) =Z
(xtn+1j ;xt1:n)( jxt1:n)d 
where
(xtn+1j ;xt1:n) =N(xtn+1;mtn;Ctn+~Wtn+1+V):
Hence, given Nposterior summaries ( m(r)
tn;C(r)
tn);r= 1;:::;N from(3;tnj ;xt1:n) and (r)from
( jxt1:n), the one-step ahead state and observation forecast distributions can be sampled via Monte
Carlo, by drawing

95 Application
In what follows, and where required, we implement the MCMC scheme from Section 4 by taking a
random walk proposal with Gaussian innovations. We have that q( j ) =N( ; ;) where the
innovation matrix  = dVar( jx), withdVar( jx) obtained from a pilot run and is chosen to give
an acceptance rate of around 25% (Roberts and Rosenthal, 2001). Within the MCMC scheme, for
mathematical convenience, we will work with precisions so that V= 1=V;W= 1=W. Moreover,
for parameter vectors whose components must be strictly positive (i.e. V;W; ) we implement the
proposal on the log scale.
5.1 Single zone analysis
In this section we assess the assumption that amplitude and phase vary with time. We present
results for zone 4 and note similar ndings (namely that amplitude and phase are plausibly constant)
for the remaining zones.
For the single zone model,  = (V;W1;W2;W3)0is the vector of precision parameters. We
set the mean and variance of t0to bem0= (1:5;1:5;6) andC0= diagf1:5;1:5;20grespec-
tively. We take an uninformative and independent prior specication for the components of  , via
V;W1;W2;W3Ga(0:1;0:1). The MCMC scheme was run for 22k iterations with the rst 2k
iterations discarded as burn-in, leaving 20k iterations on which to base posterior summaries.
The marginal MH scheme gives the estimated marginal posterior densities for the components
of shown in Figure 4 with their prior densities overlaid. The  samples were thinned to obtain 1k
(near uncorrelated) draws form the marginal parameter posterior, denoted f (r)g1000
r=1. The FFBS
algorithm was then executed for each  (r), to obtain samples of the dynamic parameter vector,
f(r)
tig1000
r=1,i= 1;:::;n , from the within-sample predictive. Samples of the dynamic components
1;tiand2;tican be transformed via (3) to obtain phase and amplitude draws from their respec-
tive within-sample predictive densities; see Section 4.2 for further details regarding the method
for obtaining samples from these predictive distributions. These distributions are summarised in
Figure 5 via their means and 95% credible intervals. We can conclude that, upon allowing for
the uncertainty in amplitude and phase, they are are plausibly constant over time for this zone.
Performing the analysis on the remaining zones shows that the same conclusions can be drawn.
This suggests that the dynamic parameters 1;tiand2;ti,i= 1;:::;n , can reasonably be replaced
with static parameters 1and2.
We assess the validity of the proposed model for a single zone by comparing observed data
with their model-based within-sample posterior predictive distributions and with model-based out-
of-sample forecast distributions. For the latter, we withheld the last 10 observations when tting
the model. Figure 6 shows the within-sample predictive distribution for the observation process,
summarised by the mean and 95% credible interval calculated for each time point. This suggests
that the model is able to reasonably account for the observation process. Similarly, the 10-step
ahead forecast distribution is summarised by the mean and 95% credible interval at each time
point. We see that the forecast distribution is able to capture the general trend exhibited by the
observations.

5.2 Joint zone analysis
We now consider the joint model over all zones detailed in Section 3.2. Our prior specication takes
the following form.
We expect that amplitude and phase should be similar at nearby zones. Recall that 1
GP(m1();f1(;1)),2GP(m2();f2(;2)) and the Gaussian process components in the dynamic
mean process are ptiindepGPf0;f3(;3)g. We take the mean functions to be constant so that
m1() =m2() = 1:51, with 1dened as an nz1 vector of 1s. We have that fk(djj0;k) =
2
kexp( kdjj0),k= 1;2;3. We take log kindepN(log(0:1);0:1) representing fairly strong prior
beliefs about the amplitude variance and phase within a zone. For the logarithm of the inverse length
scales, we take log kN(log(0:1);0:1) giving typical length scales of around 10km, reecting
typical distances between zones. The precisions of the observation equations governing each zone are
VjindepGa(0:1;0:1) and similarly for the system variances, WjindepGa(0:1;0:1),j= 1;:::;nz.
Finally, the initial values j
3;t0for each site were assumed to follow N(6;20) distributions.
The MCMC scheme was run for 1 106iterations; the output is summarised by Table 1. Figure 7
shows the mean value and 95% credible interval of the posterior densities for amplitude and phase
at each zone against longitude. There are signs of spatial dependence as the phase seems to decrease
and amplitude increases in zones further to the east. Figure 8 shows a single period of the sine
curve, averaged over draws of amplitude and phase for the most eastern versus most western zone
with 95% credible intervals. From this we would expect to see more pronounced uctuations in the
rate of collisions across the year for eastern zones. Furthermore, we would expect the highest rate of
collisions to be a month sooner (August) in eastern zones than that in western zones (September).
Figure 9 shows summaries (mean and 95% credible interval) of the dierence between observa-
tions and the within-sample predicted observation process for zones 2, 4 and 8. The left-hand-side
plots show the dierences from the single zone analysis and the right-hand-side from the joint
analysis. It is clear that the mean dierence at each time-zone combination is small and that a
12mean dierence of zero is plausible (the 95% credible intervals include zero). Comparing left to
right, shows the improvement in the within-sample predictions from a single zone analysis to a joint
model; that is, the spatial information included through the GP has increased prediction precision.
We additionally calculated the root mean square error (RMSE) at each time-point (observation
vs prediction) and averaged this measure over all time points for each zone; the results are shown
in Table 2. We see that the mean RMSEs are approximately 5 times larger for the single zone
analysis, giving further evidence of an improvement in t when considering a joint model over all
zones.
Figure 10 shows 10-step ahead predictions for zones 2, 4, 6 and 8, following application of the
method in Section 4.3. Note that the last 10 observations were removed from each zone before
running the inference scheme. The gure shows that the forecast distributions are consistent with
the data as they lie within the forecast intervals for all zones. As we would expect, uncertainty
grows as we move away from the last recorded observation.

6 Discussion and limitations
We have developed a spatio-temporal model for collision rates that allows for serial dependence,
seasonality and correlation between rates at nearby zones. We considered a dynamic linear model
(DLM) whose observation equation takes the form of a single harmonic with a smoothly time-
varying amplitude and phase, thus accounting for seasonality and potential long term changes.
Spatial consistency is accounted for at nearby zones by adding a Gaussian process (GP) component
in the system equation. The model can be tted in Bayesian paradigm using an ecient two-
stage Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure, targeting the joint posterior over the parameters, the
latent time-varying harmonic coecients (amplitude and phase) and dynamic mean. At the rst
stage, parameter samples are generated from the marginal parameter posterior using a random walk
Metropolis algorithm with the likelihood evaluated via a forward lter. At the second stage, samples
of the dynamic parameters are generated conditionally on the static parameter draws from stage
one using a backward sampler. Further details of this forward lter, backward sampling (FFBS)
approach can be found in Petris et al. (2009) (see also Carter and Kohn, 1994, Fr uhwirth-Schnatter,
1994).
We applied our approach to a real data set consisting of 115 months of collision rates over
16eight trac administration zones in Florida, USA. An exploratory analysis that considered sepa-
rate models for each zone found that the phase and amplitude were plausibly constant. We were
therefore able to simplify the joint model over all zones by treating the harmonic components as
static, with a GP prior allowing correlation between these parameters at nearby zones. The valid-
ity of both the single zone and joint models was assessed using within-sample posterior predictive
distributions, which suggested a satisfactory t in both cases. Moreover, the within-sample pre-
dictions were improved substantially when using the joint model, with the credible intervals of our
predictions narrowing almost tenfold, and a reduction in root mean squared error (RMSE) between
the observations and predictions of around a factor of 5.
Our analysis suggests clear spatial patterns between phase and longitude and amplitude and
longitude. For all zones we found that the lowest rates of collisions would fall earlier in the year.
The model also suggests that for western zones, the lowest rates would be in March, and in February
for eastern zones. It appears that peak collision rates are in September in the East and August in
the West. We would also expect to see a larger uctuation in the rate of collisions in an eastern
zone. Our interest also lies in the ability to forecast collision rates in future months. Model-based
out-of-sample forecast distributions suggest that our model is able to capture observed trend and
seasonality in monthly collision rates up to around a year ahead.
Our modelling approach can be improved in a number of ways. For example, it is common to
have covariate information such as trac ow or average speed associated with a particular location
at which a collision has occurred. However, pooling such data over zones is time-consuming and
not always straightforward. Nevertheless, incorporation of covariates into the DLM framework is
straightforward in principle, via the observation equation, and we anticipate improved prediction
in this scenario. Although not pursued here, our model can also be used to predict collision rates
at zones for which observations are not available. Interpolation of the tted GP component in the
system equation governing the dynamic mean and GP prior over the static parameters governing
the harmonic, can be performed for unobserved zones of interest; see e.g. Rasmussen and Williams
(2005) for further details.
