Abstract
This work analyzes data on all public US rms in the 50 year period 1970-2019, and
presents 18 stylized facts of their scale, income, growth, return, investment, and dy-
namism. Special attention is given to (i) identifying distributional forms; and (ii) scale
eects | systematic dierence between rms based on their scale of operations. No-
table ndings are that the Dierence-of-Log-Normals (DLN) distribution has a central
role in describing rm data, scale-dependant heteroskedasticity is rampant, and small
rms are systematically dierent from large rms.

Firm growth is one of the most researched subjects in all of economics. Macroeconomic
growth is micro-founded on rm growth | rms being the productive side of the economy.
Asset pricing deals with the growth of one rm size measure in particular | market value
of equity, adjusted for capital dispersions to equity owners | whose growth is simply equity
return. The rm size/scale distribution (whose rst dierence is rm growth) has seen such
intense research interest that it has its own JEL classication: L11.
Nevertheless, the stylized facts related to rm size, scale (dened as the natural log of
size) and growth are dispersed over a large body of literature spanning several decades.
Much of the \traditional" knowledge has been overturned by latter ndings, such as prior
observations on the shape of the rm scale distribution (rejecting the Pareto and Zipf), or
the shape of the return distribution (rejecting the Stable and Laplace). I am not aware of
any eort to systematically consider stylized facts which hold true regardless of the specic
measure of size being used. Similarly, I am not aware of eorts to systematically consider
scale eects | dierences in rm behavior dependant on the scale of operations.
This paper aims to ll this gap, and provide a systematic and fresh view of the empirical
data on rms. To that end, it analyzes data on all public US rms in the 50-year period
1970-2019, and presents evidence on the distributions and scaling patterns of rm scale,
income, growth, return, investment, and dynamism. In that, it follows a long tradition of
\stylized facts" papers spurring research interest by highlighting salient facts of the data
which have been neglected or gone unnoticed by researchers.1
In a short companion paper, Parham (2022a) presents the dierence-of-log-Normals
(DLN) distribution and posits that it is a fundamental distribution in nature. The DLN
arises when considering phenomena in which two opposing multiplicative forces are at play,
as a direct result of the Central Limit Theorems. A clear example of such a phenomenon
1E.g. Kaldor (1961), Little (1962), Fama (1965), Lucas (1978), Chan, Karceski, and Lakonishok (2003),
Buldyrev, Growiec, Pammolli, Riccaboni, and Stanley (2007), Angelini and Generale (2008), and Kondo,
Lewis, and Stella (2018).
2is rm income, dened to be sales minus expenses, both distributing approximately log-
Normally. Parham (2022a) posits that rm income should distribute DLN, as should all rm
growth distributions. A core nding of this paper is to corroborate this theoretical hypoth-
esis, nding that many rm outcomes distribute DLN. Among them: income (or cashows);
capital dispersions to/from all stakeholders and to/from equity holders; growth in: sales,
expenses, physical and total capital, equity and total value (with both adjusted to capital
dispersions).
The paper further shows that returns and excess returns at the daily, monthly, and yearly
frequency all distribute DLN as well, while rejecting the previous candidates in the literature,
the Stable and Laplace distributions. Firm investment and investment intensity, measured
in several alternative ways, are also shown to distribute DLN. The t between the DLN and
equity returns is especially noteworthy, given the voluminous literature on the determinants,
fat-tails, and statistical properties of equity returns.
A second notable pattern explored in this paper is scaling eects | systematic dier-
ences between rms based on their scale. Both level and dispersion (i.e. heteroskedasticity)
eects are considered, and are shown to be rampant across a wide variety of rm outcomes.
Systematic decreasing dispersion is especially notable in the data, yet gained little attention
from corporate nance scholars. Furthermore, the paper documents a striking dierence
between small rms (below the median size in the data) and large rms (above the median
size in the data). The two groups of rms exhibit strikingly dierent behavior.
Section 2 begins by presenting the data being analyzes. The section describes data
sources, variable denitions, data screens, and deators. It then analyzes the rm scale
distribution by considering several measures of rm scale and adjusting for time eects. I
show that skew-Normality of the rm scale distribution cannot be rejected, and that scales are
highly persistent and cointegrated. Next, the section analyzes the rm income distributions,
which are shown to distribute DLN, and to be subject to signicant time and scale eects.
Next, Section 3 analyzes the various facets of rm growth distributions. It begins by
3presenting the heteroskedasticity of growth w.r.t. scale | growth dispersion is decreasing
with scale | and discusses the relation between this nding and the internal structure of the
rm. Adjusting for time and scale eects, the section shows that growth distributes DLN as
well. Equity returns are a special case of rm growth (i.e., growth in equity value, adjusted
for dividends and net repurchase). As data on rm returns are available at high frequency,
I present similar tests for rm return distributions. DLN is not rejected for raw or excess
returns, at the daily, monthly and yearly frequencies.
Section 3 then goes on to analyze the growth of income. Firm income is sometimes
negative (e.g., losses or cash infusions from stake holders for the purpose of investment) and
hence traditional measures of growth such as dierences in log income between consecutive
periods are undened. The DLN methods paper Parham (2022b) develops a generalized
measure of growth for sometimes-negative DLN RVs, and I use the measure to show that
income growth distributes DLN as well.
Section 4 rst discusses rm investments. It analyzes several measures of investment |
total, physical, and R&D investment, under various denitions. I show that investments,
too, are subject to scale eects and are distributed DLN. The section documents peculiar
anomalies in the behavior of R&D distributions, related to the level and skewness of R&D
w.r.t. scale. To further explore this anomaly, the section then documents several facts related
to rm ratios, which propose small rms and large rms are systematically dierent from
each other is important ways. The section concludes with a discussion of rm dynamism
(entry and exit). I show that scale is highly persistent in the long-term, analyze entry
and exit patterns by scale and age, and document the relation between scale and age more
broadly.

2.1 Data
The data analyzed in this paper cover all public US rms in the 50-year period 1970-
2019. Data are predominantly derived from the yearly CRSP/Compustat data set. For some
tests related to equity returns I use higher-frequency CRSP data, and for some tests related
to rm dynamism I use Compustat data ranging back to 1950. Other minor data sources
include the nominal and real GDP series from FRED and factor returns from Ken French's
website.
Data variables are identied throughout by two capital letter mnemonics (e.g., SL for
rm sales). Table 1 denes all data variables and provides a mapping to Compustat items
used to construct them. I rely on the sources and uses identity,
sales|{z}
SL expenses|{z}
XS= income|{z}
CF= total net dividends|{z}
DI+ total net investment|{z}
IT(1)
to calculate expenses as dissipated sales (i.e., sales - income). This guarantees all expenses,
including cost of goods, selling, general, administrative, taxes, and various \special" and
\one-time" expenses are accounted for.
I dene three subsets of the data: (i) fAllg- 283K raw rm-year observations on 25K
rms, representing the entire Compustat universe; (ii) fGoodg- 200K ltered observations
on 20K rms, with the data lters described momentarily; and (iii) fNon-Bankg- the 164K
subset offGoodgobservations on 16K rms, excluding nancial and utility rms. The
fAllgsubset is used to verify data lters do not introduce substantial bias, and the fNon-
Bankgsubset is used when conducting some analyses related to rm assets, as both excluded
industries dene assets dierently than the rest of the sample. When the subset used is not
mentioned, it is implied to be the fGoodgsubset. The lters applied to reach that subset
remove 62K observations for missing critical data items, 16K for being too small (with a

6cuto of 1M 2019 dollars on value, capital, sales), and 5K for major restructuring (an M&A
larger than 20% of assets). Panel (a) of Figure 1 presents the number of rms per year in
the sample, with a rising trend from less than 2000 rms in 1970 to a signicant peak of
6000 around the late 90's, followed by a continued decline to about 3500 in 2019.
I consider two approaches to adjusting historical dollar values to 2019 dollars: (i) using
the (real) GDP-deator to adjust to real 2019 dollars; and (ii) using nominal GDP as the
deator. The rst approach only adjusts for ination, while the second adjusts for both
ination and the economy-wide \Romerian" secular growth trend, thus yielding a stationary
scale distribution. To see that, Panels (b) and (c) of Figure 1 both show the time-trend of
rm scale distributions over the sample period. Panel (b) uses the real GDP-deator, while
Panel (c) uses the nominal GDP. Panel (c) shows the median rm scale is today at a similar
level as in the 70's, after a downward shift during the 80's and 90's, commensurate with the
increase in number of rms. It also shows that scale dispersion is fairly stable starting the
mid 80's. I will be using nominal GDP as the deator throughout, which eectively holds
the total size of the economy xed.
2.2 Scale
I begin the empirical analysis by considering the rm scale distribution (FSD) in the
CRSP/Compustat data. There is a large literature in economics on the distribution of rm
size and scale, surveyed by Sutton (1997). Sutton concludes that the FSD is found to be
stable over time and approximately Normal. Latter contributions, including Cooley and
Quadrini (2001), Cabral and Mata (2003), Desai, Gompers, and Lerner (2003) and Angelini
and Generale (2008) concentrate on the observed skewness of the FSD, and relate it to
nancial frictions hampering the growth of younger/smaller rms.
Which economic measure best captures rm size (and its log, rm scale)? The asset
pricing literature tends to use market value of equity (EQ) as the preferred measure of size,
the rm growth literature tends to use sales (SL), and the corporate nance literature tends

Fig. 1. Scale - Stylized facts. This gure presents stylized facts of the rm scale distribution
(FSD). Panel (a) presents the number of rms per year. Panels (b) and (c) show the time
trend of the FSD using real and GDP-adjusted dollars, respectively. For each year, the panels
graph thef25;50;75gthpercentiles of the FSD. Panels (d)-(f) present: un-adjusted equity
scale FSD(EQ) w/ tted Normal; time-adjusted equity scale FSD( fEQ) w/ tted Normal;
and FSD(fEQ) w/ tted skew-Normal, respectively. Panels (g)-(i) present the respective q-q
plots of panels (d)-(f).
8to use physical or total capital stock (KP or KT). To these, I add total rm value (VL) and
rm expenses (XS). While using expenses to measure rm size is not common, it is in-line
with the common approach of using number of employees as a measure of rm size. Using
expenses has the benets of being widely available for all rms and being more holistic, i.e.
neutralizing the \build vs. buy" decision of rms.
Panel (a) of Table 2 reports the rst four central moments of each scale measure. Most
FSDs, with the exception of the physical capital FSD, denoted FSD(KP), have a mean
around 6.5 (665M 2019 $) and a standard deviation around 2.1. The FSDs have moderate
positive skewness around 0.3 and kurtosis very close to 3, i.e., no heavy tails. Results are
nearly identical for the fNon-Bankgsubset, though mean scales are slightly lower, indicating
nancial and utility rms are larger than the median rm. For the fAllgsubset, mean scales
are even lower, indicating ltered rms are signicantly smaller than the median rm.
Panel (a) also reports the central moments for time-adjusted versions of each FSD. The
process of time-adjustment standardizes each yearly distribution before pooling them to-
gether. The standardization sets the location and dispersion of each yearly distribution
equal to the sample-wide location and dispersion. This is done to verify we introduce no
time-aggregation artifacts into the pooled distribution, and is akin to taking time xed-eect
from the entire FSD. For further details on the distributional xed-eects transformations
I use throughout, see Appendix A. The time-adjustment has little impact on the moments,
alleviating concerns about aggregation bias.
Visual evidence on the skew-Normality of the FSD is presented in Panels (d)-(i) of Fig-
ure 1. Panel (d) presents the unadjusted FSD(EQ) overlaid with an MLE-tted Normal
distribution, and Panel (e) presents the time-adjusted version, FSD( fEQ). In both cases, the
t is visually close but not exact, as further highlighted by the quantile-quantile (q-q) plots
vs. the Normal in Panels (g) and (h). Panels (f) and (i) then present the FSD( fEQ) vs. the
skew-Normal, with a visually good t in both the histogram and q-q views. Similar results
hold for the other FSD avors.

Panel (a) of this table presents the rst four central moments of the FSD, based on six
measures of size. Variable denitions are in Table 1. Time-adjusted versions are marked with
gXX, and time-adjustment procedure is described in Appendix A. The panel also presents
the persistence of each measure, using the Arellano and Bover (1995)/Blundell and Bond
(1998) panel estimator. Panel (b) presents the correlations between the measures, with the
upper triangular presenting correlations between unadjusted measures (XX) and the lower
triangular correlations between time-adjusted measures ( gXX). Panel (c) presents the results
of three cointegration tests between all FSD panels, with the rst two tests from Pedroni
(2004), and the third from Westerlund (2005). The rst two test the null of no cointegration
vs. the alternative that all panels are cointegrated while the third tests vs. the alternative
that some panels are cointegrated. Tests are conducted by decade, on the available balanced
sample of time-adjusted measures within each decade.

10Formal tests for the unadjusted and adjusted versions of all six FSD avors, against
both the Normal and the skew-Normal, are presented in Table 3. The three goodness-of-
t distributional tests I use are the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S), the Chi-square (C-2), and
the Anderson-Darling (A-D) tests. The three tests are sensitive to dierent distributional
deviations | K-S has uniform power throughout, C-2 is more powerful around the center-
mass, and A-D is more powerful around the tails | hence I report results of all three tests.
Panel (a) shows that Normality of the FSD is generally rejected across the board (at the 5%
signicance level). In contrast, Skew-Normality is not rejected for any FSD avor (with the
exception of physical capital) by either test, as seen in Panel (b) of Table 3.
The better t of the skew-Normal distribution might not be too surprising, given that
it has an extra degree of freedom (i.e., an extra parameter). To account for the degrees of
freedom, I use the relative likelihood test, derived from the AIC statistic of Akaike (1973).
The relative likelihood is a non-nested version of the likelihood ratio test, accounting for the
number of parameters.2I also report relative likelihood tests using the BIC statistic, which
penalizes extra degrees of freedom more heavily. Panel (c) presents the relative likelihood
tests of the Normal and the skew-Normal, showing that the skew-Normal yields a signicant
improvement over the Normal as a statistical model for the FSD, even after penalizing for
the extra parameter.
The data suggest skew-Normality has excellent t to the public-rm FSD. Given the
large extant literature regarding the FSD, the most puzzling fact about the FSD in the
CRSP/Compustat data is how unpuzzling it is. I conclude:
Observation 1. The FSD is distributed skew-Normal.
After exploring the cross-sectional dimension of the FSD data, I turn to time-dimension
facts. The last two rows in Panel (a) of Table 2 present the persistence of each scale measure
using the system GMM estimator of Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond

aUsing thefNon-Bankgdata subset
12(1998). The persistence of time-adjusted values is of greater interest as it removes spurious
eects stemming from the business cycle. The persistence of values and capitals is close to
1, with sales somewhat less persistent and expenses the least persistent. I conclude:
Observation 2. Value and capital scales are highly persistent. Sales and particularly ex-
penses somewhat less so.
The relation between the dierent measures is explored in Panels (b) and (c) of Table 2.
The simple pooled correlations between each scale measure are presented in Panel (b), for
both adjusted and unadjusted scales. The two highest correlations are between (i) sales and
expenses; and (ii) rm value and total capital. The lowest correlation is between equity
value and physical capital. Panel (c) then presents panel cointegration tests between the
dierent measures. Because the cointegration tests of Pedroni (2004) and Westerlund (2005)
require balanced panels, Panel (c) presents the tests by decade and includes all balanced
panels available within the decade. The hypothesis of no cointegration is strongly rejected
by all tests for all decades. I conclude:
Observation 3. FSD measures are cointegrated.
2.3 Income
Firm income is a variable of considerable importance in the theory of rm scale. Income
is both the means to scaling (as it provides money for investments) and the ends of scaling
(as it provides money for dividends). This section mainly considers the rm net income
distribution, denoted FID(CF) and the income of rm owners | equity and debt holders
| total dividends, whose distribution is denoted FID(DI). It also presents results for the
alternative top-down denition of income FID(CA), commonly used in the literature, and
for dispensations to equity holders alone, denoted FID(DE).
Panels (a) and (d) of Figure 2 present truncated views of FID(CF) and FID(DI), respec-
tively. The panels help explain why income measures are not typically used as measures
13of scale: income exhibits exponential tails in both the positive and negative directions . The
common way of dealing with exponential tails | applying a log transform | hence cannot
be used. About 20% of CF observations and 40% of DI observations are negative, corre-
sponding to losses and capital infusions from owners, respectively, and so ignoring negative
values is untenable.
To deal with the double-exponential nature of the tails, Panels (b) and (e) then present
the same data, untruncated but with the x-axis transformed to Inverse Hyperbolic Sine
(asinh) scale. The asinh scale can simply be thought of as a log scale, but in both the
positive and negative directions, and allows us to view the entire distribution. Panels (a),
(b), (d), (e) are overlaid with MLE-tted dierence-of-log-Normals (DLN) distributions,
exhibiting excellent t. The accompanying q-q plots in Panels (c) and (f) conrm this
observation. The companion paper Parham (2022b) provides econometric details, describes
the DLN distribution, the sinh and asinh transforms, and the rationale and benets of using
them.
Panel (g) considers the dependence of income on scale (using total capital KT as the
measure of scale). I rst split the data into 49 equal bins, based on rm scale, truncating the
top and bottom 1% of the FSD(KT), such that each bin contains 2% of the observations.
For each bin, Panel (g) plots the (10 ;25;50;75;90)thpercentiles of FID(CF). The panel
shows income is naturally increasing with scale | larger rms earn and dispense (or lose
and are infused) more money than smaller rms | so the \middle" of the panel hollows
as rm scale rises. Panel (h) hence presents the time- and scale-adjusted FID, denoted
FID(fCF), overlaid with tted DLN distribution. Adjusting to time-eects is done as before.
To account for the ubiquitous scale-eects, I consider income intensity | income divided by
size (KT). The visual t of the adjusted distribution is again excellent. Panel (i) presents
the income intensity distribution by scale, showing scale-dependant systematic patterns in
income intensity as well. Income intensity increases with size, and the number of rms
reporting losses decreases. Similar results hold for the distributions of CA, DI, and DE, and

15when adjusting by other measures of scale.
Table 4 reports descriptive statistics of the FID. Due to the double-exponential nature
of the tails, the table presents the statistics separately for positive and negative incomes, in
asinh scale. We observe low skewness and kurtosis close to 3 for both halves of the distribu-
tion, again indicating approximate (log-)Normality on each side. The 1-lag persistence on
the positive side is relatively high, ranging from 0 :3 to 0:8, while on the negative side persis-
tence is low or negative. This implies rms with negative income revert to positivity quickly.
The table reports the slopes of increasing median on the positive and negative sides (e.g., the
slopes in panel (g) of Figure 2 for CF). The positive slopes are very close to 1, justifying the
use of intensities. Table 4 also reports the moments for the income intensity distributions
| all are skewed and all are signicantly heavy-tailed, with relatively low persistence, and
no increasing intensity w.r.t scale.
Table 4
Income - Descriptive statistics
The rst four columns of this table present statistics for the positive side of the FID, while
the next four concentrate on the negative side and the last four on the entire income intensity
distribution (i.e., income divided by total capital KT). Variable denitions are in Table 1.
The positive and negative sides are in asinh scale. M1toM4are the rst four central
moments. Persistence for the positives and negatives is the 1-lag pooled auto-correlation,
while for intensities it is the Arellano and Bover (1995)/Blundell and Bond (1998) panel
estimate. %Ob is the percent of total observations in the positive/negative side, and may
not sum to 100% due to zero-valued obs. The scaling coecient is the slope in a quantile
regression of (asinh) income or of intensity on scale.

The excellent t of the DLN, suggested in Figure 2, is conrmed by Table 5, which
presents the formal distributional tests. Given the double-exponential nature of income, I
16concentrate on tests vs. the Stable, Laplace, and DLN distributions | all yielding double-
exponential (i.e. heavy) tails. The tests strongly reject the Stable and Laplace on all income
and income intensity variables considered, while the DLN is generally not rejected (with the
exception of equity dispensations | DE). The relative likelihood tests strongly favor the
DLN as a statistical model of income, even for the rejected DE. Upon inspection, the DE
data include a large mass of observations around zero distorting the shape of the distribution
and likely driven by xed costs leading to an inaction region in rm policy. I conclude:
Observation 4. The FID is distributed DLN.
3 Growth, return, and income growth
3.1 Firm growth
The statistical distribution of rm growth rates (henceforth FGD) in the data has been
of considerable interest to scholars. Ashton (1926) is the rst to document that the growth
of British textile businesses in the period 1884  1924, measured by the number of spin-
dles employed, was heavy-tailed. Nevertheless, the work of Gibrat (1931), assuming growth
is Gaussian, remained the workhorse of rm growth modelling. \Gibrat's law" and the
dominance of the assumption that growth is Normally distributed stem from a simple, the-
oretically appealing application of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). If yearly growth is
the result of many smaller i.i.d shocks with nite variance, then yearly growth converges to
a Normal distribution. There is now a large literature empirically rejecting Gibrat's pre-
dictions. See review by Sutton (1997). I defer further discussion of the literature on rm
growth and its various ndings to the companion paper Parham (2022c), and concentrate
henceforth on the data.
Two common ways of measuring growth are using (i) percents and (ii) log-point growth
rates. Parham (2022b) (Section 3.2) discusses measures of growth and shows the appropriate

Income - Distributional tests
This table presents results of tests of distribution equality for the four measures of income:
CF, CA, DI, and DE, described in Table 1, as well as their time- and scale-adjusted versions.
Scale adjustments use total capital (KT) as the size measure. K-S is a Kolmogorov{Smirnov
test; C-2 is a binned 2test with 50 bins; A-D is an Anderson-Darling test. Panels (a)-(c)
report the test statistics and their p-values for the Stable, Laplace, and DLN, respectively.
Panel (d) reports the relative likelihoods for each distribution. The raw variables (columns
1-4) use thefGoodgdata subset. The scale adjusted versions use the fNon-Bankgsubset.

18measure for rm growth is log-point growth, as percentage growth introduces a convexity
bias. LetMtdenote one of the measures of rm size discussed above in Section 2.2. Firm
growth is then dened as the dierence in log size between subsequent periods
dlog(Mt) = log(Mt) log(Mt 1) (2)
The rst six columns in Panel (a) of Table 6 present the descriptive statistics of the
various rm growth distributions (FGD). Mean growth is close to zero, as expected from
a stationary distribution of size. Almost all measures exhibit negative skewness, and all
measures have kurtosis signicantly higher than 3, indicating heavy tails. Note that equity
and total value growth (EQ and VL) adjust for capital dispensations (and infusions), making
them proper measures of investment return, at the yearly horizon.
Figure 3 presents graphical evidence on the FGD. Panel (a) presents a histogram of the
growth in sales, denoted FGD(SL), along with two tted Normal curves. The rst curve is
the standard MLE-tted Normal (i.e., tted by minimizing a squared-error metric), while
the second is instead tted by minimizing least absolute deviations (LAD). When heavy
tails are involved, the two minimization objectives yield signicantly dierent results, as
squared-errors give more weight to tting the tails, while LAD give more weight to tting
the center-mass (at the expense of the tails). The deviation from Normality is striking, as
can be seen in the MLE-tted Normal's q-q plot in Panel (b) and the LAD-tted Normal's
q-q in Panel (c). The LAD-tted Normal shows better t around the center, but exhibits
even stronger deviation around the tails. Panel (d) presents the q-q vs. the DLN, showing
an excellent t. Similar results hold when using the other size measures.
Patterns related to the business-cycle are evident in Panel (e), which presents the time-
trends of the FGD(SL) (see e.g. the years 1975, 2001, 2008). A cleaner look at the FGD hence
requires adjustments (by taking year xed eects), similar to those previously employed for
rm scale. Panel (f) uses binscatter plots to presents two other systematic patterns in the

distribution (FGD). Panel (a) presents the FGD(SL), with MLE- and LAD-tted Normal
distributions, and panels (b) and (c) present the respective q-q plots. Panel (d) presents
the q-q plot of FGD(SL) vs. the DLN. Panel (e) presents the FGD time trend by plotting
thef25;50;75gthpercentiles of the FGD per year. Panel (f) plots binscatters of the median
and IQR of FGD(SL) per 49 scale bins, ignoring the top and bottom 1% of the data. Panel

presents the time- and scale-adjusted FGD( fSL), overlaid with an MLE-tted DLN, and Panel
(i) presents the respective q-q plot.
21FGD.3The FGD presents moderately decreasing growth level with scale, and substantial
decreasing growth dispersion with scale (i.e., conditional heteroscedasticity of growth rates).
These two patterns are not new, and were rst documented by Manseld (1962) with later
empirical support by Hall (1987) and Stanley, Amaral, Buldyrev, Havlin, Leschhorn, Maass,
Salinger, and Stanley (1996). In Panel (f), I again split the data into 49 equal bins and
calculate the bin's median growth rate: Median[dlog( SL)] and the bin's dispersion of growth:
IQR[dlog(SL)]. The panel then plots these values w.r.t. rm scale. Panel (g) provides a
second view of this phenomenon, by plotting the (10 ;25;50;75;90)thpercentiles of FSD(SL)
for each bin.
The scale-dependant patterns in panels (f) and (g) raise concerns that observed FGD
heavy tails might be an aggregation artifact. In the words of Fama (1965),
\Perhaps the most popular approach to explaining long-tailed distributions has
been to hypothesize that the distribution [...] is actually a mixture of several
normal distributions with possibly the same mean, but substantially dierent
variances."
I hence turn to analyzing the decreasing dispersion of growth rates more closely.
The six panels of Figure 4 present direct evidence of this conditional heteroskedasticity,
for each of the six rm size measures previously used M=fEQ;VL;KP;KT;SL;XS g. The
gure plots log(IQR[dlog( M)]) per bin as a function of log( M), along with tted regression
lines. For all six measures, the R2of the regressions are high ( >0:93), the coecients are
similar in magnitude (  0:130:02), and are highly signicant (t-stat 40). Results are
similar with 98 bins and when using standard deviation rather than IQR.
These results, and especially the high R2values, are strong indication of a mechanical
relation between scale and growth dispersion. They are also intuitively clear upon inspection.
The likelihood that a rm with $100M in sales will increase sales to $200M in a single year
is intuitively higher than the likelihood a rm with $100B in sales will double its sales in a

23single year. The predominant explanation of this mechanical relation, e.g. Sutton (2002), is
simple and derived from the logic of modern portfolio theory.
To see that, assume that a rm is a bundle of projects. If project growth rates are not
fully correlated within the rm, then a \portfolio" of such projects (i.e., the rm) will have
growth dispersion that is decreasing with the number of projects in the portfolio, similar to
the diversication eect in a portfolio of stocks. A straightforward application of portfolio
theory implies a linear relation between log( SD[dlog(M)]) and log( M), and further implies
that if projects are of the same size and have uncorrelated growth rates, then the slopes
in Figure 4 should be  0:5. As discussed by Sutton (2002), that the slopes in Figure 4
are higher than 0:5 is not surprising. A positive correlation between the growth rates of
projects, which is likely for projects of the same rm, or an equally likely deviation from
the assumption that all projects are of the same size, will lead to less \diversication" and
higher slope. I conclude:
Observation 5. FGD dispersion is systematically decreasing with scale.
To oset this mechanical relation, I use the systematic nature of the decreasing dispersion
apparent in Figure 4 to adjust the location and dispersion of rm growth rates as a function
of their scale. I.e., I take both time and scale xed-eects from the entire FGD distribution
(see Appendix A for details). This is similar to the strategy used by Barro (1991) to adjust
the heteroskedasticity of GDP growth based on country size.
The last six columns in Panel (a) of Table 6 present the descriptive statistics of the
adjusted versions of the FGDs. Skewness increases signicantly in the adjusted versions,
and kurtosis remains high and in most cases even increases. This implies the heavy-tails are
not a scale-aggregation artifact. Panel (h) of Figure 3 presents the time- and scale-adjusted
sales growth distribution, denoted FGD( fSL), overlaid with a tted DLN distribution. The
t is again remarkable, as can also be seen in Panel (i), presenting the q-q plot of FGD( fSL)
vs. the DLN.
The excellent t of the DLN is conrmed by formal distributional tests reported in
24Table 7. I again concentrate on the Stable, Laplace, and DLN distributions. The Stable
distribution has been the workhorse candidate for modelling rm growth since the early
works of Mandelbrot (1961) and Fama (1963), while the Laplace has later been proposed as
a better alternative by Stanley et al. (1996) and the following literature. The tests generally
reject the Stable and Laplace on all growth measures (at the 5% condence level). The DLN
is not rejected for any raw or adjusted growth measure, with the exception of growth in
physical capital. The relative likelihood tests are unequivocal - the DLN is strongly favored
as a statistical model of growth, even for the rejected KP. I conclude:
Observation 6. The FGD is distributed DLN.
While a full economic discussion of whythe FGD distributes DLN is left to the companion
paper Parham (2022c), a simple intuitive explanation can be gleaned by thinking of ow vs.
stock of value. If the ow of economic value (e.g., rm income) is distributed DLN per
Observation 4, and the stock of economic value (e.g., rm capital) is a running sum of ows,
then the growth in the stock will tend to have the same distribution as the ow.
Turning to time-series aspects of rm growth, the last two rows in Panel (a) of Table 6
present the persistence of the raw and adjusted growth measures. Total and equity value
growth (i.e., total and equity returns) exhibit mild reversal at the yearly frequency, while
capital and sales growth exhibit moderate momentum, with persistence in the range 0 :11 to
0:16. Expenses, both raw and adjusted, exhibit moderate reversal, with persistence of  0:17
and 0:13 for raw and adjusted expense growth, respectively.
The dierent growth measures are considerably less correlated than the scale measures,
as can be seen in Panel (b) of Table 6. Equity and total value growth are strongly correlated,
which is not surprising. Sales growth is moderately correlated with both capital and expense
growth. The most surprising nding in Panel (b) is that expense growth is notnegatively
correlated with equity or total value growth, but rather is eectively uncorrelated with them.

263.2 A closer look at equity returns
One measure of rm growth stands tall above all others in nancial economics | equity
returns, or FGD(EQ). Note that the buy and hold equity return at the yearly frequency, in
log-points, is
dlog(EQt) = log(EQt+DEt) log(EQt 1) (3)
or simply equity growth adjusted for capital dispensations to/from equity holders. A second
reason to focus on equity growth, besides its disproportionate importance, is the availability
of higher-frequency data. While growth in sales can be computed yearly or sometimes
quarterly, growth in equity value for publicly traded rms can be calculated at nearly any
desired frequency. Does the observation that equity returns distribute DLN hold at higher
frequencies, based on a dierent data source, and for excess returns as well?
This closer look begins with daily stock returns for the entire CRSP universe from 1/1970
to 12/2019, totalling 83M raw observations and 63M non-missing observations for 30K rms.
I use those to calculate dividend and split adjusted daily, monthly and yearly returns, in
log-point terms. I also calculate excess returns relative to the Fama-French 3-factor (FF3)
model, using factor returns from Ken French's data library and betas based on 12-month
rolling windows of daily returns.
One challenge with analyzing the distribution of high frequency return data is that the
eect of discrete prices on returns can no longer be neglected. Prior to 4/2001, stock prices
were generally quoted as fractions in base 16 (e.g., 3 and 7/16 dollars per share). Even
post the 2001 \decimalization," prices are quoted to two decimal places (e.g., $3.44 per
share). This means returns are not continuous | a share beginning trading at 3+7/16 can
remain at 3+7/16 (have 0% return), go up at least to 3+8/16 (have 1.82% return) or go
down at least to 3+6/16 (have -1.82% return). Return values in the range (  1:82;1:82)nf0g
are unobtainable. This causes the high-frequency return distributions to be \saw-toothed"
and eliminates any ability to cogently analyze their distributional form. To overcome this
27issue, I add a tiny amount of uniform noise to stock prices prior to calculating returns. In
essence, I assume a quoted price of 3+7/16 means the actual price is uniformly distributed
between 3+7 =161=32. Similarly, a quoted price of 3.44 means the actual price is uniformly
distributed between 3 :440:005. This procedure unrolls the eect of discrete prices and
prevents \bunching" at the high-frequency return distributions.
Table 8 presents the descriptive statistics of the various equity return avors. The twelve
avors arefyearly,monthly,daily gXfraw,excessgXfunadjusted,adjusted gwith the adjusted
avors adjusting for time and scale xed eects as before. All returns are considerably
negatively skewed and exhibit heavy tails, as can be seen by the third and fourth moments.
Hence, table 8 reports the median and IQR in additions to the rst four central moments of
each distribution. Both mean and median of the excess return distributions are negative, at
all horizons, which is surprising as intuition would imply excess returns should be zero on
average.

29This surprising fact is both explained and escalated by the graphical evidence in Figure 5.
Panel (a) presents median and IQR binscatters for yearly raw returns, with Panel (b) pre-
senting them for monthly excess returns and Panel (c) for daily excess returns. In all cases,
we observe an increase in median return with scale (measured by log lagged equity value).
This increase is striking as it seemingly goes against the well-known \size eect" in the asset
pricing literature, and holds for raw and excess return at each of the frequencies considered.
Note however that the bins in Panels (a)-(c) of Figure 5 are not tradable portfolios, so these
results should be considered with care. Return dispersion is decreasing with scale, as with
all other growth measures. While surprising, the data suggest the following observation:
Observation 7. The FGD(EQ) location and dispersion are increasing and decreasing with
scale, respectively.
Next, Panels (d)-(f) present the distribution histograms for the respective avors consid-
ered above. All histograms are overlaid with tted DLN distributions, with remarkable t.
Panels (g)-(i) present the respective q-q plots vs. the DLN, again exhibiting excellent t.
The t is likewise conrmed by the formal distributional tests reported in Table 9, which
handily reject the Stable and Laplace in favor of the DLN. I conclude:
Observation 8. The FGD(EQ) is distributed DLN.
3.3 Income growth
The last growth distribution I analyze is the rm income growth distribution (FIGD).
Measuring income growth is complicated by the fact income is distributed DLN as per
Observation 4. Incomes are sometimes negative, and the question \what is the growth in
income for a rm that lost $100M last year and earned $80M this year" is not generally
well-formed. Parham (2022b) tackles the measurement of growth in DLN variables, showing

With a coherent growth measure in hand, we can turn to Table 10 which presents the
descriptive statistics of income growth for the four income measures of Section 2.3, as well
as their adjusted avors. Panel (a) presents the moments for all valid observations, while
Panels (b) and (c) separately consider income growth when the initial income is positive and
negative, respectively. All FIGD avors exhibit heavy tails (high kurtosis) and some have
high skewness, so the panels report the medians as well as means. The dierence in median
between the three panels is instructive.
In Panel (a), median income growth rates are low and positive, as expected, with
the exception of growth in total dispensations FIGD(DI). When concentrating on positive
beginning-of-period values in Panel (b), median FIGD(DI) is strongly negative, indicating a
reversal in total dispensations to rm owners. Other income measures have median growth
values relatively close to zero in that case as well. Panel (c) presents a starkly dierent situa-
tion: when beginning of period income is negative, we observe strong positive median growth
in income during the period | rms with negative income revert quickly and strongly.
Figure 6 provides further evidence on income growth. Panel (a) presents the time-trends
of the FIGD(CF), exhibiting similar business-cycle movements as before. Panel (b) presents
the FIGD(CF) overlaid with a tted DLN distribution, exhibiting good t, which is corrob-
orated by panel (c) presenting the q-q plot of the t. Panel (d) presents the dependence of
the FIGD(CF) on scale (measured as log rm value), showing stable median growth close
to zero and decreasing dispersion with scale. The decreasing dispersion of cash-ow growth
ts the patterns observed in Figure 4, including a similar decreasing dispersion coecient,
as seen in panel (e).
The same is however not true for rm total capital dispensations. Panel (f) presents the

Panel (a) of this table presents the rst four central moments and the median of the rm
income growth distribution (FIGD), based on the four measures of income from Table 5 and
the DLN growth measure of Parham (2022b). Time- and scale-adjusted versions (relative
to total capital KT) are marked with gXX, and the adjustment procedure is described in
Appendix A. Panels (b) and (c) condition on the sign of beginning-of-period values, such

overlaid with an MLE-tted DLN, and panel (c) presents the respective q-q plot. Panel (d)

histogram, but split the sample to growth from positive values and growth from negative
values, respectively.
35dependence of FIGD(DI) on scale, exhibiting increasing median and constant dispersion.
Small rms have negative median capital dispensation growth, meaning they are prone to
\death spirals". Panel (g) presents the FIGD(DI) overlaid with tted DLN and exhibiting a
fairly poor t. The t somewhat improves if we separately consider the growth from negative
vs. from positive values, presented in panels (h) and (i), respectively. The dierence in the
location of both distributions, presented in panels (b) and (c) of Table 10, can be observed
in the last two panels of Figure 4.
Distributional tests for the FIGD are reported in Table 11. The Stable and Laplace dis-
tributions are again generally rejected. DLN is not rejected for FIGD(CF) and FIGD(CA),
but unlike in previous tests, it is rejected for FIGD(DI) and FIGD(DE). The relative likeli-
hood tests nevertheless continues to strongly favor the DLN over the Stable and Laplace for
all avors of the FIGD, as before. I conclude:
Observation 9. The FIGD(CF) has decreasing dispersion with scale and is distributed DLN.
4 Investment, ratios, and dynamism
4.1 Physical investment and depreciation
Firm scale and growth patterns are inexorably related to rm investment | the means of
growth and capital accumulation. I next review the data on the rm investment distribution
(FND), composed of four panels: total investment, measured as changes in total capital net
of depreciation (IT); physical investment, measured as changes in physical capital net of de-
preciation (IP); physical investment, measured in the traditional way as capital expenditures
minus capital sales (IA); and depreciation as reported by rms (DP). Depreciation, while
not an instance of investment, is nevertheless closely related to it and is hence included in
the analysis.
Table 12 reports descriptive statistics of the FND. For the three investment types, which

37are sometimes negative, the table presents the statistics separately for positive and negative
investment, in asinh scale. Low skewness and kurtosis close to 3 on both sides indicates
approximate (log-)Normality on each side, an observation which also extends to the (always
positive) depreciation panel. Similar to rm income, the 1-lag persistence on the positive
side is relatively high, while on the negative side persistence is low or negative. Firms with
positive investment persist while rms with negative investment revert. Depreciation is
highly persistent, as expected from an accounting variable largely out of the rm's control.
More than a third of total investment observations are negative - implying an analysis of
investment patterns which ignores negative investments is fairly incomplete. Investment
intensities are skewed and heavy-tailed, but exhibit no signicant scaling behavior. The same
is not true for depreciation intensity (relative to physical capital KP), which is decreasing
with scale.
Table 12
Investment - Descriptive statistics
The rst four columns of this table present statistics for the positive side of the FND (incl.
depreciation DP), while the next three concentrate on the negative side and the last four
on the entire investment intensity distribution (i.e., investment divided by total capital KT,
and DP/KP). Variable denitions are in Table 1. The positive and negative sides are in
asinh scale. M1toM4are the rst four central moments. Persistence for the positives
and negatives is the 1-lag pooled auto-correlation, while for intensities it is the Arellano
and Bover (1995)/Blundell and Bond (1998) panel estimate. %Ob is the percent of total
observations in the positive/negative side, and may not sum to 100% due to zero-valued obs.
The scaling coecient is the slope in a quantile regression of (asinh) income or of intensity
on scale. All values are based on the fNon-Bankgdata subset.

Figure 7 provides graphical evidence on FND patterns. Panels (a)+(d) present the total
38investment distribution FND(IT) overlaid with MLE-tted DLN and its q-q plot. Panel
(b)+(e) and (c)+(f) repeat for physical investment FND(IP) and for total investment inten-
sity FND(fIT), respectively. Investment intensity is measured relative to total capital KT.
The FND exhibits excellent t to the DLN. Panel (g) presents the dependence of FND(IT)
on scale, with investment showing a similar pattern to the \hollow middle" of the income
distribution in panel (g) of Figure 2. Panel (h) then presents the dependence of investment
intensity FND( fIT) on rm scale, exhibiting decreasing dispersion of intensity.
Panel (i) then presents the dependence of physical depreciation intensity, DP/KP, on
physical capital scale. The importance of DP/KP is that it measures the rate of physical
depreciation, often denoted Kin theoretical work. Panel (i) shows that depreciation rates
are decreasing with scale. Small rms have physical depreciation rates as high as 40%, while
large rms have depreciation rates around 10%. The same pattern, though more muted, is
observed when one considers the relation of total depreciation intensity, DP/KT, on total
capital scale. I conclude:
Observation 10. Physical depreciation rates are decreasing with scale.
Once again, the distributional tests conrm that the FND distributes DLN, as can be
seen in Table 13. The dierences are especially stark here, with the Stable and Laplace
distributions strongly rejected. I conclude:
Observation 11. The FND is distributed DLN.
4.2 R&D investment
A special type of investment considered separately is R&D investment. A major reason is
that the stock of R&D, denoted knowledge capital , is unobservable. We hence lack measures
of knowledge depreciation, cannot construct investment series based on changes in capital
adjusted for depreciation (as we did for physical capital), and observe only strictly positive
R&D expenditure values.

41Panels (a)-(c) of Figure 8 present the distributions of (logs of) R&D investment, R&D
investment intensity relative to total capital KT, and R&D investment intensity relative to
rm sales SL, respectively. Panels (a)-(c) are also overlaid with tted skew-Normal distri-
butions, though the t appears poor. Panel (c) exhibits especially striking deviation from
skew-Normality, unlike any we encountered so far.
To explore these patterns, panel (d) plots the distribution of (log) R&D intensity per
scale bin, which exhibits signicant decrease in median intensity with scale. The decrease
is not smooth, but rather we observe a steep decline between scales 6 and 8. This pattern
is clear in panels (e) and (f), which present the per-bin median and skewness of (log) R&D
intensity, relative to total capital KT and to sales SL, respectively. A second fact apparent
in panels (e) and (f) is the strong negative relation between the median and skewness of (log)
R&D intensity, especially for non-tiny rms (sales or capital above $100M, or scale 4.6).
As panels (g)-(i) show, these patterns are fairly unique to the R&D intensity distribution,
and are not evident at (log) physical investment intensity IP/KT. Panels (g) and (h) present
the distribution of log(IP/KT), and its binned median and skewness, for R&D performing
rms. We in fact observe a slight increase in intensity with scale. Panel (h) presents the
binned median and skewness of log(IP/KT) for the non-R&D performing rms in the sample,
again showing fairly constant intensity.
The relation between (log) investment intensity's median and skewness is further reviewed
in Table 14, along with other descriptive statistics. Panel (a) shows both R&D and physical
(log) intensities share similar mean and s.d., but R&D intensity is signicantly more per-
sistent than physical intensity. R&D has a strong decreasing median with scale, as seen in
Figure 8. The dependence of median (log) investment intensity on scale is generally positive
for R&D-performing rms and generally negative for non-R&D-performing rms.
We observe similar relations when considering the skewness-median relation in Panels
(b)-(d). The relation is negative for R&D intensity and for physical intensity at non-R&D-
performing rms, while it is generally positive for physical intensity at R&D-performing

Panel (a) presents the (log) R&D investment distribution overlaid with MLE-tted skew-
Normal. Panels (b) and (c) repeat for (log) R&D intensity relative to KT and SL, respec-
tively. Panels (d) and (e) present the distribution of (log) R&D intensity by KT scale, and
its binned median and skewness. Panel (f) repeats panel (e) , but for (log) R&D intensity
relative to SL scale. Panels (g) and (h) present the distribution of (log) physical investment
intensity IP by KT scale, and its binned median and skewness, but limits the sample to R&D
performing rms. Panel (i) repeats panel (h) for non-R&D performing rms. All gures are
based on thefNon-Bankgdata subset.

R&D - Descriptive statistics
This table presents moments of (log) R&D and physical investment intensities. The rst two
columns describe R&D intensities relative to KT and SL. The next four describe physical
intensities for R&D-performing rms, and the last four repeat for non-R&D-performing rms.
Only positive investments are considered. Panel (a) describes the rst four moments of each
distribution, its persistence of investment based on the Arellano and Bover (1995)/Blundell
and Bond (1998) panel estimator, and its coecient of decreasing median with scale. Panels
(b)-(d) reports results of skewness-median regressions, for all rms, small rms ( <$100M in
KT or SL), and large rms ( >$100M), respectively.

Observation 12. R&D intensity is non-linearly decreasing with scale.
Observation 13. R&D intensity's median is negatively correlated with its skewness.
Observation 14. Physical intensity at (non) R&D-performing rms exhibits patterns (sim-
ilar) opposite those of R&D intensity.
4.3 Ratios
The non-linear decrease in R&D intensity reported at Observation 12 appears to indicate
that small rms are somehow systematically and discontinuously dierent from large rms.
This section considers some important rm ratios and yields a similar conclusion.
Figure 9 reports the dependence of several important rm ratios on rm scale. Panel (a)
presents the medians of debt, equity, and total payout ratios, dened as DD/DB, DE/EQ,
and DI/VL, respectively. The panel shows a stable debt payout ratio of about 4% across
the rm scale distribution, indicating a stable cost of debt for rms of all sizes. The equity
payout ratio exhibits remarkably dierent patterns. The median equity payout ratio of small
rms is 0, while the median equity payout ratio of large rms is increasing with rm scale.
The total payout ratio is fairly uniformly increasing with rm scale, as predicted by, e.g.,
Modigliani and Miller (1958). Panel (b) complements the picture by presenting the median
debt-to-equity ratio of rms across the scale distribution, with larger rms linearly tending
to operate with more debt. The probable cause of these facts is presented in Panel (c), which
reports the median and mean net protability (cashow-to-value ratio) across the rm scale
distribution. Small rms, below the median scale in the data (log( KT) = 6:5) tend to not
produce enough cashows to aord equity payouts, whereas large rms do.
Panels (d)-(f) present further evidence of a systematic dierence between small and large
rms. Panel (d) presents the mean and median of the rm expense (in)eciency ratio XS/SL,
as a function of rm scale. The median shows a smooth eciency gain w/ scale (and an
45R2=0.98), while the mean shows the average small rm loses money by having an eciency
ratio>1. Panel (e) presents a transformed version of the data in panel (d),  log(XS/SL). We
can see how negative eciency skewness for small rms becomes positive eciency skewness
for large rms, with the crossing happening around median rm scale. Panel (f) complements
the picture by presenting the mean and median of a second eciency ratio - the sales to
capital ratio SL/KT. Again, we can see clear dierences between small and large rms -
small rms are frugal on capital, while larger rms are more capital intensive.
These data, along with the R&D data from the previous section, are commensurate with
a view of the rm scale distribution in which rms below the median scale are \laboratories"
and rms above the median scale are \production factories". But as the focus of the current
paper is collecting and analyzing stylized facts, this insight is left for future work. I conclude:
Observation 15. Small and large rms (below and above the median scale) are systemati-
cally dierent from each other.
Observation 16. Median debt-to-equity, rm eciency, and total payout ratio grow linearly
with scale.
4.4 Dynamism
The last rm distribution feature I review is dynamism, or the entry, exit, and long-term
scaling dynamics of rms. Figure 10 presents the relevant facts for the US public-rm data.
Panel (a) begins by presenting the long-term scale of rms conditional on their current scale.
For each scale bin, the panel graphs the f1;10;25;50;75;90;99gthpercentiles of the 10-year
ahead scale distribution of rms in the bin. The medians align along the 45-degree line
almost perfectly, the 10-90 range is approximately one scale up and down, and even the 1-99
range is only about two scales in any direction. Small rms remain small, large rms remain
large, and there is little mixing even at long horizons. I conclude:
Observation 17. Firm scale is highly persistent even in the long-term.

Panel (a) graphs the f1;10;25;50;75;90;99gthpercentiles of the 10-year ahead KT scale
distribution per current scale bin. Panel (b) graphs percentiles of the age distribution by
scale, and panel (c) percentiles of the scale distribution by age, along with a tted median
regression line. Panels (d) and (e) plot exit and entry probability by scale bin, respectively,
and include exponential-t trend lines. Panel (f) plots exit probability by age, along with
a linear trend line. Panel (g) plots the (log) number of observations by age in the entire
sample, along with the tted trend line. Panel (g) presents the distribution of scale at entry
and at exit, and panel (h) plots the probability of entry and exit by year, with the horizontal
line the unconditional exit probability. All gures are based on the fNon-Bankgdata subset.
48Panels (b) and (c) of Figure 10 present the relation between scale and public rm age.
Public age is dened as the number of years since the rm appeared in the Compustat data-
set, and is unrelated to the length of period the rm was private before becoming public.
When considering the distribution of ages per scale in panel (b), we see the median public
age of smaller rms is lower than 10 while the median age of the largest rms is closer to 30.
Nevertheless, there is much dispersion in ages at the largest rm bin, with the 10thpercentile
of the age distribution below 10 years and the 90thpercentile above 50. This relation is much
crisper when one \ips" the gure and considers the scale distribution as a function of public
age. Panel (c) exhibits a strong linear relation between public age and median scale, with
median rm scale growing by 0 :076 for every year of survival. These panels cannot however
ascertain whether rms that survive grow or whether large rms survive.
Panels (d)+(e) attend to this question, by considering the probability of exit and of entry
by rm scale, respectively. Exit probability is strongly decreasing in scale, with about 15%
probability of exiting the sample every year for the smallest scale bin and about 2% for the
largest. The probability of entry by scale is similar, though has a faster decline (in logs).
The uni-variate relation between exit probability and age depicted in Panel (f) appears to
be an artifact of the relation between age and scale and the relation between scale and exit
probability. The longevity of the largest rms has to do more with the fact that large rms
have a lower hazard rate than the fact small rms take long to become large. This fact is also
ascertained when one considers double-binning observations by scale and age, and regressing
exit probability within bin on age and scale (unreported). Scale is overwhelmingly the better
predictor of exit probability, and the residual from regressing exit probability on scale is not
explained by age, while the residual of regressing exit probability on age is strongly explained
by scale.
A second way to observe the fact age has limited impact on exit probability is using Panel
(g). The panel plots the (log) number of rms in the pooled data, by rm age. The slope is
uniform by age, and rms have an approximate exit probability of 7.4% per year, which is
49also the pooled unconditional exit probability in the data. I conclude:
Observation 18. Exit probability is strongly decreasing with scale, but there's only a weak
relation between age and exit probability.
Panel (h) is a dierent presentation of the data in panels (d)+(e) | it presents the
distribution of scale at entry and at exit, showing that both exit and entry happen throughout
the FSD, but entering rms are somewhat smaller than exiting rms. Finally, Panel (i)
presents the time-structure of entry/exit probability throughout the sample period, with the
80's and 90's generally showing much higher level of dynamism relative to the 70's, 00's and
10's.
5 Summary
This paper analyzed the data on US public rms in the 50 year period 1970-2019. Firm
distributions that were explored are the scale distribution FSD, income distribution FID,
growth distribution FGD, equity return distribution FGE(EQ), income growth distribution
FIGD, investment distribution FND, as well as rm R&D investment, rm ratios, and rm
dynamism. Special attention was given to scale eects and distributional forms.
The following 18 observations were made:
1. The FSD is distributed skew-Normal.
2. Value and capital scales are highly persistent. Sales and particularly expenses some-
what less so.
3. FSD measures are cointegrated.
4. The FID is distributed DLN.
5. FGD dispersion is systematically decreasing with scale.
506. The FGD is distributed DLN.
7. The FGD(EQ) location and dispersion are increasing and decreasing with scale, re-
spectively.
8. The FGD(EQ) is distributed DLN.
9. The FIGD(CF) has decreasing dispersion with scale and is distributed DLN.
10. Physical depreciation rates are decreasing with scale.
11. The FND is distributed DLN.
12. R&D intensity is non-linearly decreasing with scale.
13. R&D intensity's median is negatively correlated with its skewness.
14. Physical intensity at (non) R&D-performing rms exhibits patterns (similar) opposite
those of R&D intensity.
15. Small and large rms (below and above the median scale) are systematically dierent
from each other.
16. Median debt-to-equity, rm eciency, and total payout ratio grow linearly with scale.
17. Firm scale is highly persistent even in the long-term.
18. Exit probability is strongly decreasing with scale, but there's only a weak relation
between age and exit probability.
While some of the observations were previously documented in the literature, most are (to
the best of my knowledge) new, namely: 4, 6-17. Three main ndings are that the DLN
distribution describes rm outcomes surprisingly well, that decreasing dispersion with scale
is rampant in the data, and that small and large rms are systematically dierent from each
other, possibly relating to their dierent R&D activity proles.
51Observation 7 implies the relation between rm size and return in the data is actually
opposite that posited by Fama and French (1992) and summarized by the "size factor",
though further inquiry using tradeable portfolios is merited. Observation 8 similarly has
signicant asset pricing implications, especially given the large literature suggesting possible
empirical distributions to describe asset returns for use in practical applications such as
options pricing.
Similarly, observations 17, 18, and the entire dynamism discussion in Section 4.4 imply
that "scale is destiny", and rms seldom change their scale signicantly through their life
once becoming public. The process of growing from scale 0 to (approximately) the target
scale for a given rm mostly happens while the rm is private. Furthermore, the relation
between rm survival, size, and age is more complex, and it appears that the longevity of
the largest rms has to do more with the fact that large rms have a lower hazard rate than
the fact small rms take long to become large, thus casting doubt on the learning-by-doing
mechanism.
Finally, the ubiquitous nding that the rm is ruled by the DLN distribution begs for a
clear model explaining how it arises in rm dynamics. The follow-on paper Parham (2022c)
replaces the traditional \Cobb-Douglas" with a DLN production function in an otherwise
standard q-theory model of the rm, and shows that the relevant stylized facts emerge
naturally within the model.

55A Distributional xed-eects
This section describes the use of distributional xed eects. The dimensions of xed
eects I am concerned with are ftime and scalegXflocation and dispersion gxed eects.
A.1 Time xed-eects
The core idea is simply to standardize the yearly distributions prior to pooling them
together. E.g., the transformation
T1(Xi;t) =Xi;t Mean[X;t]
Std[X;t](A.1)
will standardize the distribution of X per year by deating the location and scale of each
observation within the year by the yearly location and scale. The pooled deated observa-
tions are then not subject to the aggregation critique, as it relates to yearly location and
dispersion changes.
A better transformation reates each yearly distribution by the full-sample location and
dispersion. Thus, the pooled adjusted sample maintains its location and dispersion, by using
T2(Xi;t) =Xi;t Mean[X;t]
Std[X;t]Std[X;] + Mean[X;] (A.2)
A second improvement is using median and IQR as measures of location and scale rather
than mean and standard deviation. This is useful when using the transformations to adjust
heavy-tailed distributions, in which the mean and s.d. are signicantly less robust than the
median and IQR. The transformation A.2 then becomes
T3(Xi;t) =Xi;t Median[X;t]
IQR[X;t]IQR[X;] + Median[ X;] (A.3)
Note that the same transformation can also be specied in size (rather than scale) terms,
56i.e., ifY= exp(X), one could equivalently specify the transformation A.3 as
T4(Yi;t) = exp
(log (Yi;t) Median[log( Y;t)])IQR[log(Y;)]
IQR[log(Y;t)]+ Median[log( Y;)]
(A.4)
While the form of the transformation in A.4 appears to needlessly complicate the trans-
formation in A.3, the benet of doing so becomes clear when one considers deating doubly-
exponential Yvariates (e.g., rm income), by the time-trend of the positive part of Y. E.g.,
ifYDLN, we cannot use the transformations in A.3 or A.4. A slight adjustment to A.4
is required,
T5(Yi;t) = sign (Yi;t) exp 
log (jYi;tj) Median[log( Y+
;t)]IQR[log(Y+
;)]
IQR[log(Y+
;t)]+ Median[log( Y+
;)]
(A.5)
In which sign( Y) is the sign step function, with a value of +1 for positive values and -1 for
negative values, and Y+
;tdenotes all positive Y values in time t.
The transformation in A.5 adjusts both positive and negative values, in log dimensions,
and maintains their sign, but does so based on the location and dispersion of positive values.
For the DLN distributions we encounter, upward of 80% of observations are positive. This
allows us to avoid the dubious act of adjusting positive and negative values by dierent
factors.
A.2 Scale xed-eects
As discussed in Section 3.1, most rms measures exhibit scale-dependant heterogeneity
in both location and dispersion. A straightforward adjustment approach would be to adjust
each observation based on its scale bin. I.e., if kindexes bin membership based on some
measure of scale, as in the binscatter plots of Figure 4, then one could adjust for scale eects
57by using the transformation
T6(Xi;t;k) =Xi;t;k Median[X;;k]
IQR[X;;k]IQR[X;;] + Median[ X;;] (A.6)
A better approach, less subject to bias due to the discrete nature of the bins, is to simply
adjust each value based on the tted regression lines between the bins, in the appropriate bin-
scatter. Letting Mi;tdenote a measure of rm size used as the basis for scale-normalization,
dene the following set of transformations:
Tloc
7(Mi;t 1) =loc
0+loc
1log(Mi;t 1)
Tdis
7(Mi;t 1) = exp 
dis

T7(Xi;t;Mi;t 1) =Xi;t Tloc
7(Mi;t 1)
Tdis
7(Mi;t 1)Tdis
7(Median[M;]) +Tloc
7(Median[M;])(A.7)
in whichloc

1are the intercept and slope from a quantile regression for the 50thpercentile
ofXi;ton lagged scale log( Mi;t 1), anddis
0;dis
1are the intercept and slope of regressing
log(IQR[Xi;t]) on log(Mi;t 1) (as in Figure 4). The transformation T7in A.7 is conceptu-
ally equivalent to the transformation in A.6, but is akin to assigning the observations to a
continuum of bins.
