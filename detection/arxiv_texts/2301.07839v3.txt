Conventional lithium-ion batteries, and many next-generation technologies, rely on organic elec-
trolytes with multiple solvents to achieve the desired physicochemical and interfacial properties.
The complex interplay between these properties can often be elucidated via the coordination envi-
ronment of the cation. We develop a theory for the coordination shell of cations in non-aqueous
solvent mixtures that can be applied with high delity, up to super-concentrated electrolytes. Our
theory can naturally explain simulation and experimental values of cation solvation in \classical"
non-aqueous electrolytes. Moreover, we utilise our theory to understand general design principles of
emerging classes of non-aqueous electrolyte mixtures, such as high entropy electrolytes. It is hoped
that this theory provides a systematic framework to understand simulations and experiments which
engineer the solvation structure and ionic associations of concentrated non-aqueous electrolytes.
I. INTRODUCTION
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have transformed our
everyday lives through myriad portable electronic de-
vices [1{8]. Although current LIBs are tremendously suc-
cessful, further development is necessary to meet safety
and performance requirements for widespread use of
electric vehicles and grid-level energy storage of renew-
able energy [4{8]. Thus, much of electrochemical en-
ergy storage research is focused on improving the ma-
terials beyond commercial LIBs, including high volt-
age and high capacity cathode materials [9], silicon an-
odes [10], lithium metal anodes [11{13], and even non-
lithium based battery chemistries [14{16]. A requirement
of any next-generation battery chemistry is an electrolyte
that can operate safely, eciently and reversibly over the
course of the battery's lifetime [1{8].
One of the primary design concepts in electrolyte en-
gineering is balancing desired, often seemingly conict-
ing, physicochemical properties, such as low viscosity
and high conductivity, with interfacial properties, such
as low charge transfer resistance and electrode passiva-
tion [4]. Commercial LIBs accomplish this design con-
cept, to some extent, with blends of linear carbonates,
such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC) for low viscosity, and
cyclic carbonates, such as ethylene carbonate (EC) to
passivate carbonaceous anodes [1{8, 17]. Although car-
bonate blends provide a serviceable solution, electrolyte
design for LIBs is far from optimized [4{8].
An important advance in electrolyte engineering over
the past decade has been the link of ion solvation chem-
istry to electrolyte properties [8, 18{23]. On one hand,
zachary.goodwin13@imperial.ac.ukat low salt concentrations, solvent dominated coordina-
tion shells ensure a nearly complete dissociation of salt,
enabling ecient ion transport. However, even at low
concentrations, when multiple types of solvent are used, a
cation's solvation structure can be tuned via the bulk sol-
vent ratios to produce very dierent solid-electrolyte in-
terphases (SEIs) to passivate the working electrodes [19].
This is in large part due to the increased reactivity,
from reduced LUMO levels, of solvent molecules that are
in direct contact with lithium. At higher salt concen-
trations, the introduction of anions to the coordination
shell tends to decrease ionic conductivity and increase
concentration overpotentials [1, 2]. However, in some
cases, highly passivating inorganic anion-derived (as op-
posed to solvent-derived) SEIs can form, resulting in an
overall increase in cell performance [24]. Furthermore,
across all salt concentrations and solvent ratios, the solva-
tion/desolvation dynamics governing charge transfer re-
sistance will be subject to large changes depending on
the species comprising the coordination shells of cations
in the electrolyte [7, 8].
In fact, next-generation electrolytes are engineered to
tune the solvation shell of cations, and therefore physico-
chemical and interfacial properties of the electrolytes [4{
8, 13, 25]. For example, localized high-concentration elec-
trolytes (LHCE) [14{16, 26{29] use typical salts, such
as uoro-sulfonamides, in high ratios with ether sol-
vents which historically showed promising compatibility
with lithium metal anodes, such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane,
but which are notoriously limited in terms of oxida-
tive stability [30{33]. The singular aspect of LHCE's
is their use of diluents, generally in the form of uori-
nated ethers, which are non-solvating, but highly oxida-
tively stable [14{16, 26{29]. Thus, the non-uorinated
solvent and anion are mostly retained in the lithium coor-
dination shell, where it has enhanced oxidative stability,arXiv:2301.07839v3  [cond-mat.soft]  3 Mar 20232
while the uorinated ether diluent strictly appears out-
side of the lithium coordination shell, serving to lubricate
the electrolyte (decrease viscosity) while remaining stable
against both electrodes [14{16, 26{29]. However, a major
issue in engineering such next-generation electrolytes is
knowing exactly how the solvation shell of the cations will
be eected by the mixtures which are created to balance
the physicochemical and interfacial properties, as they
are often not just an average of their neat properties.
To probe the solvation structure of electrolytes, spec-
troscopic techniques [1, 2, 8] such as Fourier-transform
infrared [34], Raman [35{37], nuclear magnetic reso-
nance [38] and mass spectrometry [19, 39], have been
employed to give some insight. However, atomistic sim-
ulations, including molecular dynamics (MD) [19, 40{51]
and density functional theory (DFT) [35, 44, 50{52], are
typically relied on to give detailed insight into ion solva-
tion. An advantage of DFT is predicting HOMO/LUMO
levels of dierent species, and therefore, their expected
reactivity; in addition to understanding the spectra from
dierent techniques [35]. However, DFT is computation-
ally expensive, and often limited to short length and time
scales (when performing ab initio MD) [52]. To reach
larger scales, MD simulations are indispensable in under-
standing solvation structures and dynamics of ions but
the accuracy and delity of the force eld often comes
under question [19, 40{51]. Recent advances in machine
learning force elds could oer the accuracy of DFT with
the time/length scales of classical force elds [53, 54].
However, a systematic way to report solvation structures
has not emerged, with practically every study reporting
results in a dierent way, making it dicult to compare
dierent works systematically [6]. Moreover, atomistic
simulations can make predictions of specic systems, but
they are not able to provide a general understanding that
a simple, analytical theory often does.
In this paper, we develop a theory for the solvation
structure and ionic associations of concentrated non-
aqueous electrolytes. This theory is based on McEl-
drew et al. 's [55{58] recent generalisation of Flory [59{
64], Stockmayer [65{67] and Tanaka's [68{76] work on re-
versible aggregation and gelation in polymer systems to
concentrated electrolytes. Our theory only has a handful
of physically transparent parameters, all of which can be
obtained directly from atomistic simulations. To demon-
strate this parameterization, we perform MD simulations
of a \classical" non-aqueous electrolyte, 1M LiPF 6in a
mixture of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate
and compare the results to our theory. Overall, our the-
ory is able to naturally explain the solvation structure
of this electrolyte for all the studied mixtures. Having
benchmarked our theory against a well studied system,
we utilise \toy models" of our theory to understand the
design principles of emerging next-generation LIB elec-
trolytes. The theory is able to provide a depth of under-
standing, which is indispensable in aiding design princi-
ples of these electrolytes. Moreover, the theory provides
a systematic framework for simulation techniques to re-port their results, which we hope will be adopted to bring
more transparency to the eld.
II. THEORY
The central idea that the presented work is based
on, is the analogy between concentrated electrolytes and
polymers. In concentrated electrolytes, past the Kirk-
wood transition [77], electrostatic correlations between
ions causes the aggregation of oppositely charged ions
into structures with alternating spatial order of oppo-
sitely charged ions [55, 78]. Conceptually, this is simi-
lar to the formation of an alternating co-polymer of two
monomers. The realisation of this analogy actually has
a long history, with one of the rst connections being
the similarity between the liquid-vapour phase diagram
of ions in their high temperature gas state and the phase
diagram of polymers in solution, as rst discussed from
a general stand point by Pitzer [79, 80]. Simulations
of the phase behavior of ions in their high temperature
dissociated state, based on the so-called restricted prim-
itive model [81], have directly revealed the formation
of chains of ions [82, 83], although this eect has not
been quantied in relation to understanding the phase
boundary shape. The resemblance of these phase dia-
grams is thought to occur because of the similarity be-
tween polymers and uids of dipolar particles [84, 85] to
self-assemble into dynamic polymer chains (\equilibrium
polymers"), and also between dipolar uids and ionic u-
ids, owing to the association of ions into dipolar and mul-
tipolar clusters [84, 86]. There are also many examples
of the observation of chains, rings and branched ionic
aggregates, amongst other morphologies, forming in sim-
ulations of electrolytes [82, 83, 87{93]. We note that
the polymeric chains of ions have been found in simula-
tions of ion clusters that are thought to be important in
biomineralization [94].
Here, as in our previous works [55{58], we develop and
adapt the theories of Flory-Stockmayer-Tanaka for ther-
moreversible polymerisation and apply it to LIB elec-
trolytes, where solvent molecules play an essential role in
the molecular aggregation behaviour, further establish-
ing the analogy between concentrated electrolytes and
polymers. In fact, this is not the rst time that inspira-
tion from polymer-based models has been used to further
deepen the analogy between electrolytes and polymers. A
notable example comes from Bastea [87], who developed
a simple theory of the formation of chains and rings com-
prising of alternating cations/anions that was observed in
MD simulations of a highly size asymmetric electrolyte.
The inspiration for Bastea's theory for these structures
came from models for worm-like surfactant micelles [95],
with Bastea assuming the monomer unit was a neutral
ion pair.
The connection between Flory-Stockmayer-Tanaka
theories has already been made with \patchy parti-
cle" or \spot model" systems, where a particle has a3
xed number of patches/spots that can favourably in-
teract with the patches/spots of other particles, forming
thermoreverisble associations [96{107]. Similarly, Stock-
mayer uids, particles interacting with Lennard-Jones
potentials with additional directional potentials, such as
dipolar (or higher order) interactions, have also been
shown to form thermoreversible associations [84, 85].
These simulation approaches are not limited to the mean-
eld approximation with Cayley trees, but the mean-
eld theories of Flory-Stockmayer-Tanaka with Cay-
ley trees have successfully been used to understand
the aggregation and gelation of patchy colloidal parti-
cles [100, 101, 103{105, 108]. Recently, systems of oppo-
sitely charged (patchy) nanoparticles were synthesis and
mixed together, forming alternating aggregates of posi-
tively and negatively charged nanoparticles [109{111].
Here, we develop a theory for a \classical" non-aqueous
electrolyte - 1M LiPF 6dissolved in a mixture of ethylene
carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) - because
of its importance in LIBs [1, 2]. While this is used as
an example here, the theory is not limited to specically
this system, and can be adapted for a wide variety of
electrolytes, up to extremely high salt concentrations.
It is assumed that the cations bind with the anions
and solvent molecules, but no other species bind with
each other, i.e. no binding between anion and the sol-
vents (although this can be taken into account [55]) or
between solvent molecules (which has been considered
elsewhere [112]). This non-aqueous electrolyte is consid-
ered to form a polydisperse mixture of ionic clusters of
ranklmsq , containing lcations,manions,sEC solvent
molecules and qPC solvent molecules, of which there are
Nlmsq [55].
The cations can form a maximum of f+associations
and the anions a maximum of f associations, referred to
as their functionality. The solvent molecules are assumed
to have a functionality of 1. The cations and anions
are able to form extended clusters (because f>2 for
LiPF 6) [89]. However, as the concentration of the salt is
relatively low and the interactions between the solvents
and Li cations strong, a percolating ionic network (gel)
should not form at ambient conditions [55]. Therefore,
for simplicity, we neglect the formation of the gel for 1M
LiPF 6in EC/PC, and refer readers to Refs. 55{58 to see
how it is included.
The electrolyte is assumed to form Cayley tree clus-
ters [55, 58, 113]. The cations and anions form the \back-
bone of the branched aggregates", and the \dangling as-
sociation sites" from this backbone can either be left
empty or can be decorated with the solvent molecules,
or the strong solvent-cation interactions can break apart
the ionic backbone. These Cayley tree clusters have no
intra-cluster loops, with the number of each type of bond
being uniquely determined by the rank of the cluster,
lmsq .
In Fig. 1 a schematic of some example clusters for the
studied system are displayed, where the cations and an-
ions have a functionality of 3. The cluster of rank 1300 is
FIG. 1. Schematic showing the notation of dierent species.
The upper panel shows cations, anions, and the two solvents,
with overall quantities denoted by + ; ;x;y, respectively, and
individual species in clusters by l;m;s;q , respectively. Free
cations, anions and xandysolvents are denoted by the rank
labels 1000, 0100, 0010 and 0001, respectively. In the bottom
panel, example clusters are shown, where dotted lines are used
to enclose each cluster.
comprised of 1 cation and 3 anions, which has an overall
 2 negative charge, cannot bind to any solvent molecules
from the lack of open cation association sites. For 1011,
the cation is bound to both solvent molecules, and there
is a dangling association site which could bind to an an-
ion or another solvent molecule to create a cluster of a
larger rank. Finally, the cluster of rank 1120 is a cation-
anion ion pair, where the cation is also bound to two of
thessolvent molecules. These are just some examples of
cluster to demonstrate the possible allowed clusters.
The assumption of Cayley tree clusters is an essen-
tial requirement of the presented theory, enabling simple
analytical results, but it is important to note its poten-
tial limitations. This assumption only appears to work
if there is at least one species that is disorder-forming.
If there are only order-forming species, then the ionic
aggregates that form will be crystalline in nature and
have a signicant number of loops [112]. For exam-
ple, molten/concentrated NaCl only contains spherical,
highly symmetric ions, both of which are order form-
ing, and the resulting clusters that form a crystalline-
like [88, 112]. If, however, the anion is a uoro-
sulfonamide, the aggregates which form are no longer
crystalline-like, but do in fact resemble Cayley trees, as
we have previously shown [56{58]. Therefore, the pre-
sented theory is not applicable to all electrolytes.
A natural question to ask is if this assumption works
for LIB electrolytes. In \classical" non-aqueous elec-
trolytes the salt is often LiPF 6, which might be thought
to be order-forming species, as both cation and anion
have high symmetry. In the context of salt-in-ionic liq-
uids, we have shown that the Cayley tree assumption can
actually be used to represent the small clusters formed in4
that system [58]. Moreover in Ref. 17, 4 M LiPF 6in EC
was studied from MD simulations and experiments, and
it was shown that branched, Cayley-tree-like aggregates
form. In the context of next-generation electrolytes, dis-
ordered anions are often used due to their high solubility,
which suggests that our theory should be applicable to
these systems [114]. Moreover, the carbonate solvents are
not highly symmetric species and strongly interact with
the cation, which should break up any large ionic aggre-
gates in favour of small solvation structures. Therefore,
we believe the assumption of Cayley tree clusters should
be justied for most LIB electrolytes.
In the presented theory, there are N+Li+cations and
N [PF6] anions, and from electroneutrality in the bulk
N+=N . This salt is dissolved in a mixture of EC
and PC, of which there are NxandNy, respectively. As
described above and shown in Fig. 1, these species can
form a polydisperse mixture of clusters of dierent ranks,
of which there are Nlmsq. The theory assumes the elec-
trolyte to be an incompressible lattice uid (this is not an
essential requirement, but is taken for convenience, and
does not change any results here), with a single lattice
site having the volume of a Li cation, v+[55]. Anions
occupy =v =v+lattice sites, and the solvents oc-
cupyx=y=vx=y=v+lattice sites. Note that the volumes
of each species only explicitly appear in the volume frac-
tions, and the dierent shapes of species are not explicitly
accounted for. The total number of lattice sites is given
by

 =X
lmsq(l+ m+xs+yq)Nlmsq: (1)
Dividing through by the total number of lattice sites gives
1 =X

Hereclmsq=Nlmsq=
 is the dimensionless concentration
of almsq cluster (the number of lmsq clusters per lattice
site), andlmsq is the volume fraction of clusters of rank
lmsq . The volume fraction of each species is determined
through
i=X
lmsqijclmsq; (3)
wherej=l;m;s;q fori= +; ;x;y, respectively, and
+= 1. The incompressibility condition can also be
stated as
1 =++ +x+y: (4)
Based on the works of Flory [59{64], Stockmayer [65{
67] and Tanaka [68{76], and our previous application of
this theory to concentrated electrolytes [55{58, 113, 115],
the free energy is taken to be
F=X
lmsq[NlmsqkBTln (lmsq) +Nlmsqlmsq];(5)where the rst term is the ideal entropy of each cluster
of ranklmsq , and the second term is the free energy
of forming those clusters, with  lmsq denoting the free
energy of formation for a cluster of rank lmsq [55], which
has three contributions
lmsq= bind
lmsq+ comb
lmsq + conf
lmsq; (6)
where bind
lmsqis the binding energy, comb
lmsq is the combina-
torial entropy, and conf
lmsqis the congurational entropy.
The binding energy of a cluster, bind
lmsq, is uniquely
dened by the rank lmsq , owing to the assumption of
Cayley tree clusters. For l >0, the binding energy of a
cluster is
bind
lmsq= (l+m 1)u+ +su+x+qu+y;(7)
where uii0= ui0iis the energy of an association be-
tweeniandi0. Whenl= 0, the binding energy of a
cluster is 0.
Physically, the cation-anion associations are driven by
their strong electrostatic interactions [55]. These associ-
ations are a representation of short-range electrostatic
correlations beyond mean-eld [55{58, 116{118], with
Levy et al. [78] showing that only retaining short-ranged
correlations in concentrated systems is sucient to re-
produce the spatial arrangements of concentrated elec-
trolytes. The fact that we have neglected long-ranged
electrostatic interactions between dierent clusters , relies
on the assumption that the majority of the electrostatic
energy is incorporated in the formation of the ionic clus-
ters (via this binding contribution), as opposed to be-
tween dierent clusters. Moreover, the electrolyte is at
a concentration where the activity coecient of the salt
is typically larger than 1 [2], which motivates the ex-
clusion of further electrostatic energy terms, with our
theory predicting such values of activity coecients for
concentrated electrolytes [55, 57]. The cation-solvent as-
sociations are driven by the strong interactions between
Li and the carbonyl oxygen. It is assumed that cation-
solvent interactions are the dominant contribution to the
free energy of solvation, instead of, say, the Born solva-
tion energy.
The combinatorial entropy of each cluster of rank lmsq
is given by
comb
lmsq = kBTln
fl
+fm
 Wlmsq	
; (8)
where
Wlmsq=(f+l l)!(f m m)!
l!m!s!q!(f+l l m s q+ 1)!:(9)
This entropic term was rst derived by Stockmayer for
applications in polymers [67]. It only depends on the
number of each species in a cluster, since it is a measure
of the number of ways in which a cluster of rank lmsq
can be arranged.
The congurational entropy is associated with build-
ing the aggregate from its constituent parts on a lattice,5
which depends on the volumes of each species. This con-
tribution is not universal, and can depend on how \fex-
ible" the associations are [56]. Importantly, this contri-
bution, in the end, produces a term that depends on
the number of associations in a cluster, which means
it contributes to the entropy change of an association ,
as seen in the association constant later. The binding
energy and congurational entropy could, therefore, be
combined into a single binding free energy, but for his-
torical reasons we have not described the theory in this
way. We refer the reader to Ref. 56 for further details of
the congurational entropy, where the temperature de-
pendence was studied.
Establishing chemical equilibria, as shown in Ref. 55,
the dimensionless concentration of a cluster of rank lmsq ,
withl>0, is given by
clmsq=Wlmsq
 ( l )l( m )m( sx)s( qy)q;
(10)
where l=f+1000=+and m=f+0100=+are num-
ber of association sites per lattice site for free cations
and free anions, respectively, and  s=0010=xand
 q=0001=yare number of association sites per lattice
site for the free solvent xandy, respectively. The as-
sociation constant between species iand cations is given
by
i=e f+i=e [u+i Ts+i]; (11)
whereis inverse thermal energy, and  s+iis the en-
tropy change of an association, as determined by the
congurational entropy [55, 56]. Note i6= + in these
equations, as no cation-cation associations are consid-
ered. When l= 0 andm= 1 (orm= 0 andl= 0), and
s=q= 0, Eq. (10) yields the correct limit for free anions
(cations). For l= 0, the free volume fractions of xand
yare separately dened, as bind
0010= bind
0001= 0, which is
not a limit of Eq. (7).
Here, the associations constants are the main parame-
ters of the theory that need to be determined. As shown
in the next section, and in our previous works [56{58],
these parameters of the theory are readily determined
from the ensemble average coordination numbers. There-
fore, the theory does not contain any free parameters
which can be arbitrarily tted. In principle, as has been
utilised in patchy particle systems, the Wertheim theory
can be employed to have a parameter-free model [104{
107, 119{124]. This theory requires that a reference hard
sphere pair correlation function and the Mayer function
for the interacting species is known. As we are applying
the theory to LIB electrolytes, which contain complex
molecular species, we believe using the association con-
stants as parameters to be found by performed MD sim-
ulations, and using the theory to understand the results
of these simulations in more depth, is more appropriate
than making a priori predictions for these electrolytes.
The volume fractions of each freespecies is (usually)
not a known input, however. In fact, these quantitiesare often what we aim to determine from the theory. To
overcome this seemingly circular problem, the free vol-
ume fraction of each species can be related to the total
volume fraction of that species, the number of bonds that
species can make to the other species, and the probability
of the associations [55]. The probability of species ibe-
ing associated to species jis given by pij, the number of
associations was previously dened as the functionality,
and the total volume fractions of each species is known.
For free cations 1000=+(1 P
ip+i)f+, for free an-
ions0100= (1 p +)f , and for free solvent we have
0010=x(1 px+) and0001=y(1 py+).
The association probabilities are related through the
conservation of associations and mass action laws. The
conservation of associations states
 +p+i= ipi+=  i; (12)
where  iis the number of + iassociations per lattice site,
and i=fii=i=ficiis the number of association sites
of speciesiper lattice site. Again, note i6= + in these
equations, which means for the 4-component system be-
ing discussed, there are 3 sets of these equations. Sim-
ilarly, the set of 3 mass action laws for the associations
are generally given by
i i=pi+p+i
(1 P
i0p+i0)(1 pi+): (13)
By solving the set of equations described by Eqs. (12) and
(13), one can determine the association probabilities, and
therefore the volume fraction of free species and the clus-
ter distribution. For the 4-component system, numerical
solutions are required. For the assumption that there is
no gel, (f+ 1)(f  1)> p+ p +must hold, as this
inequality determines the percolation point on a Bethe
lattice [55].
In the context of polymers, Tanaka [68] introduce the
mass action laws to describe the thermorevrsible nature
of the bonds. In electrolytes, the use of mass action laws
to describe the equilibrium association has a long history,
starting from Arrhenius and Bjerrum pairs [125]. Since
those early works, it has been employed countless times
to model ion pairing eects [125]. Therefore, the theory
presented here is an extension of these works, where we
are able to account for much larger ionic aggregates in a
systematic way, in addition to including solvation eects,
and not requiring aggregates to be neutral.
Having outlined the basic equations, before studying
the example of non-aqueous electrolytes in detail, we be-
lieve it is prudent that some intuition is outlined from
limiting cases. It is suggested that the reader also goes
through our general theory [55], and special cases for
ionic liquids [56, 113, 115], water-in-salt electrolytes [57]
and salt-in-ionic liquids [58], as these contain a lot of de-
tails of the ionic associations not shown here. Let us take
f+i= 0 for all i, which would correspond to  i= 1.
In such a case, despite the free energy of an association
being zero, the association probabilities are nite, which6
means there is a distribution of clusters of various ranks.
This occurs because of the ideal entropy of mixing and
the combinatorial entropy each cluster drives the forma-
tion of more types of clusters with more dierent com-
ponents in them, as this increases the entropy [55, 113].
We know, however, from Flory's lattice expression for
the entropy of disorientation [62, 63], that  s+i>0.
At low temperature, the negative binding energies dom-
inate, and  i>1, but at high temperatures the entropy
term dominates and  i0. In this latter limit, the clus-
ters dissociate, and we are left with only free species, with
the ideal entropy of each species reducing down to the en-
tropy of mixing of dierent species on a lattice [55, 113].
III. CATION SOLVATION IN CLASSICAL
NON-AQUEOUS ELECTROLYTES
To test our theories ability to understand cation sol-
vation, we perform atomistic MD simulations using
LAMMPS [126, 127] of LiPF 6in mixtures of EC and
PC. For each simulation, we have 83 Li cations and 83
PF6anions. In addition, there are (83, 167, 250, 333,
417, 500, 583, 667, 750) EC and (750, 667, 583, 500,
417, 333, 250, 167, 83) PC solvent molecules. The initial
congurations for all simulations were generated using
PACKMOL [128]. An initial energy minimisation was
performed before equilibrating the bulk, periodic system.
The production run used to analyse the associations in
this system were run at 300 K in an NVT ensemble (the
volume of the simulation box was determined from NPT
equilibration at 1 bar) for 10 ns with a 1 fs time step.
We employed the CL&P force eld for Li cations and
PF6anions [129], with the van der Waals radius of
Li cations set to 1 :44A [46]. For EC and PC, the
OPLS/AA force elds were utilised [130{133], which
are commonly used for simulations of these electrolytes.
Long range electrostatic interactions were computed us-
ing the particle-particle particle-mesh solver (with a cut-
o length of 12 A).
It has been shown numerous times, and as found here,
that the pair correlation function (or cumulative coor-
dination number) of Li-O (carbonyl), has a large peak
(sharp increase) at 2A, with a pronounced minimum
(long plateau) at 3A until a moderate second peak at
4 5A [45, 46, 48]. The Li-O (ether), in contrast, has
its rst large peak at 3A. Therefore, it is natural to
dene a EC/PC solvent molecule to be in the coordina-
tion shell if the Li-O (carbonyl) separation is less than
2.5A. Whereas, the Li-F pair correlation function (cu-
mulative coordination number) often has much smaller
peak(s) (much steadier increase) at 3  4A, despite the
van der Waals radius of F (in the employed MD sim-
ulation) only being only slightly larger than O [45{48].
Therefore, we shall focus solely on the solvents in the
cation coordination shell, not delving into the informa-
tion about cation-anion association in this section.

tween Li and EC/PC, we computed the ensemble av-
erage coordination number of Li cations, Niwhereiis
one of these solvent molecules, for the various mixtures of
EC/PC. The results of this simulation analysis are shown
in Fig. 2, plotted as a function of the mole fraction of EC
to the total mole fraction of solvent, nEC. We nd that
theNECincreases monotonically with nECandNPCde-
creases monotonically with nEC, as might be expected
from an increasing proportion of EC. Their dependence
onnECis non-linear, but the sum of the solvents in the
coordination shell of Li remains to be 4 for allnEC.
The composition of the rst coordination shell of Li is
a quantity which is often calculated from simulations. It
provides insight into the interactions in the system, and
is often correlated with certain behaviours of the elec-
trolyte, such as the conductivity or SEI forming abilities.
Moreover, within our theory, the ensemble average coor-
dination numbers is a key quantity in determining the
association probabilities, Ni=f+p+i, i.e. the function-
ality (maximum coordination number) of Li multiplied
by the probability that Li is associated to igives the co-
ordination number of that species. In Fig. 2, it is clear
thatf+= 4. Therefore, the association probabilities of
cations binding to other species, p+i, can be readily de-
termined, and from Eq. (12) the association probabilities
of species binding to Li, pi+, can be found.
To progress further, we make a few simplications.
Firstly, we assume that the volume of EC and PC
molecules are the same, and therefore, the volume frac-
tion of LiPF 6is constant (note this is not a necessary
assumption, and doesn't change the results signicantly,
but it is done for convenience). Secondly, the total Li
coordination number was consistently 4, which means Li
practically had no \dangling bonds" because the inter-
actions between Li and the solvents are so energetically
favourable. This means the probability of Li binding to
solvents is equal to unity, 1 = p+x+p+y, which we refer
to as the \sticky cation" approximation [57]. From in-
specting Eq. (13), with only solvent molecules included in7

the summation over i0, it should be clear there is singular
behaviour because the probability of an open cation site,
which is 0 in the sticky cation approximation, sits in the
denominator of the equation. This singular behaviour
needs to be removed from the system of equations. By
dividing the mass action laws between Li and the two
dierent solvents, we arrive at
x
y=~ =px+(1 py+)
py+(1 px+); (14)
which is no longer singular. Using this equation, in ad-
dition to 1 = p+x+p+y, permits an analytical solution

When ~>1, the associations between Li and EC is
favoured over Li and PC ( x>y), and when ~<1
the associations between Li and PC is favoured over Li
and EC ( y>x). The other factor in determining the
association probabilities is the amount of each species.
Therefore, in the sticky cation approximation, we only
have a single parameter of the theory which needs to be
determined from the MD simulations.
In Fig. 3 we show the probabilities computed from the
values ofNi=f+obtained from our MD simulations as a
function of nEC. Using these probabilities we can com-
pute ~ from Eq. (14) at each nECand take the average of
the obtained values. We nd ~ = 0:135, which indicates
that PC has more favourable associations with Li than
EC (which can also be seen in Fig. 3 from py+>px+for
allnEC). Now that ~ has been determined, and there are
no other free parameters of the theory, Eqs. (15) and (16)
can be used to predict the association probabilities for
any value of the variable nEC. In Fig. 3 we show that
these probabilities match the simulated values extremely
well. Therefore, our simple, analytical theory can allow
us to naturally understand the solvation structure com-
petition of concentrated Li electrolytes. Having under-
stood the association probabilities, we can now turn to
the distributions of solvation structures.

FIG. 4. Coordination probability of sEC molecules, cs=+,
as a function of nEC. The same set of parameters as Fig. 3 is
used for the lines.
In Fig. (4) we display the probability of sEC solvent
molecules in the coordination shell of the Li from the
simulations, for s= 0;:::;4 as a function of nEC. For
s= 0, i.e. Li only being solvated by PC, the probability
of this solvation structure is initially close to 1, and it
monotonically decreases with increasing nEC. Whereas,
s= 1;2;3, i.e. mixed EC and PC solvation structures, all
have a non-monotonic dependence on nEC, where they8
go through a maximum at intermediate nEC. Finally,
s= 4, i.e. only EC associated to Li, monotonically in-
creases with nEC, where it is the largest component in
the coordination shell at the largest nEC.
To investigate the solvation distribution from the the-
ory, the singular behaviour needs to be removed from
Eq. (10) in the sticky cation approximation. Using
1 =p+x+p+y,f+=s+q, and Eq. (14), we can ar-
rive at
cs
+=f+!
s!(f+ s)!ps
+x(1 p+x)f+ s; (17)
which is the probability of sEC solvent molecules in
the coordination shell of the Li, with csbeing used as
a shorthand for c10sq. An equivalent expression for the
probability of qPC solvent molecules in the coordination
shell of the Li, cp, can be derived, which is also simply
cp=+= 1 cs=+. Equation (17) is clearly the number
of ways of arranging a solvation shell with sEC andq
PC solvent molecules, multiplied by the probability that
ssolvent molecules are bound to the Li and the proba-
bility of the remaining f+ sPC molecules being bound
to Li, i.e. it is simply a binomial distribution of the two
solvent molecules.
In Fig. (4) we also plot the probability of sEC
molecules in the coordination shell of Li from the the-
ory, using the value of ~ extracted from the simulations.
Overall, we nd good agreement between the theory and
simulation. The theory allows us to understand this de-
pendence of cs=+onnEC. Fors= 0, Eq. (17) reduces
topf+
+y, and fors=f+= 4, we arrive at pf+
+x, which
are clearly the probability of f+PC and EC molecules
binding to the Li cation, respectively. As can be un-
derstood from Fig. 3, these functions, pf+
+yandpf+
+x, are
monotonically decreasing and monotonically increasing,
respectively. For all values of sbetween these limits,
bothp+xand 1 p+xoccur in the expressions, which
requires that csgoes to zero at the limits of nEC, and
that a maximum occurs between these limits. If ~ = 1,
thes= 2 case would peak at nEC= 1=2, but because
~<1 the peak occurs at nEC>1=2 as clusters with PC
is favoured and larger concentrations of EC are required
to reach this point. This demonstrates that the binomial
distribution is skewed based on the relative interactions
of the solvents with Li.
A. Experimental Comparison
In Ref. 19 mass spectra of 1M LiPF 6in mixtures
of non-aqueous solvents were measured. As the elec-
trolyte is vaporised and ionised from the liquid state,
it is thought that most of the strong associations stay in
tact, and therefore, the mass spectrum can provide infor-
mation of the distribution of solvation structures in the
liquid electrolyte. Therefore, the solvation structure of
cations is a physical observable which we can directlycompare our theory against. In Fig. 5 we reproduce
Ref. 19 values for the fraction of EC in the solvation shell,
i.e.NEC=f+, for EC/PC and EC/DMC mixtures, as a
function of the mole fraction of EC relative to the mole
fraction of total solvent. In addition, we reproduce the
values simulated from the previous section. As we know
p+x=NEC=f+from experiments, assuming the sticky
cation approximation, we are able to calculate values of
~ for the experiments, and compare our theory against
these values.
For EC/PC mixtures, the values of NEC=f+from sim-
ulations and experiments are quite similar. In the exper-
iments, it was noted that only up to 3 solvent molecules
coordinating were found. The discrepancy between simu-
lations and experiments as to whether a maximum of 3 or
4 solvent molecules can coordinate lithium in these car-
bonate blends was discussed in Ref. 19 and thought to be
an attribute of the electrospray ionization technique only
retaining the most tightly bound species. Therefore, for
the experimental data we use f+= 3, and we found that
f+= 4 the tted curves signicantly worse than f+= 3.
Based on this functionality, we calculated ~ = 0:0978 for
the experiments, which is similar to the value obtained
from the simulations. This value of ~ indicates that the
PC-Li associations are more favourable than the EC-Li
associations, which is evident from the curves being be-
low the diagonal dotted line which corresponds to equal
numbers of EC/PC in the coordination shell of Li.

from Cresce et al. in Ref. 19 and our simulations from the
previous section are shown. Also from Ref. 19, the EC/DMC
mixtures are also displayed. The values of the parameters for
the theory were computed from the association probabilities
p+x=NEC=f+. For the experimental values, we take f+= 3
as it ts the values signicantly better, and we nd ~ = 0:0978
for EC/PC and ~ = 26:7 for EC/DMC. All other values were
kept the same as that in Fig. 3
On the other hand, for the EC/DMC mixtures, the
EC-Li associations are favoured over the DMC-Li associ-
ations, and soNEC=f+resides above the diagonal. The9
value of ~ = 26:7 extracted from the experimental data
is now larger than 1, demonstrating the more favourable
EC-Li associations. Therefore, the value of ~ is a clear,
physical parameter which describes the competition be-
tween the solvation structure of Li electrolytes. Again,
f+= 3 did a signicantly better job at reproducing the
data thanf+= 4.
There are many examples of simulations which show
similar trends to those reported in Refs. 19. While there
can be some dierences in the reported experimental or
predicted values from simulations, with and without as-
sociations between cations-anions, we wish to stress that
our theory should be able to capture the behaviour of all
these systems, provided the assumptions of the theory
are valid. What changes is the exact volume fractions of
species, association constants, functionalities, etc.
IV. BEYOND CLASSICAL NON-AQUEOUS
ELECTROLYTES
In previous sections, we focused on cation solvation
in common non-aqueous electrolytes that are studied
primarily for use in commercial LIBs. We chose this
electrolyte because it has been extensively studied, and
the coordination structure is qualitatively agreed upon.
While these electrolytes are commonly and successfully
used in commercial LIBs, moderately concentrated car-
bonate blend electrolytes generally do not perform well
in many next-generation battery technologies [4{8]. For
such applications, there are many emerging classes of
electrolyte currently being explored in literature, where
our developed theory can be adapted for [4{8, 89, 134].
In this section, we utilise our theory to under-
stand some \design principles" of several classes of
next-generation electrolytes currently being investigated.
Note we have only picked a few examples to discuss here
to demonstrate the theories ability, with an exhaustive
comparison being left for future work. We mainly focus
on \toy models" of the theory for these electrolytes, de-
tails of which are shown in the Appendix, and we do not
perform simulations to back up these ndings, but hope
these results inspire further investigation of these sys-
tems. For brevity, we will not review in detail why these
next-generation electrolytes are of interest or their exact
chemistries, but refer readers to where this information
can be found.
A. Localized high-concentration electrolytes
The design of localized high-concentration electrolytes
(LHCE) { the reader is referred to Ref. 28 for a review {
starts from nding a promising highly concentrated elec-
trolyte (HCE), typically just a salt dissolved in a solvent
that solvates the cation strongly. This HCE is then di-
luted with a solvent which does not solvate the cation,
known as the diluent, in an attempt to preserve the co-ordination structure of the cation (see Introduction for
why this is important). Therefore, the lithium coordina-
tion shell { likely invaded by anions { resembles one that
could typically be obtained at only high salt concentra-
tions in 2-component mixtures. From the perspective of
the lithium ions in solution, the electrolyte is \locally"
concentrated.
From our toy model, shown in Appendix A, we nd
that the design principle of LHCE is supported by our
theory, under certain approximations. In the sticky
cation approximation, the addition of a diluent, which
does not interact with any other species, leaves the coor-
dination shell of the cations unchanged, despite the dilu-
tion eect. If the sticky cation approximation is not em-
ployed, the predictions of the theory sensitively depend
on the assumed association constants, and therefore, we
do not make any predictions for this case. Using our
theory, it should be possible to reveal the necessary com-
ponents to include in a model that accurately describes
these promising electrolytes.
B. High entropy electrolytes
Within the chemistries of LHCE's, it has been pro-
posed that by adding more types of solvents, without
changing the concentration of salt and the solvation en-
thalpy, the average cluster size can decreases while retain-
ing roughly the same number of anions in the coordina-
tion shell of Li [135]. This is thought to occur because of
the increased entropy of mixing, similar to high entropy
alloys, which is why these systems have been referred to
as high entropy electrolytes (HEE) [135]. These HEE
have been reported to have signicantly better transport
properties, without diminishing the stability of the elec-
trolyte [135].
The toy model we utilise to investigate this system
is shown in Appendix B. We nd that our theory does
not support the design principle of HEE. More types of
solvent, which interact identically with the cation, leave
the average cation-anion cluster size unaltered. In Ap-
pendix B, we have given some possible explanations as
to why this could be, but reserve making nal, physical
conclusions until a detailed comparison can be made be-
tween our theory and simulations of these electrolytes.
We believe it is essential to perform this comparison to
understand the origin of the electrolytes promising trans-
port properties [135].
In addition to Ref. 135, there are now further examples
of electrolytes which claim to be high entropy [136{138].
In Appendix B we further discuss these examples, al-
though we do not specically develop theories for these
cases. We also provide a general discussion of the ideas
of high entropy alloys and oxides [139] and what this
could mean for electrolytes, and point readers reviews
on the role of entropy in self-organised structures [140{
142], which will provide insight the role of entropy in con-
centrated electrolytes, and especially high entropy elec-10
trolytes.
C. Chelating Agents
Solvents which can bind to cations from multiple
points, i.e. multi-dentate ligands, have been proposed
to be benecial in reversing the negative transference
numbers of salt-in-ILs [58, 143, 144]. A limiting case of
such electrolytes is when the solvent completely encapsu-
lates the cation, preventing it from binding to any other
species, be it anions or other solvent molecules. The \de-
sign principle" of the addition of encapsulating chelating
agents is to break up the cation-anion associations and
prevent anions from binding strongly to the cations [145].
Here we shall develop an approach to include these multi-
dentate, encapsulating solvents, to see if this principle is
supported by our theory.
Our developed theory extension for this type of sol-
vent, shown in Appendix C, yields predictions which are
consistent with that of Ref. 145, i.e. dissociation of larger
clusters. Therefore, the design principle of adding chelat-
ing agents which encapsulate the cations is supported by
our simple theory. Further work should compare how the
cluster distribution is altered by the presence of these
chelating agents in detail.
D. Soft Solvents
While mixtures of carbonate solvents have been used
in commercial LIB electrolytes for a while, these elec-
trolytes do no perform optimally, and it is known that
the solvents are very strongly bound to Li+. Such sol-
vents have high binding energies and dielectric constants,
which ensures the solubility of salts such as LiPF 6, but
causes slow desolvation dynamics, amongst other issues.
To overcome this, and related issues, it has been sug-
gested to instead employ \soft solvents" which have a
fairly low binding energy, but still a modest dielectric
constant, in order to reduce the strength of the cation-
anion interaction [134]. With these soft solvents, highly
dissociating salts are required, but these mixtures have
highly promising transport, interfacial/interphasial prop-
erties and temperature operating ranges [134].
While we do not need to specically develop a toy
model for soft solvents, as it already falls within the the-
ory presented, we would like to highlight a few points.
As we have shown here, the association constants are
the physical parameters that describe the association
strength, which combines information about the associa-
tion energy and dielectric constant, as well as the entropy
of association [56]. By plotting where dierent LIB elec-
trolytes are on a graph of  + as a function of  +x, the
competition of anion and solvent associations for dier-
ent LIB electrolytes can be characterised. For example,
we expect soft solvent systems to have relatively small
+ and  +x, but commercial LIB electrolytes have alarge  +xand small  + . The magnitude of the as-
sociation constants are directly linked to the lifetime of
the associations, and therefore, the timescales of associ-
ation/disassociation [97, 101, 146{149].
V. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have developed a theory for the solva-
tion structure and ionic aggregation of non-aqueous elec-
trolytes. We have tested this theory against molecular
dynamics simulations of a \classical" non-aqueous elec-
trolyte, 1 M LiPF 6in mixtures of carbonates. Overall,
we found excellent agreement between our theory and the
classical molecular dynamics simulations, and our theory
also worked well in comparison to already published ex-
perimental results for the competition between EC and
PC in the coordination shell of Li+. Condent in the the-
ory, we investigated non-aqueous electrolytes of interest
in next generation of LIBs. Overall, it is hoped that this
theory will provide a framework for understanding the
solvation shell of electrolytes in a more systematic way,
and aid the design of next-generation chemistries.
While we have focused on the solvation structure of the
cations here, which is known to be crucial in understand-
ing the properties of LIB electrolytes, our theory can be
directly used to calculate physiochemical properties of
interest, which can quantify the connection between sol-
vation structure and properties of interest. For example,
we have developed a consistent treatment of ionic trans-
port based on vehicular motion of species, which could be
used to understand conductivity and transference num-
bers of dierent mixtures [56, 58]; we can calculate ac-
tivity coecients from our theory [57], which can pro-
vide indications of if the electrolyte is expected to form
a stable SEI; and we recently developed the theory to
predict the composition of electrolytes at charged inter-
faces [113, 115], where desolvation of cations could be a
result of the breakdown of the cluster distribution at an
interface. In our experience, the theory has qualitatively
worked for all of these applications, but quantitatively
it does best for transference numbers and activity co-
ecients, with conductivity and double layer properties
being more dicult to predict. We believe the value of
the theory is its physical transparency that allows a con-
ceptual understanding in these LIB electrolytes.
Looking forward, our theory could be developed to un-
derstand the kinetics of SEI formation [150{152] in more
detail with explicit account of the solvation shell, and
electron transfer reactions of solvated cations at inter-
faces [153, 154], where the reorganisation energy could
be linked to the free energy of forming those clusters.
Here we focused on non-aqueous electrolytes, and previ-
ously we have studied ionic liquids [56], water-in-salt elec-
trolytes [57] and salt-in-ionic liquids [58], but the theory
is quite general, and could be applied to a wide vari-
ety of electrolytes, from high concentration to low con-
centration (provided long-ranged electrostatics are intro-11
duced [55]), for various temperatures [56], and for vari-
ous types of solvent (aqueous and non-aqueous) and salt
compositions, provided Cayley tree clusters are formed.
The theory we present here is simple, but we believe
it acts as a good starting point for further work. One
of the main limiting assumptions of the theory is the
formation of Cayley trees, with only 2 species that can
form the backbone of a percolating network. In real-
ity, this assumption only holds for specic electrolytes,
typically only with chaotropic species. Fortunately, LIB
electrolytes mainly appear to fall within this category,
but certain high entropy electrolytes, or electrolytes with
only kosmotropic species break our assumptions. There-
fore, we believe it is important to further develop theo-
ries [123, 155, 156] and perform simulations beyond the
assumptions here [88, 90{93].

Appendix A: Localized high-concentration
electrolyte
Our toy model for localized high-concentrated elec-
trolyte (LHCE) rst xes a relative composition of highly
concentrated electrolyte (HCE) with cations, and anions
and solvent molecules which bind to the cations. All
of these components are then equally diluted. This ad-
ditional co-solvent which dilutes the HCE, making the
LHCE, is introduced as any other solvent in the the-
ory, but with an association constant of 0. Therefore,
no additional mass action or conservation of association
equations need to be introduced, and all that changes is
the new volume fractions of the cation, anion and sol-
vent which are given by d
i=i(1 d), wheredis the
volume fraction of the diluent and d
iis the new volume
fraction of each diluted species.
Let us rst look at the predictions from the \sticky
cation" approximation. For the anion and a single solvent
in the coordination shell of the cation, we have

In the above equations, the replacement of  ifor d
i
can be made. It is clear that the factor (1  d) which
multiplies all original volume fractions of species com-
pletely cancels from the expressions. Therefore, for a
xed ~, within the sticky cation approximation, there
is no eect from diluent on the association probabilities,
and the coordination shell of the cation remains identical
to the HCE it is derived from.
To further understand LHCE, let us investigate a mass
action law where 1 >P
i0p+i0, i.e. not the sticky cation
approximation. If the association probabilities are to re-
main unchanged by the addition of the diluent, then  i i
must remain unchanged. The value of   ishould, how-
ever, decrease with increasing volume fraction of diluent.
Therefore, there must be a corresponding increase in  i
to compensate, to keep  i iconstant. When taking the
ratio of the association constants in the sticky cation ap-
proximation this increase in the  i's was hidden.
It is known that the coordination structure of the
cation does change [28], which is perhaps not surprising,
as in reality ~ (or the  i's) will not correspondingly in-
crease. It is thought that the diluent can interact with the
solvent molecules as well as change the dielectric constant
of the mixture resulting in an increase of anion molecules
in the cation coordination shell [28].
One can account for short-ranged interactions between
the solvent and diluent through a regular solution inter-
action, similar to how we treated the IL cations in salt-in-
ILs [58]. This will tend to remove the solvent molecules
from the cations solvation shell, which should exponen-
tially depend on the volume fraction of the diluent. By
computing the concentration dependence of the associa-
tion constant on the diluent volume fraction, it should
be clear exactly how the interaction appears.
On the other hand, the diluent changes the dielectric
constant of the mixture and the concentration of asso-
ciating species which, presumably, alters the association
constants in a dierent way. Predicting the exact changes
which will happen is dicult, but by performing simu-
lations of specic LHCE and extracting the association
probabilities and constants, one can further understand
the simulations from the developed theory.12
Appendix B: High entropy electrolytes
Our toy model for the high entropy electrolytes (HEE)
of Ref. 135 assumes a xed volume fraction of salt, with
the cation-anion association constant xed. The total
volume fraction of solvent also remains constant, but its
composition can be divided up between multiple dier-
ent solvents. For now, let us assume these solvents can
solvate the cation, and there is no diluent present. These
solvents are essentially only dierent in the sense that
they are labelled dierently, as we take their volumes
(1=2;2=2;1) and association constants with the
cations to be identical ( 1=  2;2=  2;1), where the
index 1 is used for the single solvent, and 2 ;1 and 2;2
is used to denote the solvents in the system with two
solvents. Therefore, the only dierence between a sys-
tem with 1 solvent (with 1) and another with 2 solvents
(with1=2;1+2;2) is the entropy of the systems. We
include the entropy of mixing, congurational entropy
and conformational entropy of clusters, as shown in the
Theory Section of the main text.
Furthermore, let us rst focus on a limiting case where
the solvent cation interactions are extremely strong,
i1, with the cation-anion association constant much
smaller  i , and when there are more cation asso-
ciation sites than solvent association sites, i.e. c+f+>P
ici. In such a case, the probability of solvent associat-
ing to cation is, of course, pi+= 1. From the conservation
of associations, the cation association probabilities to the
solvents are p+i= i= +. For the single solvent system
we havep+1= 1= +, and for the two solvent system
we havep+2;2= 2;2= +andp+2;1= 2;1= +. Clearly,
then, we nd that the total probability of a cation be-
ing associated to a solvent molecule remains the same
between 1 and 2 types of solvent molecules, with the
relationship p+1=p+2;1+p+2;2holding. In fact, as
we found from numerically solving the mass action laws,
this relationship holds irrespective of the employed asso-
ciation constants (provided the solvent-cation association
constants are the same) and volume fractions.
With the previously derived results for p+i, it is clear
that the cation-anion mass action law, as generally given
by
   =p+ p +
(1 p+  P
ip+i) (1 p +); (A1)
remains unchanged by the presence of more types of sol-
vents which interact with the cation identically. Un-
surprisingly, then, the cation-anion probabilities remain
the same, independent of the number of \dierent" sol-
vents in the system. As the cations and anions form
the back-bone of the \alternating ionic co-polymer" of
Cayley-tree-like clusters, if their probabilities of associ-
ation do not change, then the cation-anion cluster dis-
tribution, after summing out the solvent indexes, does
not change. Moreover, the percolation threshold is deter-
mined by (f+ 1)(f  1) =p+ p +for Cayley tree clus-
ters, which also cannot change from adding more typesof \dierent" solvents.
We will explicitly show how the cluster distribution is
not eected by the number of dierent solvents, again
by considering the case of 1 solvent and 2 solvents. For
clarity of notation, we take  =  1=  2;2=  2;1. The
cluster distribution for 1 solvent is generally given by
clms=Wlms
 ( l )l( m )m( s)s: (A2)
Let us assume that there is some combination of land
msuch that there are only ncation association sites re-
maining. Therefore, we arrive at
cns
cn=n!
s!(n s)!( s)s; (A3)
wherecnis used as a short-hand for the cluster distri-
bution of this cation-anion combination with ncation
association sites remaining.
Similarly, the cluster distribution for two solvents is
clmpq =Wlmpq
 ( l )l( m )m( p)p( q)q;(A4)
and again considering ncation association sites being
free, we have
cnpq
cn=n!
p!q!(n p q)!( p)p( q)q: (A5)
Given the probabilities pi+are not altered, and that the
volume fraction of the solvent remains constant, it is clear
that the following relationship holds for any s
cns=s=p+qX
pqcnpq: (A6)
This is simply a binomial distribution of the two solvents
in place of the single solvent, which does not alter how
much solvent is associated to the clusters. While we have
shown this for only two solvent here, it is expected that
it generalises to any number of solvents, with there being
a multinomial instead of a binomial distribution.
Another example of a HEE could be from keeping the
solvating solvents the same, but increasing the number of
diluent solvents. From the previous section on LHCE, as
these diluents do not associate to the cation ( = 0), if
they interact with the solvnets identically (say through
the same regular solution term ), and have the same
dielectric constant, it is clear that more diluents should
not alter the cation-anion association probabilities or the
cation-solvent probabilities.
We can conclude, then, that the design principle of
HEE is not supported by our theory. We nd that, for
solvents which interact with the cation (and other sol-
vents) identically, more types of solvents does not alter
the cation-anion cluster distribution or percolation point,
provided the cation-anion association constant is xed.13
These electrolytes are, however, advantageous for some
reason, as their transport properties clearly show [135].
There could be two possible reasons why our theory does
not support the assumed principle of HEE. One possi-
bility is that the fundamental assumptions of our the-
ory (Cayley tree clusters, neglecting long-ranged electro-
statics, the free energy of formation of a cluster, mono-
dentate solvent molecules, etc.) are awed in some way
and cannot be applied to HEE. The other possibility
is that, while the solvents interact with the cation in
a similar way, they are never exactly the same, and the
changes to the properties of the electrolyte occur because
of the slight dierences in their association constants (or
functionalities, volumes, etc.), instead of the proposed in-
crease in the entropy of mixing. Only by a detailed com-
parison between the proposed toy model and atomistic
simulations can the origin of the discrepancy be unveiled.
In Appendix D, a method for systematically performing
such comparisons of solvation and aggregation behaviour
is outlined.
In addition to Ref. 135, there are now further exam-
ples of \high entropy electrolytes". In Ref. 138, Yang et
al.combined LiCl and ZnCl 2in water at various com-
positions, and found a 2:1 ratio with 9 water molecules
per formula unit yielded an optimal transport and sta-
bility compromise, performing signicantly better than
water-in-salt [157]. This occurs because the Li+coor-
dination shell is mostly water, with Zn2+being consis-
tently coordinated by 4Cl anions. The authors argued
this electrolyte was distinct from \water-in-bi-salt", be-
cause of the observed properties being distinct from pre-
vious water-in-bi-salt systems [158, 159]. We, however,
disagree with this conclusion and believe the dierence
in the behaviour occurs from dierences of interactions
of the cations with water and chloride [138]. In previous
water-in-bi-salt systems [158], there was typically only
one strongly coordinating cation, with the other being a
weakly interacting ionic liquid cation. This meant the
water and anion are in competition for the coordination
sites of the cation. In Ref. 138, however, two strongly
coordinating cations are used, and their preferential sol-
vation behaviour and 2:1 ratio assists Li+being solvated
by water and Zn2+by Cl . We believe this system can be
modelled by a combined and modied version of our the-
ories for salt-in-ionic liquids [58] and water-in-salt elec-
trolytes [57].
In Ref. 137, the authors investigated the liquid-solid
phase behaviour of mixtures of Li+salts with numerous
anions. Overall, it is found when 5 anions are present,
there is a suppression of precipitation. It is claimed this
occurs because the larger number of dierent anions in
the coordination shell of Li+. While we cannot explic-
itly develop a theory for this example, as there are many
species with fi>1, this conclusion would very naturally
follow from our theory if this limitation was overcome,
provided Li+interacts with all anions with a similar free
energy of association. Moreover, linking the suppression
of precipitation from disordered coordination environ-ments is conceptually similar to engineering the phase
behaviour in high entropy alloys/oxides. We believe in
this electrolyte kosmotropic, ordered clusters of 2 species
should be suppressed is favour of chaotropic, branched
aggregates with many dierent species. In addition, it
was also found transport properties were improved, but
no link was suggested to the exact coordination envi-
ronment, other than it being disordered. Overall, we
believe extensions of our theory will support the conclu-
sions made for this electrolyte being high entropy, but
further analysis of the simulation results will be required
to completely understand this promising system.
In high entropy alloys and high entropy oxides, the
crucial requirements are that a large number of simi-
lar components exist, often at least 5, and that the dif-
ference in how these species interact with other species
is similar, which motivates neglecting interaction terms
and only retaining the entropy of mixing [139]. We be-
lieve these two requirements, at least 5 components
of cations/anions/solvents/diluents and these 5 com-
ponents interacting similarly with the other components,
are the minimum requirements for an electrolyte to be
high entropy. In addition, in LIB electrolytes, presum-
ably only one active cation is desired, which means only
multiple anions/solvents/diluents are potentially more
promising avenues. In Ref. 135 they showed that the sol-
vents had a similar solvation enthalpy, but only 3 dier-
ent coordinating solvents were considered, which might
not conceptually be thought of as high entropy (at least
according to high entropy alloys/oxides [139], but in elec-
trolytes the number of components that make it high
entropy could be smaller than that of alloys/oxides). In
Ref. 138 again only two cations were considered, and they
interacted with water and the chloride ions very dier-
ently, which means both conditions are not satised. In
Ref. 137, 5 dierent anions were investigated, but it was
not explicitly shown that they have a similar interac-
tion strength with the other components, although their
reported clusters suggest they could be similar. Thus
Ref. 137 should satisfy both of the requirements for a
high entropy electrolyte.
It is also crucial to note that the role of entropy in self-
assembling systems is very dierent to, and signicantly
more complicated than, high entropy alloys/oxides. In
high entropy alloys/oxides there is essentially only the
entropy of mixing. In the theory presented here, which
builds on previous works on self-assembled systems, there
is the entropy of mixing all clusters, but also the combina-
torial and congurational entropy of the clusters. For free
species the combinatorial entropy is 0, but when there
are large species with many ways of arranging them, the
entropy substantially increases. Therefore, entropy ac-
tually drives the formation of large clusters. We wish to
point the reader to Refs. 140{142 for further discussion of
these concepts in self-assembled systems, as these ideas
will be useful to understand high entropy electrolytes.14
Appendix C: Chelating Agents
In this section, we outline modications to the theory
that allow chelating agents to be included. This is the
starting point for the inclusion of solvent molecules which
are multi-dentate, but that do not completely encapsu-
late a cation. We do not solve this problem in its full
complexity, but simply outline the principles, leaving an
in-depth analysis for future work.
The chemical equilibrium between free species and the
higher ranking clusters determines the cluster distribu-
tion, and the free cation concentration is one of the key
variables in this balance. If there are anions/solvents and
another solvent which can encapsulate the cation, the free
cation concentration is given by the probability of not be-
ing bound to the anions/solvents and the encapsulating
solvent, as seen through
100=+pfpc; (A1)
where the probability of not being bound to any anions
or singly solvating molecules given by
pf= (1 X
ip+i)f+; (A2)
and the probability of not being encapsulated by one of
the chelating agents is given by
pc= 1 p+c: (A3)
Crucially, the cation behaves as if it has a functionality
of 1 when binding to the encapsulating solvent molecule.
The free cation concentration can be recast into a more
familiar form
100=c
+pc; (A4)
where there is a renormalised volume fraction of cations
which are not bound to anions/solvent
c
+=+(1 X
ip+i)f+: (A5)
Equivalently, the free cation volume fraction can be writ-
ten as
100=i
+pf; (A6)
with a renormalised cation volume fraction without any
associations to the encapsulating solvent
i
+=+(1 p+c): (A7)
The important point to note is that the renormalised
volume fractions of cations can be treated as unknowns
which need to be found.
From these observations, a set of modied mass action
laws and conservation of associations can be stated. Forthe encapsulating solvent, we have for the mass action
law
c c=p+cpc+
(1 p+c)(1 pc+); (A8)
and for the conservation of associations
 c= c
+p+c= cpc+; (A9)
where c
+=c
+=+=+(1 P
ip+i)f+=+, withi6=c.
The mass action laws for the cation associations to the
anions/solvents are similar to the case before
i c
i=p+ipi+
(1 P
ip+i)(1 pi+); (A10)
and the conservation of associations
 c
i= i
+p+i= ipi+; (A11)
where i
+=i
+pi+=+=+(1 p+c)=+.
Now, Eqs. (A8)-(A11) need to be solved to obtain the
association probabilities, and therefore, the cluster dis-
tribution. Either this can be done numerically all to-
gether. Alternatively, one can solve Eqs. (A8) and (A9)
together to obtain the association probabilities p+c=c+as
a function of c
+, and Eqs. (A10) and (A11) to obtain as-
sociation probabilities p+i=i+as a function of i
+. These
resulting probability equations, which are functions of
c
+andi
+, need to be self-consistently solved to nd
the consistent values of the association probabilities.
Instead of solving the set of equations in its full com-
plexity, we only study a single limiting case. We take
ci. Therefore, practically all of the chelating
agents are bound to the cations. This means pc+= 1
andp+c=c=+<1 from the conservation of asso-
ciations. Therefore, i
+=+ c, which is a known
quantity, and can be used in Eqs. (A10) and (A11) to
obtain association probabilities p+i=i+.
Let us again study the limit of the sticky cation ap-
proximation, given by Eqs. (A2) and (A3), but where
one of the solvents is replaced by anions. Again, let
us start from a HCE (1 = ++ +x) and add the
chelating agent, and see how the association probabilities
change between these two systems. The chelating agent
reduces the overall volume fraction of all other species,
but from LHCE we know that this does not alter the as-
sociation probabilities, provided ~ is constant. Relative
to the HCE without the chelating agent, the new vol-
ume fraction of anions is given by 0
 = (1 c) and
the new volume fraction of solvent by 0
x=x(1 c),
while the new volume fraction of cations is give by
0
+=+(1 c) c, assuming all the chelating agent
binds to the cation.
We nd that (assuming equal volumes and numbers
for everything += =xandc+=c =cx,
f+= 4,f = 3, which is typical) for solvent-cation
associations favoured over the anion-cation associations,
~ =  =x<1, the addition of chelating agent causes15
a reduction in both p+ andp +, which clearly reduces
p+ p +and the extent of large clusters. There is an in-
crease inp+xto compensate for the decreased p+ (be-
cause of the sticky cation approximation), and a decrease
inpx+from the conservation of associations. Therefore,
the chelating agent breaks up the aggregates. On the
other hand, for ~ =  =x>1, the addition of the
chelating agents increases p+ but decreases p +, and
results in both p+xandpx+decreasing. The increase in
p+ is small in comparison to the decrease in p +, which
meansp+ p +decreases and breaks up larger clusters in
favour of smaller ones.
Therefore, it appears that it is always appears to be
advantageous to introduce a chelating agent to break
up large clusters [143, 144], and the design principle of
adding these molecules is supported by our theory [145].
Appendix D: Consistent Reporting of Associations
Molecular dynamics simulations are often the method
of choice for understand non-aqueous electrolytes, but
the quantities which are reported from such simulations
often dier, making it dicult to compare two studies.
For example, sometimes the percentages of 0 ;1;2;3;:::
anions coordinated to the cation is shown, or the percent-
age of free/bound solvent, pictures of percolating aggre-
gates, or the numbers/frequency of certain coordination
environments are reported. This inconsistency in report-
ing the associations makes it dicult to systematically
compare studies, and often not enough information is
provided to fully characterise the associations. Here we
outline a convention for reporting associations, as the de-
veloped theory provides a framework to make reporting
such results more systematic.
As is usually done in some form already, the ensem-
ble average coordination number of species jassociated
to speciesi,Nij, should be stated (note the index iwas
dropped in the main text, as only the coordination shell
of cations was considered). This information can be used
to calculate/infer the functionality of each species fi, as
the sum of the average coordination numbers should be
a maximum of fi(within some tolerance). The Nijcan
also be used to calculate the association probabilities us-
ing thefi's throughpij=Nij=fi, or from the conserva-
tion of associations and the volume fractions. While this
is a natural starting point, only reporting the directly
associated species does not always uniquely characterise
all the clusters, and it is necessary to calculate further
quantities.
A requirement of our theory is that only 2 species can
have functionalities larger than 1, with all other species
only being allowed functionalities of 1. This requirement
is a reection of the fact that if there are 3 species with
functionalities larger than 1, the Cayley tree clusters are
no longer uniquely dened by their rank. So far we haveonly worked with electrolytes within this requirement,
but it is clear that the promising properties of high en-
tropy electrolytes will mean studying compositions out-
side of this requirement.
For the case of a maximum of 2 species with a function-
ality larger than 1, if the electrolyte (almost) exclusively
forms Cayley tree clusters, the clusters are uniquely de-
ned by their rank and the cluster distribution clmsq:::
can be reported. To display the cluster distribution of
this case, 2D maps of the clm=P
sq:::clmsq::: should be
displayed, where landmare the species which can perco-
late (fi>1), andsq:::havefi= 1. In addition, as single
cation species are presumably of most interest (as ag-
gregates with more than 1 cation are typically large and
immobile), 2D concentration plots over dierent combi-
nations of anion/solvents or solvent/solvent would clearly
show these clusters of most interest. If the inequality
pijpji<(fj 1)(fi 1) is held, the system is in the
pre-gel regime. If pijpji>(fj 1)(fi 1), the system
is in the post-gel regime, and in addition to the cluster
distribution being specied, the fraction of each species
in the gel must also be stated.
Crucially, to test if Cayley tree clusters are formed, the
cluster bond density can be calculated through the num-
ber of associations in a cluster divided by the number of
species in that cluster. For Cayley trees, the cluster bond
density is 1 1=N, whereNis the number of species in
the cluster. For very large clusters, the cluster bond den-
sity of Cayley trees saturates at 1. If the cluster bond
density (substantially) exceeds 1  1=N, then there are
(signicant) intra-cluster loops, indicating more ordered
aggregates than Cayley trees are formed. If this is the
case, the cluster distribution clmsq::: no longer uniquely
denes the system, and for each cluster of rank lmsq:::
there exists another distribution on how this cluster is
connected (with dierent numbers of associations to dif-
ferent species), which must be specied to uniquely dene
the system. While it is unclear exactly how these results
should be reported from our theory, we believe that re-
porting results just based on the rank of the cluster still
provides valuable information, following the previously
suggested plots, and would be a good starting point to
quantifying the clusters.
If there are more than 2 species with functionalities
larger than 2, even if Cayley tree clusters are formed, the
rank of the cluster does not uniquely dene the cluster.
Therefore, how the clusters are connected must always be
reported for this case. It is still important to calculate the
cluster bond density, as this information provides insight
into how ordered clusters are. Again, as it is unclear
from the theory exactly how to present the results of
these clusters, we suggest that the convention of 2 species
withfi>1 is followed, but where all of the relevant 2-
species combinations is displayed on a 2D plot. Similarly,
the volume fractions of each species in the gel should be
reported, if present, although the percolation condition
for this case is not known.16
