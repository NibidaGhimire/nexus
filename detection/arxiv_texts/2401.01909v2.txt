Abstract
This paper examines the relevance of the
Godot Engine in the indie game industry.
The Godot Engine is a relatively new game
engine from 2014 and competes with lead-
ing market players. To get to the bottom
of its relevance, two major online sales plat-
forms and the game engines that are com-
monly used, Steam and itch.io, are exam-
ined. Mainly, these findings are compared
with reference data from 2018. It turns out
that the Godot engine has gained massive
relevance in 2020 and now seems to be one of
the leading players in the indie game indus-
try. The exact causes are difficult to deter-
mine. However, this paper provides many
clues for further research in this area.
1 Introduction
In the realm of video game development,
the methodology for creating games has
evolved significantly over time. As early as
the 1980s, several companies began using
their own in-house engines. For instance,
in the case of Super Mario Bros (1985),
Nintendo used a fast scrolling game engine
that was originally developed for Excitebike
(1984) [1]. The concept of licensing game
engines to other companies as a standalone
product has been around since the mid-90’s.
At that time, games like Doom (1993) were
developed using the id Tech game engine
[2]. This engine was specifically designed
for 3D shooters, although this iteration wasnot yet a fully-fledged 3D game engine.
Over the years, an increasing number of
game engines were developed to speed up
the development of video games.
It should be mentioned that the definition
of a game engine differs in literature. In
this paper, game engines are seen as frame-
works that accelerate the development pro-
cess and provide at least support for 2D or
3D rendering. It is crucial to recognize that
not only does the definition differ signifi-
cantly, but so does the use case of a game
engine. A prime example is the id Tech en-
gine, which was developed explicitly for a
particular genre of video games. There are
also game engines like Unity, which could
be called a general purpose game engine.
Therefore, a comparison between game en-
gines is not easy. Since they always serve
a specific purpose, there is no game engine
that stands above all others. This paper
takes a closer look at the purpose of video
game development in the indie game indus-
try, with a particular focus on the Godot
Engine. The decision to investigate this spe-
cific game engine is driven by the insights
derived from a few datasets, which will be
expounded upon later in this paper.
2 Godot Engine
The Godot Engine was released as open
source under the MIT license on GitHub on
1arXiv:2401.01909v2  [cs.OH]  10 Jan 2024February 10 in 20141[3]. The first stable
release was published in December 2014 [4].
This makes it relatively new in comparison
to popular game engines like Unity and
Unreal Engine, which were released in 2005
and 1998, respectively [5, 6]. Considering
the different release dates, it should be clear
that due to the young age of the Godot
Engine the ecosystem that formed around
this technology is still small in comparison
to older engines.
The Godot Engine supports cross-platform
exports and facilitates the development
of 2D and 3D games [7]. Video games
can be exported for PC, mobile devices or
web platforms. These games are written
with a programming language specially
developed for the Godot Engine called
GDScript. GDScript is a dynamically
typed programming language which is
syntactically similar to Python. However,
the Godot Engine also officially supports
C#and includes GDNative, a technology
for creating bindings to other languages
[8]. These officially include C and C ++.
Unofficially support for languages such as
D, Kotlin, Nim, Python and Rust have
been developed by the community.
It’s noteworthy that the Godot Engine ap-
pears to attract not only smaller companies
but also larger players like Microsoft, Epic
Games and Meta’s Reality Labs. Microsoft
donated $24,000 to the Godot team in 2017
for implementing C #as a programming
language [9]. In 2020, the Godot Engine
received the Epic MegaGrant of $250,000,
which is distributed by Epic Games to
projects that expand the open source 3D
graphics ecosystem [10]. This is noteworthy
as Epic Games develops the Unreal Engine,
suggesting a potential interest in support-
ing other game engines for mutual benefit.
The adoption of an MIT license, as in the
case of Godot Engine, may facilitate the

negative implications for intellectual prop-
erty. In December 2020 and 2021 Godot
Engine received donations from Meta’s
Reality Labs [11, 12]. The funds will be
used specifically for development in the
field of extended reality (XR). There is no
public information available regarding the
exact amount of the donation. This was
confirmed in a Reddit comment by project
manager R´ emi Verschelde (akien-mga)
[13]. R´ emi also mentioned that the team
actively approaches companies rather than
the other way around.
3 Methodology
In the last section it became evident that
the Godot Engine has managed to capture
the attention of larger companies, suggest-
ing a degree of relevance in the video game
industry. However, this does not directly
address the central question of how relevant
the Godot Engine is for indie game devel-
opers. To effectively answer this question,
we must first establish a clear definition
of indie game development. Just as the
definition of a game engine is elusive, so is
the definition of indie game development.
The definition used here is from O’Donnell,
who states that indie games focus on a few
goals and can be developed on a smaller
scale in terms of manpower [14]. An indie
game development team operates without
financial backing from a larger company,
distinguishing it from AAA titles developed
with substantial budgets and large teams.
To investigate the relevance of the Godot
Engine for indie game developers, a com-
prehensive literature review was conducted.
It is important to note that this research
was not limited to scholarly articles but also
included gray literature. This is because
the Godot Engine is a relatively new game
engine, and there is a lack of scholarly
articles on the topic. The gray literature
used in this paper was carefully selected to
ensure reliable and trustworthy information.
2For this paper, the digital sales platforms
Steam and itch.io were selected for inves-
tigation. Firstly, it aligns with a study
conducted by Toftedahl and Engstr¨ om that
provides comparative data from 2018 [15].
Secondly, reference is made to a survey
named “State of the Game Industry” from
2023 encompassing 2,300 video game devel-
opers [16]. Notably, the focus in this paper
lies on PC and not on console or mobile
games. This is because the mentioned
survey from 2023 showed that 65% of the
respondents are actively developing for
PC and 57% plan to do so in the next
project as well. In 2019, a survey involv-
ing nearly 4,000 video game developers
highlighted that, aside from publisher-
owned and individual websites, most games
are primarily sold on Steam and itch.io [17].
Identifying the game engine used in games
available on Steam presents a significant
challenge due to a lack of detailed infor-
mation. In the paper by Toftedahl and
Engstr¨ om mentioned above, a script was
used that matches games with articles on
Wikipedia and subsequently assigns game
engines. However, this procedure presents
challenges and gaps in the data sets. This is
because not all games provide information
about the underlying game engine.
Alternatively, another method involves
recognizing the game engines used by ana-
lyzing filenames through pattern matching.
The website SteamDB employs this method
to deduce the game engines utilized in
development [18]. While this approach
provides valuable insights, it is not without
its limitations, including the potential for
gaps or false positives due to ambiguous
filenames. In this paper, the datasets
from SteamDB are used because matching
filenames to game engines yield more
accurate results than matching the data
to Wikipedia articles. In addition, the
different versions of the id Tech engine were
combined as one.Analyzing the data from itch.io proves
to be more straightforward because the
website provides a list of game engines
used in development with the number of
games for each engine. This structured pre-
sentation of data facilitates ease of access
and analysis. This approach aligns with
the methodology employed by Toftedahl
and Engstr¨ om in their research. However,
it is important to acknowledge that this
method captures a static snapshot of the
data at a given point in time. To address
this limitation a script was developed that
extracts data from itch.io’s RSS feed in
XML format, specifically recording the
publication date of each game [19]. This
additional temporal dimension allows for
the creation of a time series, enabling
a more in-depth analysis of used game
engines over time.
4 Results
When examining the presence of various
game engines on Steam for 2018, 2022, and
2023, it is important to see the significance
of these results in the context of indie
game development. The following Table 1
presents the percentages of game engines
on Steam for these years.

Table 1: Percentage of total games iden-
tified on Steam (data collected 2022-09-30
and 2023-10-21)
3Game engines that have experienced an
increase in their percentage of total games
developed in comparison to the previous
year(s) are highlighted in green, indicating
a positive trend, while those that have seen
a decrease are highlighted in red, suggest-
ing a decline in their usage over the same
period. The data from 2018 was collected
using the Wikipedia method, while the data
from 2022 and 2023 was collected using the
pattern matching method. Color-coding in
Table 1 is missing for the column for 2022.
This is due to the differing data collection
methods used in 2018. It is difficult to say
whether the newer method can attribute
more game engines or simply more games
were created using a particular game
engine. To illustrate, consider Unity, which
has 35.62% more share of all identified
games from 2018 to 2022. Additionally,
it is worth noting that among the game
engines analyzed, only the Unreal Engine
has consistently exhibited growth over the
various years. This trend holds true when
considering both the complete dataset,
which includes 2018 data, and the dataset
from 2022 and 2023 alone. The Godot
Engine is not listed in Table 1 because the
paper from Toftedahl and Engstr¨ om did
not include it in their analysis. Despite
this omission, the data remains valuable
in shedding light on changing market
dynamics.
Between 2022 and 2023, it is noteworthy
that other game engines have also gained
increased popularity, indicating shifts in
the competitive landscape. At the time of
the collected data in 2022, 1.15% of games
were created with the Godot Engine. How-
ever, in 2023, this percentage increased to
1.44%. Compared to other game engines on
SteamDB, the Godot Engine ranks 6th out
of 65 recognized game engines. In addition
to that it is important to understand that
the percentages from Table 1 represent
lower bounds. Particularly in the case of
the Godot engine, there could be a lot
more games. This is due to the fact thatthe Godot Engine allows for the export of
executables without a recognizable filename
signature, making them unidentifiable by
the SteamDB algorithm. Consequently,
only a subset of games with specific file-
name patterns can be matched.

Date# of apps
Figure 1: Number of released Apps on
Steam per month
Examining the monthly app releases de-
picted in Figure 1, a clear trend emerges: in
2020, there was a significant increase in the
number of released games. This increase in
game releases prompts further investigation
to understand the underlying reasons. Prior
to conducting a more in-depth analysis of
the underlying reasons, we first draw a
parallel by comparing the data from itch.io.
In contrast to Steam, the digital sales plat-
form itch.io predominantly showcases indie
games, aligning with the specific focus of
this paper. Unlike Steam, itch.io possesses
an official statistics website that provides
information on game engines [20]. However,
it’s essential to acknowledge that this data
might be incomplete due to its reliance
on self-reporting. Therefore, there may be
gaps or inaccuracies in the information, a
limitation inherent to self-reported data.

Table 2: Percentage of total games iden-
tified on itch.io (data collected 2022-09-30
and 2023-10-21)
Similar to Steam, the data from itch.io can
be compared to the 2018 reference paper
using the most current data available from
2022 and 2023. The consistent data collec-
tion method allows for direct comparisons,
as illustrated in Table 2. Upon comparing
the data presented in Table 1 and Table 2,
Unity stands out as a prevalent game
engine. In both 2022 and 2023, Unity
consistently constitutes over half of all
games on Steam and nearly half on itch.io.
This dominance is particularly striking
when considering the second-ranking game
engines, which represent approximately
16% of games on Steam and roughly 14%
on itch.io in 2023. A similar trend can be
observed for 2022.
It can also be seen that only three game
engines have consistently gained popularity
on itch.io. These three game engines are
Construct, Unreal and the Godot Engine.
Construct is a game engine primarily aimed
at non-programmers. With the help of
visual programming, it is intended to make
it easier for novice programmers to get
started. The notable increase in its per-
centage of games may be attributed to the
appeal of game development to a broader
audience with limited coding expertise.
However, this is only an assumption that
needs to be investigated further.Looking at Table 2, it becomes evident that
the Godot Engine has experienced remark-
able growth in popularity on itch.io. To
delve deeper into this trend, the previously
mentioned script was used to compile games
from itch.io along with their release dates.
It should be mentioned that not all games
could be fetched with this script. Despite
the missing data sets of up to about 10%
of the games, it is still possible to create
a trend plot for the game engines listed in
Table 2.

This graph is shown in Figure 2. Notably,
Unity, due to its large number of projects,
has been excluded from the graph to ensure
better visibility and clarity for the other
game engines. It is evident that the Godot
Engine has gained a significant surge in
popularity in 2020, surpassing both Bitsy
and Twine. This analysis has its limita-
tions, as it relies on the quantity of games
published. Quality and quantity of games
by individual publishers were not consid-
ered. Determining the exact percentage
of indie game studios is challenging as not
every publisher was individually analyzed.

Table 3: Used game engines by GMTK
Game Jam participants over the years [21]
An interesting distinction on itch.io, which
is not as prominent on Steam, is the preva-
lence of games created during game jams,
which are defined as follows:
A game jam is an accelerated
opportunistic game creation
event where a game is created
in a relatively short timeframe
exploring given design con-
straint(s) and end results are
shared publically [22].
With around 18,000 - 23,000 participants
and around 6,000 - 7,000 submissions,
GMTK Game Jam is the largest past
game jam event on itch.io [23, 24, 25].
Table 3 shows the game engines used
by participants in the events from 2020
to 2023. This table is clearly showing
that the Godot Engine is the only game
engine from the table to outperform the us-
age of the previous year three years in a row.
To explore more about the Godot Engine,
the Godot Community Poll from 2022 and
2023 was examined [26, 27]. In 2022, there
were 5,315 responses to the survey, while in
2023 the number increased to 7,671. These
surveys contain answers to a variety of
questions. Regarding previous experiences
with other game engines, respondents in
the 2022 survey mentioned Unity, other
third-party engines, and GameMaker.
In the 2023 survey, the trends remained
consistent. The surveys show that most
people heard about the Godot Engine
for the first time between 2018 and 2020.
However, most did not start developmentwith the engine until the following years
2019 to 2022. The surveys also clearly show
that the game engine is mainly used for 2D
game development.
The survey from 2022 sheds light on further
facts that are relevant to indie game devel-
opment. A substantial 84% of participants
stated that they use the Godot Engine as
a hobby, while 9% identified themselves as
full-time indie game developers. According
to the definition outlined in this paper,
hobby developers fall under the category
of indie game developers, as they share
common characteristics such as focusing
on specific goals, lacking financial support
from larger companies, and working in
small teams. This is further supported
by the finding that 97.9% work on their
project alone or in a team of up to five
people. Furthermore, the survey reveals
that 83.7% of respondents do not earn any
income from their games, emphasizing their
indie status. Additionally, the two most
prevalent digital sales platforms among
respondents are itch.io (7.1%) and Steam
(6%).
5 Discussion
When examining various data sets, it
becomes clear that the popularity of the
Godot Engine has increased. Starting with
the digital sales platform Steam, it is note-
worthy that the Godot Engine ranks 6th
out of 65, which indicates its importance
even at lower bounds, which arise due to
data collection. For a more meaningful
discussion, Unity and Unreal Engine will
also be included in this section. According
to Table 1 Unity lost a few percent from
2022 to 2023 while Unreal Engine gained
a few percent. A possible reason for this
could be that AAA titles are also published
on Steam and Unreal Engine is known to
be used for developing such games [28].
On the other hand, this argument explains
why growth on a platform like itch.io for
6Unreal Engine is rather slow compared
to the Godot Engine. While the Unreal
Engine prominently appears as the second
most used game engine on Steam, its
presence on itch.io has seen only marginal
growth of roughly 0.2% over the past four
to five years. Furthermore, Table 2 shows
that during the same period of time, the
Godot Engine has gained a share of roughly
5%. This is particularly interesting as it
suggests that the Unreal Engine has limited
relevance among indie developers, while
the Godot Engine has become increasingly
relevant in the indie game sector over time.
This observation is further supported by
the fact that the Godot Engine ranks third
on itch.io.
Although Unity is the biggest player in the
indie games sector, Table 2 clearly shows
that other game engines are gaining popu-
larity for indie game development. Another
game engine under competitive pressure is
GameMaker, which has lost roughly 4% of
its share over the years. This observation
can also be reproduced in the context
of game jams, where Unity is gradually
being displaced by other competitors, while
GameMaker has been rapidly losing ground
in recent years. In contrast, the Godot
Engine has seen a significant increase in
popularity in game jams, where it has
become the second most used game engine
in the GMTK Game Jam. It is important
to consider that the overall popularity of
a game engine could lead to its increased
utilization in game jams. Otherwise, it
should also be noted that some games
published in the GMTK Game Jam end
up on itch.io and in this way also increase
the number of games developed with
the Godot Engine. Further insight would
require a precise analysis of this interaction.
Unity and GameMaker will persist as
references in the Godot Engine Community
Polls, as they are mentioned in relation
to participants who have experience with
these game engines. Giving the decliningshares of Unity and GameMaker, it is
possible to assume that certain developers
may have switched entirely to the Godot
Engine. There could be many reasons
for this. On one hand, the license of the
Godot Engine offers great freedom and
on the other hand, certain features could
be favored. However, in order to draw a
direct comparison, a deeper analysis would
also have to be carried out. It should
also be noted that not every game engine
can be compared with every other, as
mentioned at the beginning. Each game
engine has its own purpose and therefore
a comparison is not easy. If a comparison
is nevertheless desired, one possible useful
comparison would be between Unity and
the Godot Engine, as both can be classified
as general-purpose game engines that cover
a wide range of game genres.
The results of this study make it clear that
the Godot Engine definitely has relevance
in the indie game industry. In all three
data sets analyzed (Steam, itch.io and
GMTK Game Jams), the Godot Engine
ranks better than most game engines. In
addition, it can also be said that various
larger companies that have shown an inter-
est in the Godot Engine through financial
support indicating its relevance in the
industry. The only question that remains
is why this is the case. Both Figure 1 and
Figure 2 clearly show 2020 as a successful
year for the Godot Engine. If you combine
this finding with the answers from the
Godot Community Poll, you can see that
people had already heard of the game
engine before 2020, but only developed
with it later. It is also quite possible that
events before 2020 were decisive for the
rapidly growing popularity in the indie
game industry. However, this data reveals
little about the reasons for this rise. Even
after extensive research, it is difficult to
pinpoint the exact reason for the growth.
This is probably due to the fact that many
factors are responsible for this growth.
7Another insight is that most games devel-
oped with the Godot Engine are mainly
2D games. This is also in line with the
statements from the Godot community
survey. On one hand, the Godot Engine
might offer more robust features for 2D
game development compared to its 3D
capabilities. On the other hand, the
amount of work involved in developing
3D games is usually higher than that of
2D games, which can be a challenge for
indie developers, causing them to favor 2D
development.
The methods of analysis used here have
raised many new questions. These should
continue to be investigated. The market
relevance in general or specifically for indie
game studios could be further analyzed.
Possible suggestions include interviews
with indie game studios that use the Godot
Engine. Additionally, in the case of Unity
and GameMaker, it would be interesting
to do further research to see if the Godot
Engine is slowly pushing them out of the
market.
One suggestion is to interview indie game
studios that use the Godot Engine to gain
further insights. Furthermore, direct com-
parisons, where appropriate, would be use-
ful to compare technical aspects between
the Godot Engine and other game engines.
Methods such as a feature matrix, bench-
marks or alternative methodologies would
be useful for this. Although the reasons for
Godot Engines growth in popularity are un-
clear, it can be concluded that the Godot
engine is highly relevant in the indie game
industry and will probably continue to grow
over the next few years.
