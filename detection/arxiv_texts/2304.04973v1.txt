Abstract
We analyzed All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS- SN), Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last
Alert System (ATLAS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satel lite (TESS) observations of CM Mic and found
that this object belongs to a small group of ER UMa stars showi ng standstills. In addition to typical ER UMa-
type cycles, the object showed standstills between 2017 and 2019 July, and in 2022. The supercycles varied
between 49 and 83 d. In 2015, the object showed outbursts with a cycle length of ∼35 d. An analysis of TESS
observations during the 2020 July outburst detected superh umps with a mean period of 0.080251(6) d (value
after the full development of superhumps). We also studied o ther ER UMa stars showing standstills mainly
using Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data. DDE 48, MGAB-V7 28 and ZTF18abmpkbj mostly showed ER
UMa-type supercycles but showed one or two standstills. MGA B-V3488 was mostly in ER UMa states with
short (∼25 d) supercycles in 2020–2022 similar to RZ LMi. This object also showed long standstills. PS1-
3PI J181732.65 +101954.6 showed ER UMa-type supercycles up to 2020 May and en tered a long standstill.
ZTF18abncpgs showed standstills most of the time, but also s howed ER UMa-type supercycles occasionally
between standstills. ZTF19aarsljl is a likely member of thi s group. MGAB-V284 showed a pattern similar to
ER UMa stars showing standstills but with a longer time-scal e of normal outbursts. This object seems to be
an ER UMa star with standstills above the period gap. None of t he objects we studied showed a superoutburst
arising from a long standstill, as recorded in NY Ser in 2018, although the 2019 June–July superoutburst of
PS1-3PI J181732.65 +101954.6 might have been an exception.
1 Introduction
ER UMa stars are a small group of SU UMa-type dwarf novae with v ery short (typically shorter than ∼80 d)1
supercycles and frequent normal outbursts (Kato and Kunjay a 1995; Robertson et al. 1995; Patterson et al. 1995;
Kato et al. 1999) [normal outbursts, however, can be suppres sed, see e.g., Zemko et al. (2013); Ohshima et al.
(2014) and normal outbursts sometimes may not occur frequen tly]. A small number of ER UMa stars and related
systems have been recorded to show standstills, which are th e deﬁning characteristic of the Z Cam-type dwarf
nova [for general information of cataclysmic variables (CV s) and dwarf novae, see e.g., Warner (1995)].
Such objects already reported in the literature are as follo ws.
• RZ LMi showed long-lasting superoutbursts in 2016–2017 (K ato et al. 2016). The general light curve and
the durations of the ﬂat parts are similar to the recently rep orted standstill of the AM CVn star CR Boo
(Kato et al. 2023). It appears that the phenomena recorded in RZ LMi can be interpreted as standstills.
• BK Lyn was originally considered as a novalike object (a CV w ith a thermally stable disk) (Skillman and
Patterson 1993; Ringwald et al. 1996). The object was found t o be in an ER UMa state in 2011–2012
(Kemp et al. 2012; Patterson et al. 2013; Kato et al. 2013). Th e object was probably in this state already
in 2005, but not as early as in 2002 (Kato et al. 2013). It retur ned to the novalike state in 2013 (Kato et al.
2013) and has been in this state since then. This object is pro bably essentially a novalike object with a
transient ER UMa state.
• NY Ser is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova in the period gap (Nogami e t al. 1998; Sklyanov et al. 2018).
Although supercycles were not as regular as in typical ER UMa stars, the shortest interval of conﬁrmed
superoutburst was 97 d (1996 April and July–Augurst, see Nog ami et al. 1998). This object also shows long
normal outbursts (Pavlenko et al. 2014) and the previous rep ort of a 85 d supercycle [Nogami et al. (1998),
adopted in Ritter and Kolb (2003)] is probably an underestim ate. Nevertheless, we include this object here
as an object related to ER UMa stars. This object showed two st andstills and superoutbursts arising from
them in 2018 (Kato et al. 2019). This was the ﬁrst demonstrati on that the disk radius can increase during
standstills.
1Short supercycles are a result of high mass-transfer rates. As Osaki (1995) showed, however, supercycles can become lon ger when
superoutbursts are long and their durations comprise most o f a supercycle, as we will see in RZ LMi and CM Mic in 2020. This
situation should be distinguished from systems with long su percycles but with short superoutbursts (i.e. ordinary SU U Ma stars).2
• MGAB-V859 and ZTF18abgjsdg were reported in Kato and Kojig uchi (2021) showing standstill phases in
addition to ER UMa-type behavior.
• WFI J161953.3 +031909 is an eclipsing object showing both a standstill and E R UMa states (Kato 2022b).
ER UMa stars are considered to have higher mass-transfer rat es than expected from the standard evolutionary
sequence of CVs, and are suspected to be descendants of old no vae (see e.g., Patterson et al. 2013). The presence
of standstills also favors a high mass-transfer rate as requ ired by the disk instability theory (see e.g., Osaki 1996).
ER UMa stars showing standstills have additional implicati ons: they are probably a result of variable mass-
transfer rates and how such standstills evolve provides a cl ue in understanding the evolution of the disk radius or
the angular momentum in the accretion disk (Kato et al. 2019) , which is still an unsolved problem (e.g., Kimura
et al. 2020).
In this paper, we show that CM Mic (=EC 20335 −4332) is yet another member of this small group of CVs.
This object was initially selected as a DC white dwarf (CS 229 43-206: Beers et al. 1992). Chen et al. (2001)
classiﬁed it as a possible dwarf nova with a range of B=14.9–15.9. Kazarovets et al. (2003) gave a variable star
name CM Mic and classiﬁed it as a novalike. This object did not receive much attention and it was only 2018
when the object was classiﬁed as a Z Cam star based on the All-S ky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-
SN, Shappee et al. 2014, Kochanek et al. 2017) observations ( T. Kato, vsnet-chat 80952). Using ASAS-SN and
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observation s (Ricker et al. 2015)3, this object was also identiﬁed
as an ER UMa star (N. Kojiguchi, vsnet-chat 89924).
2 Data analysis
We used ASAS-SN observations and Asteroid Terrestrial-imp act Last Alert System (ATLAS: Tonry et al. 2018)
forced photometry (Shingles et al. 2021) to examine the long -term behavior.
We used TESS observations, which recorded the initial part o f the 2020 July superoutburst, to analyze
superhumps. Superhumps maxima were determined using the te mplate ﬁtting method introduced in Kato et al.
(2009) after removing outburst trends by locally-weighted polynomial regression (LOWESS: Cleveland 1979).
The periods were determined using the phase dispersion mini mization (PDM: Stellingwerf 1978) method, whose
errors were estimated by the methods of Fernie (1989); Kato e t al. (2010). We also used Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF: Masci et al. 2019)5data for analysis of other objects given in section 4.
3 Results
3.1 Long-term behavior
Long-term light curves based on ASAS-SN and ATLAS data are sh own in ﬁgures 1 and 2.
In ﬁgure 1, the object showed outbursts with a cycle length of ∼35 d in 2015 (second panel). This pattern
became weaker in 2016 (third panel). The object stayed in sta ndstill in 2017 and 2018 (fourth and ﬁfth panels).
The behavior in 2014 (ﬁrst panel) was likely similar to 2015, but was uncertain due to the limited quality of the
ASAS-SN data.
In ﬁgure 2, the object was initially in standstill (ﬁrst pane l) with some hint of low-amplitude oscillation
with a period of 20–30 d. The object entered a dwarf nova state after BJD 2458680 (2019 July 15), followed
by a superoutburst on BJD 2458714 (2019 August 18)6. This superoutburst lasted long ( ∼55 d), as in long
superoutbursts or superoutbursts with a standstill in RZ LM i (Kato et al. 2016). The supercycle was 83 d. In
2020 (second panel), the object showed shorter supercycles (49–70 d) with some structures in the fading part of
the superhumps (such as at BJD 2459000 and 2459068). In 2021 ( third panel), the object showed a more typical

6We assume that all long outbursts in this object are superout bursts based on the detection of superhumps during one of lon g
outbursts in the TESS data (subsection 3.2).3
ER UMa-type variation with many normal outbursts but with va riable supercycles (53–67 d) and variable shapes
of superoutbursts. The superoutburst starting on BJD 24594 65 (2021 September 7) showed brightening in the
later part (BJD 2459488, 2021 October 1) as in 2020. The objec t was in standstill again in 2022 (fourth panel).
It has been in an ER UMa state in 2023 again (ﬁfth panel). The ER UMa-type behavior in 2020 and 2021 is
shown in more detail in an expanded scale in ﬁgures 3 and 4.
3.2 TESS observations
The times of superhump maxima are listed in table 1. The O−Cvariation together with the variation of
superhump amplitudes and the light curve is shown in ﬁgure 5. The peak of the superhump amplitudes occurred
aroundE=19. TESS observations covered superhump stages A and B [see Kato et al. (2009); Kato (2022c) for
superhump stages]. Using the linear part 2 ≤E≤12, we obtained a period of 0.0817(2) d for stage A superhumps .
It was somewhat ambiguous to deﬁne when stage B started. Usin g the range 30 ≤E≤262, the mean superhump
period (PSH) was 0.080251(6) d and the period derivative ( Pdot=˙P/P) was+2.0(2)×10−5. Using the range
50≤E≤262, these values were PSH= 0.080253(8) d and Pdot=+2.9(3)×10−5. The small positive Pdotwas
similar to +4(2)×10−5for ER UMa (Kato et al. 2009) and +3(3)×10−5for BK Lyn (Kato et al. 2013). As
shown in Kato and Osaki (2013); Kato (2022a), the mass ratio c an be determined from the stage A superhump
period if the orbital period is known. In the case of CM Mic, th e orbital signal was not detected in the available
TESS data and this is a future task possibly requiring a radia l-velocity study. A PDM analysis and the mean
proﬁle of superhumps from TESS observations are shown in ﬁgu re 6. The mean period (entire data with stages
A and B combined) was 0.080276(5) d.
The variation of the superhump proﬁle is shown in ﬁgures 7, 8 a nd 9. Figure 7 contains stage A and the
early phase of stage B. The amplitudes of the superhumps grew quickly and the period became shorter (early
stage B). Figures 8 and 9 show the evolution in stage B. The sup erhump amplitudes decayed with lengthening
of the superhump period, as shown in the O−Canalysis. No phase reversal was observed as in ER UMa (Kato
et al. 1996, 2003). This result suggests diversity in evolut ion of superhumps among ER UMa stars.
This superoutburst showed brightening in the later phase (s ubsection 3.1). In ordinary SU UMa stars, stage
C superhumps and an increase in the superhump amplitude are u sually associated with such brightening (see
e.g., Kato et al. 2009; Kato 2022c). It was unclear whether th e same thing happened in CM Mic due to the lack
of time-resolved photometric data.
4 Long-term light curves of other ER UMa stars with standstil ls
4.1 DDE 48
DDE 48 is a dwarf nova discovered by D. Denisenko in 2016 (vsne t-alert 201467). This object was identiﬁed as
an ER UMa star based on the detection of superhumps with a peri od of 0.067 d and frequent normal outbursts
(D. Denisenko, vsnet-alert 202918). A superhump was also reported in Kato et al. (2017). TESS ob servations in
2022 August also recorded a superoutburst (N. Kojiguchi in p rep.). The object was also classiﬁed as a Z Cam
star by the detection of a standstill in ZTF data (T. Kato, vsn et-chat 90599).
The long-term light curve is shown in ﬁgures 10 and 11. The obj ect showed ER UMa-type supercycles most of
the time. There was a standstill between BJD 2458826 (2019 De cember 8) and BJD 2458993 (2020 May 23). The
two superoutbursts preceding this standstill had longer du rations than the typical ones in this system (ﬁrst panel
of ﬁgure 10) and there was a shallow dip amid the superoutburs t plateau (BJD 2458770–2458777) just like in some
superoutbursts in CM Mic. The lengthening of superoutburst s toward the standstill was probably a manifestation
of the increasing mass-transfer rate. Just before the end of the standstill, small-amplitude oscillations appeared.
This probably reﬂected a part of the disk becoming thermally unstable due to the decreasing mass-transfer rate.
This object is also known as PS1-3PI J204611.81 +242057.2 (Sesar et al. 2017), ATO J311.5492 +24.3492 (Heinze
et al. 2018) and a Gaia variable Gaia DR3 184325410635461427 2 (type CV) (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022).

Figure 11: Light curve of DDE 48 in 2019–2022. The symbols are the same as in ﬁgure 10. There was a standstill
between BJD 2458826 (2019 December 8) and BJD 2458993 (2020 M ay 23) (end of the ﬁrst to the start of the
second panels) in addition to ER UMa-type supercycles.17
4.2 MGAB-V728
MGAB-V728 was discovered as a Z Cam star by G. Murawski in 2019 .10The ZTF light curve is shown in ﬁgure
12. A standstill was present in 2019. At other times, the obje ct displayed ER UMa-type behavior. This object
was also listed as a Gaia variable Gaia DR3 4530506601048215 296 (type CV) (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022).
Superhumps have not yet been conﬁrmed.
4.3 MGAB-V3488
This object was originally selected as a candidate RR Lyr sta r (PS1-3PI J045544.81 +653834.2: Sesar et al. 2017).
G. Murawski (MGAB-V348811reported it to be a Z Cam star. M. Bajer also reported its varia bility (BMAM-
V809). The object was identiﬁed as an ER UMa star with a short s upercycle ( ∼25 d) comparable to RZ LMi (T.
Kato, vsnet-chat 877812). The ZTF light curve us shown in ﬁgure 13. The object was in st andstill at least up to
2019 April. The object showed an ER UMa-type supercycle betw een BJD 2458694 (2019 July 29) and 2458720
(2019 August 24); normal outbursts were not recorded due to t he sparse coverage, then entered a standstill again.
This standstill ended by fading (BJD 2458903 = 2020 February 24). In 2020–2022, the object was mostly in ER
UMa states with short ( ∼25 d) supercycles. There was a possible standstill around BJ D 2459777 (2022 July 16)
to BJD 2459783 (2022 July 22), which was not well covered by ob servations. The ER UMa-type classiﬁcation of
the object was conﬁrmed by the presence of short outbursts be tween longer ones (superoutbursts). Superhumps
have not yet been conﬁrmed.
4.4 PS1-3PI J181732.65 +101954.6
This object was selected as a candidate RR Lyr star (Sesar et a l. 2017). T. Kato found it to be a dwarf nova
(vsnet-chat 848713). It was originally considered as an SS Cyg star, but later fo und to be an ER UMa star which
entered a standstill in 2020 May (T. Kato, vsnet-alert 2677614. The ZTF light curve is shown in ﬁgure 14. As
stated in vsnet-alert 26776, the behavior in 2018 (at least u p to BJD 2458358 = 2018 August 27) was atypical and
looked like repetitive rising standstills followed by dips , which are characteristics of an IW And star (Kato 2019).
Although there were time-resolved ZTF data during one of bri ghtening in 2018 (BJD 2458333–2458334 = 2018
August 3–4), regular superhumps were not recorded. We there fore consider that the behavior in 2018 was not a
variety of superoutbursts in an ER UMa star. The behavior, ho wever, did not perfectly match that of a typical
IW And star in that it did not show brightening just before a di p. There was a superoutburst in 2019 June–July,
which was not clearly preceded by a dwarf nova state and it loo ked like brightening from a plateau phase of
the preceding outburst. Superhumps were recorded during th is 2019 June–July outburst by ZTF time-resolved
photometry (ﬁgure 15). The mean superhump period during thi s interval was 0.08879(2) d. This object is also
known as BMAM-V769 (M. Bajer)15and ZTF J181732.64 +101954.5 (Ofek et al. 2020).
4.5 ZTF18abmpkbj
This object was originally selected as a candidate RR Lyr sta r (PS1-3PI J202831.22 +200027.3) (Sesar et al.
2017). The object was found to be an ER UMa star (T. Kato, vsnet -chat 864916). The classiﬁcation was updated
later (T. Kato, vsnet-chat 903717) based on a standstill starting in 2021 September. This obje ct was listed as
a variable star ZTF J202831.22 +200027.2 (Ofek et al. 2020). The ZTF light curve is shown in ﬁg ure 16. In
addition to ER UMa states, two standstills in 2018 and 2021 Se ptember–November were present. The ER UMa-
type supercycle starting on BJD 2458664 (2019 June 29) had ma ny normal outbursts between the superoutbursts
and the supercycle was long (71 d). The behavior became more r egular between BJD 2459052 (2020 July 21) and
2459411 (2021 July 15) showing typical ER UMa-type supercyc les with 42–56 d. More variations were recorded
during the 2021 standstill than in the 2018 one and the former may have shown weak dwarf nova-type outbursts

Figure 13: Light curve of MGAB-V3488 in 2018–2022. The objec t was in standstill at least up to 2019 April
(ﬁrst panel). The object showed an ER UMa-type supercycle be tween BJD 2458694 (2019 July 29) and 2458720
(2019 August 24) (second panel), then entered a standstill a gain. In 2020–2022, the object was mostly in ER

during the standstill. The object was again in a typical ER UM a state in 2022. Superhumps have not yet been
conﬁrmed.
4.6 ZTF18abncpgs
This object was originally selected as a candidate RR Lyr sta r (PS1-3PI J005932.18 +570342.7) (Sesar et al.
2017). AAVSO VSX (Watson et al. 2006) listed the object as a Z C am star in 2021. T. Kato (vsnet-chat 889618)
noted that this object is similar to the ER UMa star RZ LMi with variable supercycles in addition to a standstill.
The ZTF light curve is shown in ﬁgure 17. Since 2019, the objec t stayed in standstill much of the time while
there were occasional ER UMa states. In 2018, this object was apparently in an ER UMa state with a mean
supercycle of ∼52 d. The superoutburst starting on BJD 2458672 (2019 July 19 ) showed brightening in the later
phase. The next superoutburst had a long plateau (or a short s tandstill) as seen in RZ LMi (Kato et al. 2016).
The later standstill after 2020 May was interrupted by one or two ER UMa-type dwarf nova cycles. This object
is also known as ATO J014.8840 +57.0618 (Heinze et al. 2018) and ZTF J005932.18 +570342.7 (Ofek et al. 2020).
Superhumps have not yet been conﬁrmed.
4.7 ZTF19aarsljl
This object was originally selected as a candidate RR Lyr sta r (PS1-3PI J084907.10 −152526.7) (Sesar et al.
2017). T. Kato (vsnet-chat 906819) noted that this object is likely an ER UMa star with standsti lls. The ZTF
light curve is shown in ﬁgure 18. The part BJD 2459155 (2020 No vember 4) to BJD 2459304 (2021 March 30)
looks like an extended superoutburst followed by dwarf nova outbursts as in RZ LMi (Kato et al. 2016). The
short cycle between BJD 2458800 (2019 November 12) and 24588 80 (2020 January 31) suggests an ER UMa-type
object. The segment between BJD 2458424 (2018 November 1) an d 2458560 (2019 March 18) was apparently a
standstill. Although the quality of the data was not suﬃcien t due to the faintness of the object and the short
coverage by ZTF, we consider that this object is an ER UMa star close to the thermal stability as in RZ LMi
when it showed standstills. This object was also listed as a G aia variable Gaia DR3 5733518178924667392 (type
CV) (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022). Superhumps have not ye t been conﬁrmed.
4.8 MGAB-V284
This object was reported as a Z Cam star by G. Murawski.20T. Kato pointed out in vsnet-alert 2371621as
follows (typos corrected): “According to ZTF data, a large a nd long outburst triggered a standstill. The outburst
amplitudes between the standstills gradually grew up. Whil e the outburst amplitude just after the end of the
standstill is 2.5 mag and the duration is 3 d, the outburst amp litude just before the standstill is 3.5 mag and
the duration is 20 d. In addition, recurrence time might be 12 0 d according to Apparent Magnitude on Lasair
data (https://lasair.roe.ac.uk/object/ZTF18abgpmcd/) ”. This statement was based on ZTF Lasair data (Smith
et al. 2019) and is updated here using the most recent release of the ZTF data (ﬁgure 19). All “outbursts”
occurred after a sequence of short-period dwarf nova oscill ations and the behavior is most analogous to ER UMa
stars with long standstills, such as ZTF18abncpgs. The only diﬀerence is in the time scale: the cycle lengths
of normal outbursts are ∼10 d compared to ∼4 d in ER UMa stars. This diﬀerence implies that the orbital
period is longer than those of typical ER UMa stars. In recent years, however, a number of SU UMa stars above
the period gap have been identiﬁed, breaking the general con sensus (Warner 1995) such as BO Cet (Kato et al.
2021; Kato 2023a), MisV1448 (N. Kojiguchi et al. in preparat ion), ASASSN-18aan (Wakamatsu et al. 2021)
and ASASSN-15cm (Kato 2023b), and MGAB-V284 may be an ER UMa s tar with standstills above the period
gap. Although the period was not determined due to the very sm all number of observations, the large scatter
in the ZTF light curve around the peak of the 2018 October outb urst was suggestive of superhumps (ﬁgure 20).
Further observations around the peak of a future bright outb urst are requested. This object is also known as ZTF
J221257.97 +490644.4 (Ofek et al. 2020) and was also listed as a Gaia varia ble Gaia DR3 1975922107078810112
(type CV) (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2022).

5 Summary
We analyzed ASAS-SN, ATLAS and TESS observations of CM Mic an d found that this object belongs to a small
group of ER UMa stars showing standstills. The object showed typical ER UMa-type cycles between 2019 July
and 2021 November, and in 2023. It showed standstills betwee n 2017 and 2019 July, and in 2022. The supercycles
varied between 49 and 83 d, which probably reﬂected the varia ble mass-transfer rate. In 2015, the object showed
outbursts with a cycle length of ∼35 d in 2015 whose variations became weaker in 2016. An analys is of TESS
observations during the 2020 July outburst detected superh umps with a mean period of 0.080251(6) d (value after
the full development of superhumps). and a period of the grow ing stage of 0.0817(2) d. The period derivative
+2.0(2)×10−5was similar to those recorded in other ER UMa stars.
We also studied previously undocumented ER UMa stars showin g standstills mainly using ZTF data.
• DDE 48 mostly showed ER UMa-type supercycles but showed a st andstill in 2019 December–2020 May.
MGAB-V728 also mostly showed ER UMa-type supercycles but sh owed a standstill in 2019.
• MGAB-V3488 showed long standstills in 2018–2020, but was m ostly in ER UMa states with short ( ∼25 d)
supercycles in 2020–2022 similar to RZ LMi.
• PS1-3PI J181732.65 +101954.6 showed ER UMa-type supercycles up to 2020 May and en tered a long stand-
still lasting up to now.
• ZTF18abmpkbj mostly showed ER UMa-type supercycles but tw o standstills were recorded in 2018 and
late 2021. These standstills had larger variations than in o ther objects and this object may have shown
weak dwarf nova-type outbursts during the standstills.
• ZTF18abncpgs showed standstills most of the time, but also showed ER UMa-type supercycles in 2018 and
occasionally between standstills.
• ZTF19aarsljl is likely an ER UMa star with standstills, but the details were not clear due to the faintness.
• MGAB-V284 showed a pattern similar to ER UMa stars showing s tandstills but with a longer time-scale
of normal outbursts. We suspect that this object is an ER UMa s tar with standstills above the period gap.
None of the objects we studied showed a superoutburst arisin g from a long standstill, as recorded in NY Ser in
2018, although the 2019 June–July superoutburst of PS1-3PI J181732.65 +101954.6 may have directly occurred28
without experiencing a dwarf nova state and it could have bee n analogous to a superoutburst arising from a
standstill. The case of NY Ser appears to be very rare and we co uld not ﬁnd additional evidence that the disk
radius during standstills in ER UMa stars increases.
