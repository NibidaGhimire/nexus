Abstract
Given the high potential for applications utilizing the unique properties of single-
walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), there is considerable enthusiasm for addressing
the challenges associated with synthesizing SWCNTs with specific chirality. To eluci-
date the mechanisms that determine the chirality of SWCNTs during growth, intensive
1arXiv:2302.09264v5  [physics.comp-ph]  3 Dec 2024efforts have been devoted to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However,
the mechanism of chirality determination has not been fully clarified, which can partly
be attributed to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials in reproducing
the behavior of carbon and metal atoms. In this work, we develop a neural network
potential (NNP) for carbon-metal system to accurately describe the SWCNT growth,
and perform MD simulations of SWCNT growth using the NNP. The MD simula-
tions illustrate the defect-free, chirality-definable growth of SWCNTs, highlighting the
dynamic rearrangement of edge configurations and the consistency between the prob-
ability of edge configuration appearance and the entropy-driven edge stability model
proposed here. It is also shown that the edge defect formation is induced by vacancy
and suppressed by vacancy healing through adatom diffusion on the SWCNT edges.
These results provide insights into the edge formation thermodynamics and kinetics of
SWCNTs, an important clue to the chirality-controlled synthesis of SWCNTs.
Introduction
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have great potential1,2as a next-generation ma-
terial for nanoscale devices such as sensors, optoelectronic devices, and high-performance
logic transistors3–5because of their excellent physical properties.4,6The electronic structure
of SWCNTs dramatically varies from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chiral-
ity,7–9and chirality-controlled synthesis is important to obtain chirality-pure SWCNT sam-
ples without contamination and damage caused by sorting, and to realize high-end SWCNT-
based devices. Many experimental studies have been carried out to achieve chirality-controlled
growth of SWCNTs.2Although these impressive results shed light on chirality control, fur-
ther understanding of the chirality-determining SWCNT growth mechanism is needed to
produce higher purity SWCNT samples with arbitrary chirality in large quantity.
In the past few decades, theoretical models have been proposed to account for the chirality
distribution of SWCNTs.10,11These models successfully relate the state of the interface
2between the SWCNT edge and the catalyst to the chirality distribution, but do not provide
a detailed atomistic mechanism in the edge formation process because they are based on
some assumptions about the process of carbon addition to the SWCNT edges. To reveal
such mechanism, many molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have also been performed. In
particular, classical MD simulations, which are suitable for observing nanotube growth on a
long time scale, have demonstrated a series of growth processes from the nucleation to the
sidewall elongation.12–18As a first approach to the discussion of chirality in MD simulation,
Neyts et al.19,20performed hybrid atomistic simulations of MD and force-biased Monte Carlo
based on the reactive force field (ReaxFF). They defined the local chirality by the diameter
and the angle of the hexagon to the axial direction of SWCNTs. In their simulations of the
initial growth process of SWCNTs, chirality changes from zigzag to armchair were observed.
Yoshikawa et al.21carried out MD simulations with a lower carbon supply rate, and assigned
the chirality to SWCNTs by defect-free growth using the Tersoff-type bond-order potential.
This chirality-definable MD simulation demonstrated the kink-running process at SWCNT
edges predicted by the dislocation theory of SWCNT growth.10However, the chiralities of the
observed SWCNTs were only zigzag and near-zigzag, which is contrary to the experimental
reports of near-armchair preferential growth.22–25This suggests that the bond-order potential
shows an excessive preference for zigzag edges, as reported in a theoretical study,26and that
the preference for armchair edges over zigzag edges predicted by the DFT calculation is not
correctly reproduced by the bond-order potential.
Currently, there are two reasons why it is difficult to accurately simulate SWCNT growth.
Firstly, the time scale of MD simulations is smaller than that of experiments, and there is not
enough time for defects to heal during simulated SWCNT growth. Secondly, the energetics
of SWCNTs including defects is not accurately described by classical interatomic potentials.
For more accurate description of atomistic behavior in SWCNT growth, it is necessary to
perform long MD simulations using an accurate interatomic potential.
Recently, the application of artificial neural networks to interatomic potentials has been
3actively studied to overcome the limitations of conventional interatomic potentials and such
interatomic potentials are called neural network potentials (NNPs). Since the idea of sym-
metry functions to represent high-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) with trans-
lational and rotational invariance was proposed by Behler and Parrinello,27a number of ap-
proaches have been developed to construct NNPs in the field of materials science.28Among
the NNPs, the deep potential29is one of the most popular methods because of its high ac-
curacy and high computational efficiency. Hedman et al. have performed MD simulations of
SWCNT growth using the deep potential at the same time, with a different training dataset,
independently of this work,30and healing of interface defects was extensively studied.
In this study, we develop an NNP based on the deep potential for C-Fe system to accu-
rately simulate the SWCNT growth. The NNP is trained against iteratively collected 44000
structures, achieving good accuracy in the defect formation energy of graphene and the
thermodynamic stability of C-Fe nanoparticles. Using the developed NNP, we perform MD
simulations of the defect-free SWCNT growth by supplying carbon atoms to Fe nanoparti-
cles. The MD simulations demonstrate the process of defect-free chirality-definable SWCNT
growth with dynamic rearrangement of edge configurations, and the consistency between the
probability of edge configuration appearance and the entropy-driven edge stability predicted
from the nanotube-catalyst interfacial energy. We also discuss the mechanism of edge defect
formation and healing, which leads to the defect-free growth.
Results and discussion
Validation of NNP for Fe-catalyzed SWCNT Growth
The growth process of SWCNTs consists of the dynamic formation of carbon rings on
the catalyst surface through recombining carbon-carbon bonds. In order to reproduce the
SWCNT growth by MD simulation, interatomic potentials need to predict properties of
various morphology of C-Fe system including unstable structures. In this study, we used
4classical MD simulation for sampling dataset structures and trained an NNP that can ac-
curately predict the energies and forces of various structures including molecules, chains,
clusters, graphene, and nanotubes. Before focusing on the mechanism of SWCNT growth,
we validated the NNP from the perspectives of defect formation energy and edge free energy
of graphene, thermodynamic behavior of C-Fe nanoparticles.
Defect formation energies of graphene
To simulate SWCNT growth, a key parameter is the stability of defects. To validate the
NNP, we checked the predictive performance of defect formation energies of graphene for
the defective graphene dataset (Figure S1b), and compared it with conventional interatomic
potentials. Defect formation energy Dwas defined as
D=Ed/nd−Eg/ng. (1)
Here, EdandEgare the total energy of defective and ideal graphene structure, respectively.
ndandngare the number of atoms in the supercell of the defective and ideal graphene,
respectively. The comparison of defect formation energies between density functional theory
(DFT) calculation and the NNP is plotted in Figure 1a. The same plots for Tersoff-type
potential31and ReaxFF,32,33employed in previous SWCNT growth simulations, are also
shown. The plots indicate that the developed NNP much more accurately predicted the
defect formation energy than the other two interatomic potentials. The Tersoff-type potential
underestimated the defect formation energy, which is considered to result in more frequent
defect formation during SWCNT growth simulations.21,31In contrast, the ReaxFF potential
overestimated the defect formation energy and accordingly the stability of graphene, which
may have prevented cap lift-off driven by pentagon formation during the initial stages of
SWCNT growth.
5Edge energy of graphene
The edge energy is considered to be an important factor of SWCNT chirality selectiv-
ity.26,34To verify the NNP and discuss the chirality selectivity in terms of thermodynamic
stability, we checked the chiral angle dependence of the edge energy of graphene. To calcu-
late the edge energy by the NNP, we modeled graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in the cell with
one periodic direction and a vacuum space of 15 ˚A in the other two non-periodic directions.
We relaxed them with the conjugate gradient method. The edge energy γis defined as
γ= (Etotal−NCEC−Neµ)/2L, (2)
where Etotalis the total energy of the supercell, NCis the total number of carbon atoms in
the supercell, ECis the energy of carbon atoms in the graphene lattice, Neis the number
of terminating atoms, µis the chemical potential of the terminating element, and Lis the
periodic length of graphene nanoribbon as defined in a previous theoretical study.26We
computed the edge energy of the GNRs plotted as a function of chiral angle, as shown in
Figure 1b. For comparison, we also plotted the analytical curve26expressed as
γ′(χ) = 2 γ′
Asin (χ) + 2γ′
Zsin (30◦−χ), (3)
where χis the chiral angle, γ′
Aandγ′
Zare the edge energies of armchair and zigzag edge,
respectively. On pristine graphene edges, the energies computed with the NNP showed higher
stability of large chiral angles, which agreed with the generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) of DFT. On the other hand, those computed with the Tersoff-type potential indicated
higher stability of small chiral angles, which was considered to result in the zigzag preferential
growth by previous MD simulations.21

graphene as a function of chiral angle between DFT with GGA, the developed NNP, Tersoff-
type potential,31and ReaxFF.32,33The edge energies of graphene were directly computed
(dots) and fitted with Eq. 3 (lines).
Thermodynamic properties of Fe
The influence of the catalyst phase on SWCNT growth has been reported in experimental
studies.35,36In order to accurately simulate SWCNT growth, the thermodynamic behavior
of catalyst nanoparticles must be well considered. This section discusses the thermodynamic
behavior of Fe bulk crystals and nanoparticles. First, we estimated the melting point of
bulk body centered cubic (bcc) Fe by two-phase simulation37using the NNP. For two-phase
simulation, we prepared the initial structure of bulk Fe with a bcc-liquid interface by melting
the upper half of a bcc supercell of 28 .52×28.52×74.17˚A with 5200 atoms at 5000 K (Figure
S3a). Starting with the initial structures, we carried out MD simulations for 200 ps under
NPT ensemble at 1 atm with different temperatures. The final structures at 1850, 1887.5,
and 1900 K are shown in Figure S3b-d, and the potential energy was well converged at
each temperature, as shown in Figure S3e. The equilibrium temperature was 1887.5 ±12.5
K, which agrees well with the experimental melting point of 1811 K.38In addition, the
latent heat of melting was estimated as 0.15 eV/atom from the difference of the averaged
potential energies between solid and liquid, which also agrees with the experimental value
70.143 eV/atom39(Figure S3f).
Next, we verified the thermodynamic behavior of Fe nanoparticles by monitoring the
Lindemann index representing the root-mean-square relative bond-length fluctuation
δ=2

⟨r2
ij⟩ − ⟨rij⟩2
⟨rij⟩, (4)
where rijis the distance between atom iandj, N is the number of particles and the bracket
is the time average calculated over MD simulation at constant temperature T. The melting
point was determined as the temperature at which the Lindemann index changed discontin-
uously. Previous studies used a threshold value in the range of 0.08-0.15 as the melting point
criteria.40–45However, in the case of small nanoparticles, the solid and liquid phases coexist
over a wide temperature range, and the criteria for the melting point have not been well
established. In this study, to estimate the melting point, a hyperbolic function was fitted to
the data point of the Lindemann index. The mathematical form of the hyperbolic function
is expressed as
f(t) =(at+b) exp (t−v
s) + (ct+d) exp (−t−v
s)
exp (t−v
s) + exp ( −t−v
s)+w, (5)
where a,b,c,d,e,s,v, and ware fitting parameters. The melting point was determined
asTm=wwhere the inflection point of the fitted hyperbolic curve is located (see Figure
S4, Supporting Information). For MD simulation to obtain the Lindemann index, the initial
structures were prepared by melting Fe nanoparticles at 2000 K and then annealing them
to 0 K at 1 K/ps using the NNP. The annealed structures of Fe 200, Fe 600and Fe 2000are
shown in Figures 2a-c. The stable phase of Fe nanoparticles changed depending on the size.
For large nanoparticles ( N >700), the bcc structure was the stable phase as well as bulk
Fe. However, for medium-size nanoparticles (300 < N < 700), icosahedral (Ih) was found
stable. No regular structures were not observed for smaller nanoparticles ( N <300) as not
all possible magic number structures were used as a starting point in this first approach.
This phase transition from bcc to Ih by size, which was considered to be due to surface
8effect, is consistent with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observation of Ih
Fe nanoparticles.46Starting from the annealed structures, MD simulations were performed
for 2 ns at constant temperature Tand the Lindemann index was then obtained as the
average over the latter half 1 ns of MD simulations. According to the Gibbs-Thomson
equation, the decrease in the melting point is inversely proportional to the diameter. As
shown in Figure 2d, the melting point followed the equation for large nanoparticles of bcc
Fe. However, the melting point discontinuously changed by 300 K between Fe 600and Fe 800.
This discontinuity of the melting point corresponded to the phase transition from bcc to Ih.
In addition, the melting points of Fe 120Cnwere calculated, as shown in Figure 2e. The
melting point decreased from 814 K to 740 K with ∼2.5 % carbon content, while it increased
with more carbon content. The observed V-shape diagram is consistent with the phase
diagram of bulk Fe-C47and previous computational studies.40,48The following simulations
of SWCNT growth are performed under conditions where the Fe catalysts are fully liquid.

SWCNT Growth Simulation
Defect free growth of SWCNTs
Using the developed NNP, we carried out SWCNT growth simulations by supplying C
atoms to Fe nanoparticles in the same way as the previous SWCNT growth simulations.21,31
We firstly performed twenty MD simulations of SWCNT growth on Fe 55, Fe 80, Fe 100and
Fe120nanoparticles at T=1100-1500 K in 100 K increments to investigate the growth trends
10by temperature (Figure S5). Figure 3 shows the typical growth on Fe 120nanoparticles at (a)
1100 K, and (b) 1500 K. At lower temperatures (1100-1300 K), the mobility of carbon atoms
was limited, preventing their incorporation into a single large graphitic island. In these con-
ditions, isolated hexagons nucleated simultaneously at several sites on the surface. Multiple
graphitic islands then formed from these hexagons, covering the surface of the nanoparticles
without lift-off and leading to the deactivation. Conversely, at high temperatures (1400-1500
K), a single hexagon was formed, enabling the sequential addition of carbon atoms to cre-
ate a unified large island and the cap formation. Note that the threshold temperature is
supposed to depend on the carbon supply rate, and may differ from the experimental value
because the supply rate in this simulation is significantly higher than experiments.
Figure 3: Snapshots of the initial stages of SWCNT growth at (a) 1100 K and (b) 1500 K.
The blue and green atoms denote iron and carbon, respectively.
Figure 4a-h shows the SWCNT growth process at 1500 K on Fe 120. At this temperature,
SWCNTs grew through the typical growth stages; carbon saturation, cap formation, and
11side wall elongation, as reported in computational21,31and experimental50studies. In the
saturation stage, supplied C atoms in the gas phase were adsorbed on the catalyst surface
and preferentially occupied the subsurface sites (Figure 4a). When the subsurface sites
were fully occupied, carbon atoms formed small molecules such as dimer and trimer on the
surface (Figure 4b). The number of small molecules such as dimers and trimers continued
to increase, resulting in the carbon supersaturation of the catalyst (see Figure 4i).
In the cap formation stage, the small molecules started bonding and forming short chains
as the catalyst supersaturated. The cyclization of the chain led to the first ring formation
(Figure 4c). Note that as a trend over the catalyst sizes from Fe 55to Fe 120, the first ring is
likely to be a hexagon, which is contrary to the previous quantum mechanical molecular dy-
namics (QM/MD) simulations.51Additional polygons were formed next to the first hexagon
and a small graphitic island was formed (Figure 4d). The island was enlarged as C atoms
were supplied (Figure 4e,f), and the sixth pentagon formation finished the cap formation
(Figure 4g). The number of these small molecules such as dimer and trimer continued to de-
crease as they transformed into rings, gradually resolving the supersaturation of the catalyst
during this stage (see Figure 4i).
In the sidewall elongation stage, C atoms diffused on the catalyst surface and were bonded
with the SWCNT edge, forming a series of hexagons. In this stage, defects were often formed
on the edge, but healed into hexagons by bond recombination, resulting in the defect-free
SWCNT (Figure 4h). During this stage, the number of carbon molecules in the catalyst was
constant (see Figure 4i), and the monomers existed both on the surface and in the subsurface
region, while larger molecules containing more than two carbon atoms appeared only on the
surface region (see Figure 4j).

distribution function of C atoms in monomers, dimers, and trimers from the center of mass of

Figure 5a, and b compare the time evolution of the numbers of hexagons, pentagons, and
heptagons. The number of hexagons increased at a constant rate after the first formation.
13Note that in the case of the (8,7) SWCNT, the hexagon formation rate was 0.61 ring/ns
and the growth rate in length was 104µm/s, which is about 102times higher than the
experimental growth rates of SWCNTs52and about 3 times higher than that of the previous
SWCNT growth simulation performed using the classical interatomic potential by some of
us.21The number of pentagons increased to six during the cap formation and then fluctuated
but never fell below six during the sidewall elongation, indicating that the cap’s pentagons
were maintained. The number of heptagons was almost always zero; even when it reached
one, it immediately returned to zero. Figure 5c, and d show the detailed mechanism of
defect healing on the SWCNT edge. A pentagon was formed on the edge and healed into
hexagons by adding a monomer and C-C bond reformation (Figure 5c). A heptagon was
formed less frequently than a pentagon, and quickly healed to a hexagon by rejecting a
monomer (Figure 5d). Such defect healing close to the nanotube-catalyst interface resulted
in defect-free SWCNT growth.

are about to break.
Statistical analysis of edge configurations
During the growth of CNTs, the edge configuration dynamically changed depending on the
local structure such as armchair and zigzag edges. According to the thermodynamic model
proposed in previous studies,11,53the probability distribution of the edge configurations
of a nanotube is governed by the interfacial Gibbs energy between the nanotube and the
catalyst. To verify the consistency between the MD simulations and the thermodynamic
15model, we compared the probability distribution of appearance of edge configurations of a
nanotube predicted by the thermodynamic model and frequency distribution obtained from
the simulated SWCNT growth.
First, we classify the edge atoms in an ( n, m) nanotube into armchair, zigzag, antiarm-
chair, and antizigzag atoms, as shown in Figure 6a. If the nanotube has the smallest number
of edge atoms without vacancies and adatoms, ( n+m), and has iarmchair atom pairs, the
number of edge atoms in each category satisfies the following equations:
NZ+NA+NZ′+NA′= 2n+ 2m, (6)
NZ=NZ′=n+m−2i, (7)
NA=NA′= 2i, (8)
where NZ,NA,NA′, and NZ′are the number of armchair, zigzag, antiarmchair, and antizigzag
atoms, respectively. As an example, we consider the edge configurations satisfying Eq.6-8 in
the (8,7) SWCNT growth simulation, as shown in Figure 6b. In the DeepMD architecture,
the potential energy of the system is calculated as a sum of the atomic energy predicted from
the local atomic environment of each atom. Thus, the interfacial energy can be estimated
from the difference between the atomic energy of edge atoms and that of atoms in the
nanotube. Figure 6c shows the probability density for the atomic energy of armchair, zigzag,
antiarmchair, antizigzag edge atoms, and tube atoms, which are 3-coordinated carbon atoms
not categorized as edge atoms, obtained from the (8,7) SWCNT growth simulation. The
density of states for each category shows a unimodal distribution, and the peak positions
for the edge atoms are shifted in a positive direction compared to that for the tube atoms,
indicating the energy loss due to the nanotube-catalyst interface. With ignoring the effects
of the tube atoms, the interfacial energy EInt(n, m, i ) of an ( n, m) nanotube with iarmchair
atom pairs can be approximately calculated from the difference in the peak positions of the
16distributions for the edge atoms as
EInt(n, m, i ) = (n+m−2i)(EZ+EZ′) + 2i(EA+EA′) (9)
= (n+m)(EZ+EZ′) + 2i∆EInt, (10)
where EZ,EZ′,EA, and EA′are the peak positions for zigzag, antizigzag, armchair, and
antiarmchair atoms relative to that for tube atoms and ∆ EInt=EA+EA′−EZ−EZ′. The
specific value of ∆ EIntdepends on the condition of the nanotube-catalyst interface. In the
(8,7) SWCNT growth simulation, EA,EA′,EZ, and EZ′were 1.325, 0.298, 1.052, and 0.702
eV, respectively, and ∆ EIntwas thus −0.131 eV. Using the interfacial energy EInt(n, m, i ),
the canonical partition function Z(n, m) for the edge configurations is calculated as
Z(n, m) =mX
i=1g(n, m, i ) exp
−EInt(n, m, i )
kBT
, (11)
where Tis the temperature of the system and g(n, m, i ) is the number of unique edges of an
(n, m) nanotube with iarmchair pairs. The probability distribution of appearance of edge
configurations P(n, m, i ) is then calculated as
P(n, m, i ) =g(n, m, i ) exp (−EInt(n, m, i )/kBT)
Z(n, m)(12)
=g(n, m, i ) exp(−2i∆EInt/kBT)Pm
i=1g(n, m, i ) exp(−2i∆EInt/kBT). (13)
The degeneracy g(n, m, i ), i.e. the number of edges of a ( n, m) nanotube with iarmchair
pairs, depends on the number of discernible species defining the nanotube edge. In the
previous models, the edge was defined as a set of zigzag atoms and armchair atoms pairs,
assuming either a constant number of armchair and zigzag species11or letting them fluctuate
to account for oblique edges with respect to the tube axis.53In the latter, g1(n, m, i ) was
17calculated as the number of combinations of iarmchair sites and n+m−2izigzag sites:
g1(n, m, i ) =n+m−i
i
=(n+m−i)!
i!(n+m−2i)!, (14)
and in the former, g0(n, m) was the limiting case for i=m.
g0(n, m) =n!
m!(n−m)!, (15)
These simple approximations of g(n, m, i ) emphasized the role of the edge configurational
entropy in carbon nanotube growth, but were incomplete in the sense that the role of an-
tiarmchair and antizigzag species that connect armchair and zigzag ones was overlooked.
It is however possible to include all these four species and obtain an exact evaluation of
the degeneracy g2(n, m, i ) by defining edge configurations as sets of n a 1vectors and m a 2
vectors, the unit vectors of a graphene unit cell. The derivation of g2(n, m, i ) is explained in
Supporting Information and Figures S6 and S7. Another mathematically rigorous proof was
provided by F. Ducastelle.54

Figure 6d shows the probability distribution P(n, m, i ) with ∆ EInt=−0.131 eV and T=
300, 900, 1500, and 3000 K. The frequency distribution obtained from the simulated (8,7)
SWCNT growth at 1500 K is also shown for comparison. The predicted distribution at 1500
K is consistent with the frequency distribution from the growth simulation at 1500 K in terms
of the order of probability of appearance. The same analysis was performed on the (9,9)
SWCNT, as shown in Figure S8. For the (9,9) SWCNT, ∆ EIntwas calculated as −0.083 eV.
As in case of the (8,7) SWCNT, the predicted distribution P(n, m, i ) at 1500 K is also con-
18sistent with the frequency distribution obtained from the (9,9) SWCNT growth simulation.
The temperature dependence and the interfacial energy dependence of P(n, m, i ) calculated
with g1andg2for various chiralities are shown in Figure S9 and Figure S10, respectively.
The difference in counting edges leads to qualitative differences in the temperature and in-
terfacial energy dependence of P(n, m, i ). As a general trend, as the temperature decreases,
the distribution of edge configurations becomes narrower and ultimately only configurations
with marmchair pairs survive, as expected when the configurational entropy goes to zero.
Note that on the assumption that nanotubes grow with the edge configurations satisfying
Eq.6-8, ( n,1) nanotubes should grow by the kink-running process regardless of the values of
Tand ∆ Eas reported in the previous MD simulations by Yoshikawa et. al.21because only
edge configurations with one antiarmchair site are allowed, as shown in Figures S9 and S10.

20Effect of ring formation at antizigzag sites
The above discussions have been based on the assumption that rings are formed only at
antiarmchair sites, but in the MD simulations there are cases where rings are formed at
antizigzag sites as well, which is also important for the growth mechanism of SWCNTs. At
antizigzag sites, adatoms often formed a protruding pentagon which is thermodynamically
unfavorable. The adatoms frequently jumped to adjacent antizigzag sites with repeated
bonding and dissociation like a trapeze. When they reached an antiarmchair site, they
formed a hexagon and are stabilized (Figure 7a). Such adatom diffusion healed the vacancies,
preventing defect formation (Figure 7b).
In the MD simulations, unhealed vacancies occasionally resulted in defects as shown in
Figure 8, because the growth rate in the simulations was much higher than that in the
experiments and there is not enough time for vacancy to heal. In the experiments, however,
SWCNTs are considered to grow while maintaining smooth edges through adatom diffusion,
resulting in a low probability of defect formation.
21Figure 7: (a) Adatom diffusion along the zigzag edge of the (10,7) SWCNT. (b) Edge vacancy
healing by adatom diffusion on the (8,7) SWCNT. The dotted lines indicate the bonds that
are about to break.
On armchair edges, pentagons were quickly healed to hexagons by adding monomers
because such pentagons had dangling bonds and were highly reactive, as shown in Figure
5a. However, on zigzag edges, pentagons without dangling bonds were often formed at edge
vacancies (Figure 8b). Such pentagons were less reactive, resulting in less susceptibility to
monomer addition and more chances of being left unhealed inside the sidewalls. Heptagons
were often formed below the pentagons to compensate for the curvature change by the
pentagon formation, resulting in pairs of adjacent pentagons and heptagons (5-7 defects).
225-7 defects caused chirality changes as reported in previous experimental studies.55–57An
SWCNT with 5-7 defect-mediated chirality change is shown in Figure 8a. The SWCNT
grew to a certain length with the initial chirality (11,7) determined by the cap and changed
to (10,7) by a 5-7 defect. We also observed the chirality change from (10,3) to (8,3) by two
5-7 defects (Figure S11).

Snapshot and developed view of the SWCNT with chirality change from (11,7) to (10,7)
after 280 ns of carbon supply. (b) 5-7 defect formation process. The pink and orange
areas are (11,7) and (10,7) sidewalls, respectively. The light blue areas can be defined as
(11,7) and (10,7) since there are two possible translation vectors. The chirality of the white
areas can not be assigned. The red and blue polygons denote the pentagons and heptagons,
respectively.
Conclusions
We performed MD simulations of defect-free SWCNT growth using the NNP. The MD
simulations showed the structural evolution of nanotube edges with dynamic rearrangement
of edge configurations. We compared the probability of appearance of the edge configu-
rations with the thermodynamic model reported in previous work and demonstrated that
23the probability can be predicted from the nanotube-catalyst interfacial energy. It was also
observed that the vacancy, which is caused by the ring formation at the anti-zigzag sites,
leads to the formation of defects and that the adatom diffusion along the edges contributes
to the healing of vacancies. These observations explain how a nanotube edge is formed and
changed during the growth and provide a clue for realizing the chirality-controlled synthesis
of SWCNTs.
Method
Development of the NNP
To collect dataset structures covering a wide range of PESs, we sampled three types of
atomic structures: disordered structures, defective graphene, and structures obtained from
SWCNT growth simulations. The disordered structures were obtained by randomly placing
atoms in a computational cell of 8-20 ˚A per side, heating them to 10000 K by classical
MD simulation using a Tersoff-type potential,31and then quenching them to 1000-5000 K
(Figure S1a). The defective graphene structures were collected by preparing graphene in a
hexagonal supercell of 17.24 ×17.24×10.0 ˚A, randomly displacing carbon atoms by 0-4 ˚A,
and relaxing them using Tersoff-type potential (Figure S1b). The CNT growth structures
were sampled from MD simulations of SWCNT growth on Fe 55using Tersoff-type potential
and NNP under development (Figure S1c). The cell size of the CNT growth structure was set
to 15.0 ×15.0×15.0˚A so that the length of the vacuum space is about 10 ˚A. The numbers
of atomic configurations included in the disordered, defective graphene and CNT growth
datasets are 21744, 16871, and 5776, respectively. Each dataset was randomly separated
into three subsets, with 10% as the validation set, 10% as the testing set, and the remainder
as the training set.
We performed spin-polarized DFT calculations using the projector-augmented wave (PAW)
method,58Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation for exchange-
24correlation functional,59,60with 400 eV plane wave energy cutoff, and the k-point mesh for
the Monkhorst-Pack grid Brillouin zone sampling (N k1, N k2, N k3) = (3 ,3,3) for the dis-
ordered structures and (1 ,1,1) for the defective graphene and CNT growth structures, as
implemented in Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4.4).61–64The convergence
criterion for the electronic self-consistent loop was set to 10−4eV.
Deep potential29was used for training the NNP. We used the ”se e2a” descriptor imple-
mented in DeePMD-kit.65The cutoff radius is set to 4 .0˚A. The smoothing function was set
between 3.5-4.0 ˚A. For the embedding net, the sizes of the hidden layers from the input end
to the output end are 25, 50, and 100, respectively. For the fitting net, three hidden layers
with 240 neurons were used. Parameter optimization was performed in 2,000,000 steps. An
exponentially decaying learning rate from 0.001 to 3.51 ×10−8was applied. Comparisons of
the energies and the forces between DFT and NNP are shown in Figure S2. The MAEs of
the energies are 16.9 meV/atom and 16.1 meV/atom for the training set and testing set, and
the MAEs of the forces are 0.268 eV/ ˚A and 0.248 eV/ ˚A for the training set and testing set,
respectively.
SWCNT Growth Simulation
MD simulations were performed using LAMMPS.66The time step for numerical integration
was 0.5 fs. The temperature of Fe nanoparticles was controlled at Tusing the Nose-Hoover
thermostat.67,68The simulation box was a cubic cell with a size of 200 ×200×200˚A. The
periodic boundary condition was applied for each direction of the axis. At the beginning of
the simulation, we placed Fe 55−120nanoparticles at the center of the cell. After relaxation at
constant temperature for 2 ns, we supplied C atoms at random positions in the cell controlling
the density of C atoms in the gas phase at 8 atoms/cell. The initial velocity vectors of C
atoms vwere randomly determined, assuming that the temperature of the system is Tand
the magnitude of the initial vector |v|satisfies |v|=p
3kbT/m. In order to describe the
energy barrier of the carbon feedstock decomposition, a Lennard-Jones potential was applied
25between non-covalent C atoms, as in previous SWCNT growth simulations.21,31OVITO69
was used for the visualization of the atomic structures and the common neighbor analysis.
The developed views were made by expressing the coordinates of the SWCNT by the
cylindrical coordinates ( r, θ, η ) and projecting them onto the x-z plane using the equation
x=C×θ,y= 0, η=z, where C is a constant that represents the average radius in the
tube direction of the SWCNTs to be developed. The chirality ( n, m) of each SWCNT was
determined by the positive combination of the basis vectors of the developed SWCNT, a1
anda2, according to the original definition of the chirality.
